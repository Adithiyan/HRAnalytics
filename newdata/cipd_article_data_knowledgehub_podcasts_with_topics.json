Will the new youth guarantee for 18-21-year-olds actually help to address economic activity among young people? Are you alert to the practice of 'malicious compliance'? And what bold predictions do our panel have for the profession in 2025?\nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by bestselling author and host of Eat, Sleep, Work, Repeat podcast, Bruce Daisley; director at Willow HR, Laura Callahan; OD consultant at Distinction Business Consulting, Garin Rouch; and CIPD's senior policy advisor on skills, Lizzie Crowley.\nRecorded 6 December 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 13: Professor Michael Wooldridge Special\nDuration: 22:06\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza (DDS): Hello, and welcome to this special episode of the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting the profession and the world of work. My name is David D'Souza, I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD, and I'm thrilled to welcome a very special guest for this episode. Joining me in a quite makeshift studio from the CIPD Annual Conference and Exhibition in Manchester is Professor Michael Woodridge. Hello.\nProfessor Michael Wooldridge (MW): Hello, nice to be here.\nDDS: And thank you very much for taking your time out to be with us. For those of you not in the know, Michael is an academic and author who specialises in artificial intelligence, described himself earlier, I think, as being only known for the Ladybird Expert Guide to AI.\nMW: Well, I got asked to write a Ladybird book on artificial intelligence, and I'm sure many of your listeners will remember the Ladybird series. They were. They were kind of completely ubiquitous when I was a kid and I couldn't say no, but I was really worried that a lot of my colleagues were going to kind of think this was a bit sort of beneath me or, you know, not really an appropriate thing to do but an amazing number of them said, how do I get to do one as well? So, I'm very proud of having done it.\nDDS: Absolutely. Making difficult things accessible is a skill in itself, isn't it? I bought four or five of those books for my daughter recently. I found them in her room and they were about professions, so it was quite interesting. So, there were certain professions, it just went, this is a man who does and then it would say, and there is some secretarial work always done by women. So, they were quite, you know, going back to the 1950s.\nMW: Well, the 1950s, 60s, 70s books certainly had some stereotypes, which we wouldn't regard as acceptable today.\nDDS: Excellent.\nMW: Just put it that way.\nDDS: And I would urge...\nMW: I hope my book is free of those.\nDDS: I would suggest that people buy it in time for Christmas, just to kind of check.\nMW: Absolutely.\nDDS: So, you split your time working as a professor of AI at the Educational Upstart, the University of Oxford, and also as director of AI for the Alan Turing Institute, as well as obviously authoring books. You were awarded the Lovelace Medal from the BCS for your contributions, the advancements of information systems, and a range of other awards as well. So, you're absolutely the person we should be having this conversation with, and far more reliable than most of the large language models that people might be drawing upon.\nMW: Well, that I think I could hopefully agree with, yes.\nDDS: And you gave an example in your speech earlier about your educational attainments being shifted by a large language model. So, it's suggesting you'd attended a different university?\nMW: Yeah, so this is a completely true story. So, back in 2020, a program called GPT-3 was released and GPT-3 was the predecessor to ChatGPT, which many of your listeners will have played with. And in fact, GPT-3 is the technology that really underneath ChatGPT. And so, I was playing with it and just asked it if it knew anything about me. I knew that the training data included, roughly speaking, everything on the World Wide Web and I have a web page, so I wondered if it knew anything about me. But I had to prompt it a bit, it turns out there's a BBC News reporter called Mike Wooldridge, there's also an Australian health minister but finally, we got to me and mostly what it said about me was that I was a truthful person, broadly speaking. But it said I studied as an undergraduate at Cambridge and this is really weird, because I'd never had any affiliation, I never studied there. I've never lived there. So, why would it do that? And really, the reason that it does that is that it's read lots of biographies of Oxford professors and studying at Cambridge or Oxford is very, very common for an Oxford professor. Now, it happens I didn't but in the absence of any information to the contrary, it just makes its best guess about what's true and in this case, it guessed I'd gone to Cambridge. So, it did occur to me afterwards, I should have asked for a pay rise if I had a Cambridge education. I think that's...\nDDS: It's worth a try. I mean...\nMW: Much better qualified.\nDDS: I'll go the other way. So, having done similar in the past, I gained a couple of extra children and moved to Cambridge. So, I apologise to the children that I pay less attention to than my daughter. So, AI has never really been a fringe topic. It's always been an interesting topic but you described it as going viral. So, very much kind of hitting a critical mass in terms of interest over the last few years with 2005 being an initial turning point, but then the release of ChatGPT, moving it into a next space. I want to concentrate on particularly the impact on the profession and the world of work. But actually, it'll be really interesting to get your view on how mainstream is it? And actually, what can we see or expect over the next few years in terms of adoption and usage?\nMW: If you go back 20 years, actually AI was very much on the fringes. It wasn't, it was in some areas wasn't regarded as a respectable thing to do at all and you know, people were who wanted to study neural networks, which is the AI technology, which, which has started to work recently, and which all of the AI fuss is about, you know, we're being quietly advised, you know, this isn't a good area to go into, it's not quite respectable, and so on. But then it really started to work around about 2005, took off big time around about 2012 and then it got supercharged with the release of ChatGPT. And the reasons for that are really that to make neural networks work, this core AI technology, you need lots data and lots of computer power, and they became available in the last couple of years. So, what this has opened is a floodgate of enormous number of potential applications of this technology, many of which are going to be relevant, but you need to go into adopting this technology with your eyes very, very wide open, I think and one of the crucial things that you need to be aware of is that this is not infallible technology. This is technology that gets things wrong a lot, that it can't be relied upon at a moment in mission-critical scenarios. You absolutely shouldn't be letting this technology decide whether somebody gets a job or a pay rise or something like that. All of that should be reserved for human judgment. I'd be very, very cautious in even about taking advice from this technology in areas like that. So, it has lots of applications, but you need to be aware of its limitations. I think that's just so crucially important.\nDDS: Yeah, we're actually piloting for anyone who is a CIPD member, we're piloting an AI-enabled solution to provide people with up to date guidance from our background. We're deliberately doing that in pilot just because of that reliability issue, and we've asked it not to address certain issues because of that reliability challenge. So, it's quite interesting having people frustrated with us because actually it won't answer a question that's deliberate because we can't get it to answer that question reliably, particularly in a space where changing a few words around when it comes to employment law, it has massive ramifications.\nMW: My worry there, though, by the way, is that one real danger is that people take AI far too seriously, that they listen to the advice and they just assume the advice they're getting is correct. You know, AI says no, it's like the old joke, you know, computer says no, and people just listen to it blindly and don't want to question what's going on or why that decision is being made. So, I do think really important, you know, you have to be prepared to question. You shouldn't just accept what an AI tells you as being gospel. You need to be ready to question it and demand more information, demand explanation, and to question those explanations.\nDDS: Completely and that's part of being a professional, isn't it? It's bringing your expertise to bear on the solution. So, if AI can help us access some of the information that we need more rapidly, that's fine. But actually, having the professional knowledge and expertise to understand the boundaries is really important. Just before we go into some more specifics around the profession, we're going to speak for about 20 minutes. It won't be any longer than that, I don't think. I will definitely use some loose language. You're less likely to, but it's definitely a space where actually people need to understand the ramifications of what's happening, even if they don't need to understand the deep tissue, if you like, of the technology. What are some of the things that most annoy you or get your goat as we're kind of talking about these topics in terms of the language that's used incorrectly, where you think it's unhelpful for people to do that?\nMW: I think it's science fiction language is there's this, I mean, because we all watch movies and play computer games and read books where AI features prominently. And some of that kind of worldview seeps into the discussion about AI and that's incredibly damaging, I think, and incredibly worrying and in particular, this idea about, you know, when people use phrases like superhuman to refer to AI, if you think about what a pocket calculator could do, it's superhuman in its ability to do sums, but that's not very interesting. It's not really superhuman intelligence and all AI programs are glorified pocket calculators. So, using, using terms like superhuman, or even, and I know I do this, and I've done it already in this podcast, when you talk about the machine thinks, machine isn't thinking anything in realistically, but it's very easy to start applying that language to it. So, using human terms to refer to things that the machine is doing, I think is that's the number one concern and it's I say it's a habit that's very easy to get into and I know I do it from time to time, but it's really important to avoid doing it.\nDDS: Excellent. So, we're going to talk a little bit about the profession and actually it's led us into a horrible place, because I was going to use one of your quotes, where it very much is anthropomorphising kind of the concept. But there's a lovely quote from you in The Guardian where you said that AI could become I think it was the ultimate bad boss. So, surveilling employees to work out who gets fired, selection decisions, those kinds of things and I was just wondering what principles employees should keep in mind when implementing AI in their workplace. So, what are the first things that organizations should be thinking about before taking that step? Because there's a lot of pressure in organisations to act fast. But acting fast and acting well might be very different things.\nMW: So, I think the most important single thing is not to hand control to AI. AI can be another voice in the room but we have to be trained to recognise that he is just another voice in the room, and it shouldn't be calling the shots. So, the example that I use in a Guardian interview, what I was talking about there was this emerging class of systems that some companies are starting to release where basically AI monitors everything that you do in your working life.\nSo, a lot of us basically spend most of our working lives in front of a computer, answering emails, filling in forms on web pages, filling in spreadsheets, and so on. But imagine that an AI is monitoring every single thing that you do and every email that you send, you get a critique of that email. I didn't like your use of these terms in this email, you didn't upsell our product, why didn't you mention this latest product there? Be more positive in your outlook. You know, I imagine that every single thing that you do at work, you're getting that kind of critique and every week, you're getting a summary. You took 10% more comfort breaks this week than you did last week and by the way, that's 20% more than the company average. You know, please try to moderate your comfort breaks. All of that kind of stuff going to the point where, you know, you have an AI-driven PDR, you know, where this sort of stuff is automatically, all of that data, every keystroke that you type in your computer, every mouse click, that you make on your computer, goes to an AI that analyses it and critiques it. That's a very scary prospect. It absolutely is not an unrealistic one and there are some products that are coming out under the guise of management information tools that do that kind of thing, or the elements of that kind of thing already and I think the problem with that is it just reduces us to human robots, where more or less sort of end up with no scope for human robots originality or thought or personality that we're just reduced to the tasks that a machine can't do on our behalf.\nSo, there's a famous example from a large online retailer that I won't name, but you can possibly guess and if you work in one of their warehouses, you'll have something that looks like a smartphone, which is telling you, you know, go to aisle number three and shelf B, pick up three of items number 10, then pick up another three. So, why doesn't it just ask you to pick up six of those items? Because it doesn't translate trust you to count to six, it's completely dehumanising. It's completely alienating in that respect, just eliminating all of human thought, originality, and so on and that's profoundly unsatisfactory for people that are going to be in those jobs.\nDDS: Yeah and it doesn't understand, I guess, the psychology of people either. So, if you'd have said, how do you create the world's best and most productive workplace? The starting point for many wouldn't be, well, I need someone looking over my shoulder the entire time and yet that's what we've got the temptation to create with the technology, because the capability is there, but whether we use it or not is a separate question. So, I often say we shouldn't let the risks blind us to the opportunities, but we shouldn't let the opportunities blind us to the risks either and it is really tempting to steam ahead with some of these things. Where are you seeing organisations starting to use things in a more positive way, where you go, actually, look, there's genuine time saving there, that's freeing people up to be more capable or improving jobs.\nMW: Well, in my own area in science, it's being completely transformative. It's just like we've got this incredibly powerful tools suddenly available, which is allowing people to think about what they do in completely new ways. I mean, it's as transformative as the arrival of the computer. And so, we're seeing really a seismic shift. I mean, what we call in science, a paradigm shift. You know, it's fundamentally changing the way that we do science. So, a beautiful example, just from DeepMind, a London-based AI company headed by Demis Hassabis. And Demis and one of his colleagues got a Nobel Prize two weeks ago for work on a program called AlphaFold. And what AlphaFold does is a classic science problem called protein structure prediction. Now, we don't need to understand what protein structure prediction is, except that firstly, it's very important and secondly, previously, it was really time-consuming and expensive to do. It would take you months and now, a student can do that on their computer in a matter of minutes.\nAnd what that means is it's just massively accelerating that scientific process and we're going to see change reverberate through science. Now, of course, most of us aren't doing protein structure prediction in our job. But actually, these AI tools, I think, are going to enable us to be much more productive in routine white-collar jobs. I mean, a lot of the stuff that we find routine, but a little bit tedious, like, you know, you've got a big, long document and your boss wants a summary of it. Stuff like that will be much easier to do in the future. Extracting the key points, more interesting one, taking two different documents, presenting two different viewpoints and what are the points of commonality and how do they differ? You know, how are they disagreeing with each other? And AI is going to be able to help us do that much, much more quickly. So, I think for me, the key word is productivity.\nDDS: And it goes back to that point that you made, there's something around analysis versus decision making that sits within that. So, having AI, being able to rapidly compare large tracts of text to then enable people to make decisions around them in the background. So, you said that you weren't overly pessimistic about the impact on the job market. I think that was the kind of wording you used. But there's obviously an impact on skills, no matter what happens. So, the world's changing, we need to change with it and we need to have some agency over that change. What do I think the biggest changes in the skills people need are? Or actually, by its very nature, in terms of its accessibility, is this actually a time where it's going to democratise skills or reduce the need or complexity of access to some spaces?\nMW: Well, I think this is part of an ongoing trend. It's something that your readers will be very, very familiar with. You know, we're no longer in a world where you go to school, you then maybe go to university, you learn some skills, and that's it for your working life. Those days are long, long, long past and we are in a world where you need to continually update your skill set. So, I mean, and this is part of that much, much bigger trend. The skills here, actually, interestingly, the most relevant skills for your profession, I think, are about understanding what this technology is good and not good.\nFor understanding its failure modes, to use the terminology you know where it can go wrong, how is it likely to go wrong and understanding that. And understanding that sweet spot between where you're getting the benefits from the technology, but you're not taking risks with it, and you're not playing fast and loose with people's jobs, so on. So, understanding that and a lot of it is about being ready to question the AI. There are some more practical things like if you're using large language models then being able to understand how to coax the best out of them, what's called prompt engineering is the skill set there that people use, that's something that people can learn, but actually I think for most people aren't going to be doing prompt engineering in their role. Most people are going to be encountering AI just as a productivity tool to help them do summarisation and translation and extracting key bullet points from. So, I really do think you know, actually top of my list of priorities are understanding what benefits this technology can bring, but actually as important, if not more important, what are the key risks? How can it go wrong? How can you spot those where it goes wrong and how can you train yourself not to fall into the traps when you use this technology?\nDDS: I think what's really interesting there is that it's not about learning the complexity of how this is built from the ground up, it's no, it's about learning the capability and limitations to it. You mentioned something really interesting there which is about the difference between it being utilised as a standalone technology for chat versus being embedded into other systems. Do you actually think the future of this Is more likely that it's just going to turn up in the systems.\nMW: Oh, absolutely. It's going to be everywhere, every time you make a decision, it's going to be embedded there. A nice example is satellite navigation systems, so satnav systems, they're about 20 years old. It was around about 2003-2004 that they first started to appear, and at the time they were very expensive and they were kind of a bit of a status symbol at the time, if I recall correctly. And now they're completely ubiquitous, we've all got sat nav systems on our smartphones and so on.\nBut what satnavs do is they take the strain of a routine but tedious cognitive activity, you know, before satnavs navigating in the Wooldridge car was a very sweary activity. I have to tell you know, the language was not good that we used to use because it wasn't in principle a difficult thing to do to follow a map and to navigate, but it was tedious and it was error prone. Is this a junction? I'm not sure if this is a junction, yes, that was the junction, you know, that kind of thing but what satnavs do is they take the strain of that activity, they just take that routine but tedious activity away from you and make you smarter. Just on my travel here, you know, there was some roadworks on the M6, and the satnav automatically re-routed us completely seamlessly around that and we barely noticed it was even there. We didn't, you know, we didn't even have to pay attention and previously, that would have been a really tedious and irritating thing to have to do, frantically pouring over maps. So, the way to think about it is that AI is going to be everywhere, that you make a decision in exactly the same way that the satnav is helping you, it's going to be helping you to make better decisions.\nDDS: And the key with the satnav is, you're still making the decision. So, once every six months or so, you'll see someone who's driven into a river because their satnav told them to, or a lorry stuck under a bridge, right. There was a famously a couple that drove into the middle of Venice, which is quite difficult to do given the way it's designed because they followed their satnav. The key is that we retain the agency over it and I think that's a key thing for the profession, we can't just say, well, we were told to do this, we have to take responsibility and accountability.\nMW: No, absolutely, and you shouldn't delegate, you can't delegate to an AI programme your professional or legal responsibilities, absolutely not. And I think that's a really nice point to raise actually. AI can't be held accountable for the mistakes it makes, it's you who's going to be held accountable. So, if you're using AI to make a decision and that turns out to be a bad decision potentially leading to legal action, I'm sorry it's not the AI that's going to go to court it's going to be you. But nevertheless, I mean with the satnav example, the point is what we're doing is we're setting our goal but that AI has helped it and it is AI by the way in a sat nav, it's simple AI but it is AI that's helping us to get there in the, the least painful, most efficient way possible but imagine if that's there everywhere in the world.\nDDS: Yeah completely and the other point I make around satnav, I'm not anti-satnav that would be a very strange position to date, it's understanding that you still have to pay attention but you wouldn't want to work without it.\nMW: Yeah.\nDDS: And finally, if you could leave the profession with one key takeaway regarding the implementation of AI into the workplace what would it be? What would you either want them to you can choose I guess, what would you either want them to do or not do when they're thinking about deployment?\nMW: So, I think when you think about this technology the single most important thing that everybody needs to understand is however smart it appears, it is not a mind like you and me. It is not thinking about what to say, it's not thinking about its response, there is some glorified statistical process that's going on behind the scenes to generate its response, it is not having a conversation with itself about, about how to respond to whatever you want it to do and you shouldn't treat it as if it is a mind, it is not. You should be prepared to dismiss to question and demand further explanation, you have to demand, you have to be ready to question it. I think that's such a crucially important skill,\nDDS: Yeah. I actually managed to get gaslit by AI recently which was quite interesting. So, I asked it to do a graph, it did a graph for me, I asked it to change the axis and it said it couldn't do graphs which then related a long chat where I was like you've just done one and it said well maybe you're thinking about a graph in a different way to me which I thought was interesting. Look, I'd like to thank you so much for giving up your time today and sharing your thoughts on what's a really critical topic for us and it was wonderful to listen to you earlier as well. As always we've got a wealth of practical resources on this available on our website including responsible use of technology and broader updates.\nYou'll see more from us over the coming months as well in this space because we know how critical it is to the profession. There are new episodes of this coming out every fortnight, but this has been a lovely special for us to have catch up on anything that you need on demand, and we look forward to bringing you more like this in the future. So, I'm David D'Souza in Manchester, and this has been the HR People Pod. Thank you very much.\nAre people justified in their resistance of artificial intelligence, or should they accept its power in creating progress in the workplace? Equally, are organisations under too much pressure to act quickly in the face of evolving AI capability?\nIn this special recording of the HR People Pod, CIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Professor Michael Wooldridge, director for AI at Alan Turing Institute and professor of AI at University of Oxford, who suggests, \"all AI programmes are, are glorified pocket calculators\". Addressing that interesting viewpoint and more, we unpack some of the burning questions around AI use in the workplace and within the profession.\nThis episode was recorded live at the CIPD Annual Conference and Exhibition.\nRecorded: 6 November 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 12: Crisis events | Supply chains | Politics at work | 'Ghost jobs'\nDuration: 00:36:46\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza (DDS): Hello and welcome to the HL People Pod. It's the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting business and people practice. If you're listening to this, it's the first recording that we've done live. We've got people walking by us, some people are throwing things. It's a very febrile environment here, but essentially we're piloting this at the CIPD's annual conference. So, we're going out straight after that. My name is David D'Souza. I am Director of Profession at the CIPD and joining me on this special, quite emotional moment are three of the HR's finest. So, I'm going to ask you to introduce yourselves in turn and tell us what you do for a living. So, on my left.\nDavid Bearfield (DB): Hi, my name is David Bearfield and I'm the Director of Human Resources for the United Nations Development Programme, which is the Development Aid part of the United Nations system. We have 22,000 people around the world in 170 plus countries and I'm based in New York.\nDDS: Thanks, David.\nPeter Collyer (PC): I am Peter Collyer. I'm previously Chief People Officer for Ted Baker. I've been a CPO for the last 20 years and this year set myself up as Independent Executive Coach and Consultant.\nBerna Oztinaz (BO): Hello, my name is Berna Oztinaz. I'm the President of the European Association of People Management, also a CHRO of Ghana. And while 25 years in HR and in the Strategic Business Support Functions, currently based in Istanbul, travelling all around Europe to do my job. Thank you.\nDDS: Fantastic. So, a reminder for everyone, the point of the podcast isn't to name and shame organisations, it's to talk about general themes. So, we will talk about three things that are pretty present in the news at the moment and work through them. But just before we get started, just to get to know you a little bit more as people. I've asked you all to think about the tip or the advice that you would give yourself if you were starting your career again now. I'm hoping it's not don't go into the profession and that you're all very satisfied with the choices that you've made.\nDDS: But Berna, if I start with you.\nBO: Well, it's a deep question indeed. Not an easy one indeed.\nDDS: I'm a deep person. I mean, that's what...\nBO: We all know. Well, I think, find the right mentors. So, mentors really do contribute your career and also your personal development, but I would also have told myself that find different mentors for different aspects of your life. Do not stuck with one, but find the right ones to support you, challenge you. So, probably next to calm down a little bit, it would be the advice to myself.\nPC: For me, it links to that actually and it's about hierarchy and I think, I was always taught by my father never to allow hierarchy to get in the way of making progress and never to be afraid of titles and people, and so that served me really well because I would go at very young age go and talk to the most senior people in the room without any concern, always respectfully, always with curiosity but it never held me back and it got me spotted in ways that other people weren't being spotted. So, it was very helpful all the way through my career.\nDB: I think that's great advice and I've probably done the same myself. I completely agree as far as I can say, I gave a talk just last week for a load of early careers people in UNDP and I gave them nine things and I'm only going to maybe pick out one or two. The first is really to be driven by a sense of purpose. So, go in your career with what you really feel passionately, don't follow the money because it's not going to fulfil you. Where you're doing something you know every day, you've got to be passionate about it. You've got to feel you're making a difference and I think that's the kind of motivation that you need to sustain yourself so. For me, working out what your purpose is and following your passion, really, really important. And the second is to be open to opportunities, that's a bit how I didn't have a career plan, I didn't set out to become an HR professional but an opportunity came along and I thought, that's interesting and I took it. And I think it's really important to just be open to what opportunities come and try different things, take a risk.\nDDS: You took that opportunity and regretted it every day since?\nDB: Absolutely sitting here, yes.\nDDS: All of those moments brought you to this desk. I have to say the live format is working well because I've just seen someone nods to something that's been said as they walked by in the background, which is, we're inspiring people far and wide. Coming onto our first topic, and it's a difficult one to talk about because it's genuinely impacting people's lives as we're talking about it. But in the last few weeks, we've seen reports about the devastation caused by flooding in Spain. But it adds to an almost permanent sense of tragedy around the world, it's a very connected world. We get news reports on that wherever we live, but it also has a direct impact on organisations that are involved in really significant things that manifests in a number of ways. It might be because you've got friends and family working in places impacted, you might have suppliers there, parts of your organisation or you might be tasked with supporting in those spaces. So, what should companies need to prepare and how should they respond? And David, it's obviously really close to your heart and the purpose of your organisation. We're going to come to you for a bit of a deep dive first in terms of what you do because it's fascinating but then we'll come to our other two guests to talk about more generally, we're in organisations where it happens to them rather than they're determined or kind of part of the solution what happens there. So, starting with you.\nDB: Yeah well obviously that that's you know goes to the heart of what we do in the United Nations Development Programme. We're, you know we're not doing obviously peacekeeping work or that kind of thing there's lots of colleagues in the United Nations who are very much often in the front line of conflict and sadly some of them do lose their lives every year. But in UNDP, we're everywhere, so that means we're in places where there are active conflicts and we're often there where there are disasters. We help with the recovery and building resilience. So, for example, where you see natural disasters very soon after, we're on the ground trying to help rebuild things. We have people who hundreds of colleagues on the ground in Ukraine, we have people in Gaza, we have people in Sudan, in Haiti. So, very often, very, very difficult situations.\nAnd so, we have a whole established plan to deal with that, to keep people safe. Obviously, we have to take people out on the orders of our security department of the United Nations, where it's too dangerous for people to be. And so, you know, we have policies on rest and recuperation. So, where people are in very, very arduous places that they rotate out every so many weeks so that they can cope. But on another level, obviously, we have people who are living often a long way away from family and friends. We have lots of what we call non-family duty stations where it's safe for people to be, but they can't bring their families because the conditions are too arduous and all of those things cause stresses and strains.\nAnd then just the fact for many people, they're living a long way away from home. And what do you do when, for example, families get sick? And it could be really tough. I had the same situation with my mother who, you know, I was living in New York. My mum was here in the UK with Alzheimer's. How do you manage that kind of situation? We have all these kinds of things. So, we really work really hard to help people. We have our people strategy, people for 2030 and one of the key areas of focus is our duty of care and we've really tried to take that much more seriously to ramp up our efforts. We have counsellors covering each region. They're usually based in the region and they're offering individualised cycle social support to colleagues who are finding it difficult. And we give lots of individual counselling sessions. We give sessions to people in country offices more generally and do everything that we can to try and support people. We now have, since the pandemic, more flexible policies on telecommuting, for example. So, we allow people for periods to go and work, for example, from their home country. So, they're able to, you know, take care of difficult situations that they need, for example, with sick relatives. So, we do a huge amount and this is absolutely going to be part of what we do. It's also part of what people sign up for, but it doesn't make it any easier to cope with.\nDDS: So, that's a fascinating insight into, you know, it happening in real depth. But Peter, Berna, kind of thoughts on what it looks like for an organisation that is possibly more difficult.\nPC: Yeah, well, firstly, I think the CNN's got, people can learn so much, really, from your experiences and expertise. And I think that's part of it. HR is often the gatekeeper when crisis is happening around the world. And, infrequently, you know, the HR functions are not trained. People are not going through rehearsals. They're not understanding the importance of accurate data, accurate reporting, and actually speed of response. I've been advising somebody recently about following the disastrous hurricane Helene and the impact that had with people's flooded properties and demolition of properties. And the HR function was responsible for reporting on it and got the information wrong. It was reported to the board incorrectly. People had lost their homes. People were in crisis. And so, there's a lot of responsibility on what we do as a function within the organisations and I think we can't underestimate the impact on that because it can happen at any moment at any time. And I've also experienced individually in companies the more isolated one-off events. Someone's house burns down, something terrible happens. There's individual crises that we have to respond to with compassion and speed, we've really got to be able to have really clear policy. People need to know who to speak to and make sure that the data we're working with is timely and relevant.\nBO: Well, you have the responsibility of care for people, right? So, I think you need to think even broader nowadays because nothing is off the limits. So, due to the climate changes, political pressures, and unexpected tensions, anything could be knocking your door. So, creating a trust environment and giving your people the confidence that you are there for them is also important. I mean it's as important as what you do after the fact. So, my example of this is when I think about it, I think one of the worst situations was when the earthquake in Turkey, in the east of Turkey, happened. So, people in Istanbul couldn't get sleep for days, they were in panic. Nobody wanted to come to work and we were all asking questions about the building itself. We were having nightmares about the windows being broken. I'm not trying to, you know, create a panic in here. But still, I mean, you need to think about this kind of things through beforehand. And it took a lot of counselling, trainings, and preparation and even sharing the technical information regarding the building's earthquake safety with people.\nAnd also, you need to be ready to take steps, even radical steps. If you think that there is a potential risk that might arise from, you know, something unexpected. I mean, if the building is not good, then find another building. But as HR, you also have the responsibility to trigger this kind of radical decision. But very necessary decisions when the time comes.\nDDS: Yeah, it's that mix, isn't it? And we've had the pandemic. So, we've all had to experience a shared event where people had to do it but they'll keep on happening and having the plan and then being able to vary it, you know, depending on what you need is very different to not having that plan. So, have we got any questions from the floor? We do. Thank you very much. What if you are working with a smaller organisation with more limited resources for things like disaster response. So, if you're working SME or you're working MCAT rather than the UN, what should you be doing? What should you be planning?\nPC: Yeah, I guess you'd be connecting with the charities that are in that space to be able to support you. Still going to be limited impact. But at least you'll be talking to some experts who can provide some direction and input, I think, that's the initial thing that comes to mind for me.\nBO: Create your own experts, invest in your people to get some trainings. And, you know, to be responsible from some of the emergency actions, I think it helps. Work with NGOs. NGOs are offering really good help, support. So, they are with you, they could be with you to support you. And invite your employees in to take more accountabilities and, of course, support them.\nDDS: Yeah. And I think I can speak in this bit, can't I? Because I'm not just interviewing guests. I think the other thing is just lean on the profession. So, for most problems, someone else has had to solve that prior. So, approach an organisation a bit bigger than you, ask for their templates, for their plans and then don't be afraid to kind of work from that and go, this wouldn't work for us, that would need adjusting. But at least you're not staring at a blank piece of paper going, where do I start from here? Use our community for that as well. We've got a really strong one. That's the kind of thing you should be popping up and going, Can anyone share? Can anyone help me out?\nI'm going to move on a little bit now to talking about supply chains in organisations. So, there's been some recent investigations given media coverage, which has, again, shone a light on low standards, particularly in the fashion industry. But it's not exclusive to that around the way that people are treated further down the supply chain, where it's maybe less visible to customers or to organisations commissioning from them. So, is there an ethical obligation for organisations do you think about their supply chain as well as a legal obligation? And what role, if any, does the people profession have to play in that directly? So, where that, where we're trying to aspire for better work, that should be better work for all rather than better work for the people that are just in our eye line. Peter, I can see you've taken the mic.\nPC: Yes, well, no, not necessarily. But we've seen Panorama. I've been involved in some of the Panorama programmes over the years where they've been, you know, accusations of child labour and other factors happening through the supply chain, fashion is renowned for it we know. So, I think, firstly, it comes down to clarity of purpose and I hate to say it, but the policy and the approach is really critical here. People who are not policy-driven, we have to have real clarity on what we stand for in writing so it can be interpreted and translated accordingly. I think checks and processes are absolutely key. You don't know that you're passing out through the supply chain, that the contractors are not subcontracting which is what happens so many times. The company is not even aware that it's happening and it's being subcontracted often to family members out in those territories where fast fashion is being created. So, we know that that happens. There has to be a great network amongst the community. I can talk for retail and in retail itself, if we understand there are certain practices happening in Turkey, Portugal, Leicester, you know, there's things all over the world. There's a great network. We will call each other as other retailers and say we've got something we're not sure about here. Then we'll make the visits and then we'll go and audit what's going on. It's really critical that once you've got an action plan in place, you don't have a knee-jerk reaction to something that's happening.\nBecause there was one business I was working with where there was a child labour issue. Several of the board members believed immediately we should withdraw from that country our production and that would have been absolutely the wrong thing to have done because those children would have been another form of labour which could have been far more damaging to those children. We picked up the costs for those children's education for the next three years. So, we made some proper decisions as to how to deal with the situation, course correct it and put processes in place so that it didn't happen again. So, you can't treat these things lightly, but we all have a responsibility to keep an eye open for it.\nBO: I agree, all of those and I think the communication of your policy about this is really critical and inside out. I mean, we all have our policies about these kind of issues but I think it should be communicated to the external world in a very clear manner. And I think, I know that it is not the most popular way to collect information but I think your whistleblower lines should be open to receive those kinds of tips as well. And again, the communication of this with the outer world is important. So, people need to know the way that they can reach you but I also think that it's an important decision and critical decision for a company to make. Because when you start to receive the tips, then you need to have the resources and commitment to go through them and make the necessary investigations and take the actions. So, you need to get real about it. So, it is not a pretending job.\nDDS: Any thoughts on that, David? Or should we move on?\nDB: Well, we obviously don't have supply chains. We don't make things. But in UNDP, we probably come at this from a different angle because as the UN's leading development agency, we are really making a huge contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals 2030. And so, we are trying to encourage the right practices around the world to lift people out of poverty, to build sustainability into supply chains and everything we do. So, we really work towards that but obviously we are coming at it from a different angle than the more commercial one.\nDDS: On supply chain specifically, how much is the management of that within the remit of HR, the people profession? So, it is obviously a broader business issue but to what extent should the profession be working towards that?\nBO: I think it's very much related with how you define HR's role. And I think for HR, one of the aspects of now and future HR is being the shepherd of the ESG issues and governance issues and social issues and environment issues. So, I think HR should not lock itself into traditional roles. We have been listening for two days. Isn't it? I mean, what is expected from HR in the future? So, the role is expanding. I think we are the shepherds and gatekeepers for this kind of ethical issues in the organisation.\nPC: Yeah, I would add to that. I guess in one of the organisations, I was also responsible for the ESG group, the function. So, ethics and sustainability and it was a perfect partnership with HR. Because if you are caring about people, you are caring about all those different aspects. If you tie it into the SDGs as well from a people planet perspective, it can be really, really powerful. I think you have to have clarity on where the boundaries are and often it is during the intersection where something gets handed over from HR to the ESG group or health and safety or facilities. Whoever is looking after different components, that is where things fall through the net. And I think you have to really look at the workflows and processes and test it, you know. It works well.\nDDS: You made a really interesting point earlier which is around principles but also policy and having one manifest in the other. And I think there is a lot of talk quite often that does policy down? You are never going to solve it just through policy but actually anchoring stuff, being really clear on where it happens, who is accountable for it, what steps you will take if something happens. It is a really important thing to do to get people clear and stop things falling through gaps.\nPC: Yeah, I think comms is so important, the whole communication process throughout the entire. From top to bottom in the organisation. One of the models that I found very useful over the years is the think, feel, do approach in any communication that is going out. So, what do we want the audience that is receiving this to think, feel and do as a result? You know, you can't always control that. But you can have an intention as to what you are looking for and you have to question that as an organisation and really assess it. I think the other thing is major projects, major things that are being launched. I am a big fan of pre-mortems. So, post-mortem is too late. You do it when someone is dead. There is nothing you can find other than what is the cause of death. A pre-mortem is before you launch a project. You tear something apart. Really critique it to understand where you need to fine-tune how this project is being launched or a communication. Whatever it is. Transformation project. Really critique it and go through it in a way that will enable you to really fine-tune some of the things that you can prevent from going wrong and it creates a much more successful output.\nDDS: So, for anyone who hasn't done one of those, essentially what you are asking is, if this fails, what would have happened? Because that is not often the question that you ask at the start of something. You go, what do we need to do to succeed? If it fails, what does it happen? We didn't get the comms through. Okay, so what do we need to do about that? Or actually, we didn't have the technology through it. So, what do we need to do about that? Just a really nice different lens. So, brilliant practical tip. Next up, we are tackling a timely and sensitive topic. How should companies handle political talk at work, if at all? So, we have had the US elections recently which has been taken up front pages. Highly controversial and at times very adversarial but that's the first of a number of topics that we know in workplaces causing active discussion or occasionally conflict. So, what role should the profession play in moderating discussions, enabling discussions, preventing discussions? Because there is an active choice to be made around what blend of those three things that we do.\nBO: Well, this is a very difficult subject. I mean, we're humans and we have our values, opinions, of course and the places that we work, the offices, wherever we work, they are not somewhere out of your life. It is a part of your life. So, you need to feel comfortable in your skin, in your workplace as well. But there are things that you could moderate a discussion around.\nBut there are things that you cannot moderate a discussion around. What's happening in Israel and Gaza is not a topic that you could moderate. You don't have the expertise to moderate a discussion around. So, I think as HR, all the leaders of the company, we need to also know our capabilities and limits of our capabilities. As long as people are respectful to each other's opinion and values. I think discussions cannot be prevented. Or, you know, voicing our opinions cannot be prevented but I don't think that we need to put ourselves into a position to moderate any kind of political debates, discussions.\nDB: I think you've made a very strong point there, Berna. And, you know, obviously, coming at this from the point of view of the United Nations Development Programme, the UN more generally, at one level, you know, we are held to very high ethical standards and being absolutely impartial is really, really important. So, you know, we have very strict rules about that. We're not allowed to express any kind of political opinion, you know, privately. You know, not even to click like on political Facebook posts. We have to remain strictly neutral, strictly impartial at all times which, of course, sometimes I think people, an individual level can find difficult. But that's part of what you sign up to with the UN but when you get down to the level of kind of the office and, you know, my team are, you know, plus, minus 100 people. We have people from every continent, we have people from all main religious backgrounds, different political views. You know, and I started there six and a half years ago. And I thought, how is this in reality? You know, you have 194 nationalities all working together, very, very different people, different backgrounds, different experiences. And actually, I found that this kind of requirement in a way for impartiality turns into a culture of deep mutual respect of each other at work and I just don't see any conflicts or heated discussions about that, people I think, all understand we leave our personal views at the door and focus on what we're doing. People might have a discussion at the water cooler over lunch, whatever but it's always in a very respectful way. And I think, you know, your choice of the word respectful is really important because once you start going in one particular direction, it's very hard to say you can talk about this subject but not that subject.\nDB: So, it actually, it works really well and I'm just amazed that, I mean, it sounds a bit cheesy, but it does give me a lot of hope when I see how we work in UNDP that people, you know, everyone has a deep sense of shared purpose. We put your views to one side to serve that and people just get on. You know, even if you have people at work who come from countries on different sides, you know, of a conflict that might be going on. It just seems to work and I think that's a great thing to see, it does give me some hope, as I said, that, you know, people are people and we can, when we're focused on a joint goal, we can just get on with each other.\nDDS: It's quite interesting, isn't it? So, there's that recognition that if I recognise you as an individual, that means you need to recognise and respect other individuals.\nDB: Exactly.\nDDS: Rather than just being a, I have a right to express. It's actually, look, we need to find a way to be good together.\nDB: Yeah.\nPC: I had, for 20 years, I had a plaque on my wall that said, offence is rarely intended but frequently taken. And it was, it's nothing is so true, you know and it's helped me and actually my functions that I've built over the years in HR to think with that mindset, that what you're communicating, how you're communicating, and how you're dealing with it, there's always other perspectives and it doesn't mean your version of the truth is at 100%, you know. There are other versions of the truth. So, I think that's really important, there's one example, though, where I was working for an organisation with 5,000 millennials, Gen Z, X, Ys, etc., through the Brexit process. And we'd always come from the philosophy that, you know, politics and religion has no place in work conversation. It has a place but you can deal with all of that outside of being productive in the workplace. And we kind of reached a point through that really painful process that said, what are we doing? You know, this is, this decision about Brexit is impacting the future decades for this generation. Why shouldn't we be talking about it more and allowing that dialogue? So, to Berna's point about the topic being appropriate, if it's appropriate, drop the boundaries.\nBut make sure you're clear about why they're being dropped on this occasion. But we really opened up discussion and dialogue that people needed to understand process and just debate what was happening and what the implications were. It was out of their control, largely, because decisions had already been made but it helped people through the process.\nDDS: I think I like your comment, if I can just butt in about offence, because I think it's very easy to take offence. For me, I try and kind of always think about the principle of what's the person's intention. Because most people are actually not setting out to deliberately cause offence. I think it's really important to see what's the intentionality behind it and I think if people think about that a bit more, you know, people would find it much easier to get along and respect each other's views. I can see you're grabbing the mic there, Berna.\nBO: Well, yes.\nDDS: I hope you're not offended.\nBO: No, no, no. Not at all. No, I was going to support you. The thing is that, well, it's very much related with your real values, isn't it? I mean, again, what are the genuine values of your company, your organisations? Because it is not specific to a political debate, but it is about how you work together, how you live together in the workplace. So, I mean, if you are able to embed respect. If it is one of your company values or embracing diversity, if it is a company value, and if it is really genuinely there, then everything works out.\nDDS: There's a really interesting thing around company values, and we will move on, which is I think you can require and expect people to behave in a certain way, congruent with your values. You can't expect them at all to think the same way. And I think it's really easy to trip and make that mistake and go, everyone around here thinks the same way, That's probably not a healthy.\nBO: I mean, I cannot agree more. I think when you are calling for the things that you wanted to happen in your company values, also, you need to be brave enough to make it clear that what is not acceptable. And it's not an easy job all the time.\nDDS: I mean, I have to say the main bit that I've taken away from this section, because I think it has been quite profound and deep, is that Peter had a plaque. That's quite fancy. Plaque. Can I just say, David, do you have a plaque?\nDB: No. I do have a thing on my wall, though. It's not a plaque. It's a piece of paper, because my youngest son, when he was growing up, must have heard me coming home, kind of exasperated, you know, frequently at work. And so, for Christmas a few years ago, he gave me this thing he printed out nicely, and it said, how difficult can it be? And I have that on my wall in my office.\nDDS: I like that. I like that.\nDB: I guess I must have said that a lot of times when I got home.\nDDS: I mean, we talked about mentors earlier, actually. My first mentor, who, in a really strange turn of events, only agreed to be my mentor if I shaved my beard off, which I did for long enough for him to agree to it, and then I grew it back. But active, petty defiance.\nBO: Might not be the right mentor, maybe?\nDB: Possibly not.\nDDS: But he had a lovely saying, which was a cold assessment of the facts. Warm development of behaviour. So, see things as they are, but then work through them in a way that's compassionate with people and I'll be getting that on a plaque. I think that's the way forward.\nDB: We should all have a plaque.\nDDS: Sounds like a good idea. Have one made immediately. Finally, regular listeners of the show will know we have an ongoing segment where we say, is it a thing? So, we take something from the media. It might be TikTok. It might be a headline in a tabloid newspaper where it talks about an emerging trend that may or may not actually be a thing. So, this week's buzzword is ghost jobs which is not jobs for actual ghosts that would be a weird thing but it is a report that revealed that nearly 40% of organisations are advertising positions that don't actually exist. So, it doesn't stop there, some businesses are even conducting fake interviews for roles that they never intended to fill. I imagine they're then paying those people fake money to do fake work. Why would organisations do this? Have you ever done it? As professionals. Is it a thing? Peter, I'm going to start with you. Because you'll start with the microphone.\nPC: No, I haven't done it like that. I mean, we've kind of posted positions for the future. Talent pipelining for the future, there's nothing wrong in saying we are planning ahead and posting opportunities and skill sets that you're looking for. Capabilities that you want to assess the market see what's out there and identify people that you might connect with 12, 15 months from now. But as long as you're transparent and open about that at the outset, you know what you're in.\nDDS: So, when you're advertising that, it would say on the advert.\nPC: Future Talent Pipeline Development or something along those lines and so, people know what they're doing and you have a really authentic conversation at the interview. There's nothing wrong with that, I think, that's all good news but I've never experienced anything like that. I was shocked by the 40% statistic that it happens.\nDB: Who has time to post fake jobs? I mean, we have enough trouble processing the ones that we actually have. I mean, I think it's really unethical as well and how is that going to actually affect your employer brand? Because people talk. I mean, that's just not very consistent. Why would people want to go and work for an organisation that's prepared just to waste people's time? And indeed, the company or the organisation's time. So, we wouldn't do it but we certainly just don't have time to engage in that. That kind of thing.\nDDS: Can you imagine talking to a recruitment team? And they go, we're so busy, we've got 10,000 vacancies on the go. And you go, but we don't have 10,000 jobs and they go, yeah, that's why we're busy, we've been making them up, we've been advertising them anyway. Berna?\nBO: No, I mean, to tell you the truth, I didn't know about this. So, then I tried to educate myself why an organisation on Earth can do such a thing. But, well, there are reasons, reasons like you're trying to prove that you're an up and running business, growing business, or sometimes there are organisations who can think that, I mean, they need to show their employees that they are replaceable. I can't say that I like this kind of mind setting. But still, I mean, those are the reasons, I guess and, of course, creating a pipeline. Because you don't know whenever that you will need them. I mean, nobody can say that this is a good way of planning. So, I never had those kind of resources about fantasies. But I think, yes, this is not ethical and it shouldn't be acceptable. I can't think of a good reason for job ghosting. Maybe I have limited imagination. I don't know.\nDDS: So, I just want to pick up on one of the things you dropped in the middle, that one of the reasons you might do it is to scare someone that their job is under threat.\nBO: Yeah, I read it then. I mean, we were talking about it with our VP in the European Association this morning and he said that it was on papers in Belgium last week. So, apparently, it's a thing. I mean,\nDDS: I'm not offering this as a top tip to the audience.\nBO: Don't do it.\nDDS: But there's a level of cunning there that I'm actually quite impressed by.\nDB: It's more of a what not to do, though, isn't it, really? I mean, you know, it doesn't make any sense and if you want to manage people's performance, I think there are better ways to do it than ghost jobs, frankly.\nDDS: I'm going to go Google my job after this and just check that it's not being advertised currently.\nDB: Going to get my phone out immediately.\nDDS: Look, that's all from us today. I'd like to thank our guests, Peter, Berna, and David, for sharing their thoughts and being so open and coping with people waving at them as they go past as well. It's been a new and exciting experience. We've got a wealth of resources available to support people in all of these spaces and more coming. So, please do keep a lookout for your communications from us, this was described as the best podcast that someone's listened to by someone who was attempting to get an invitation on this to sell to us recently. I still can't get my wife to listen to it, but one day I'm sure she will put up with my voice for a bit longer.\nDB: Advertise her job and stand by motorway.\nDDS: I'm going to put it on a plaque, that's the way to go. So, yeah, the Create Your Own Plaque campaign started here today. Monumental. Please do catch up on demand. You've already found the podcast because you're listening to it, but it's available on all the main platforms. I'm David D'Souza, and this has been the CIPD's HR People Pod. Thank you very much.\nHow prepared is your organisation to support employees through a crisis event? Can employers ensure their supply chains are fully ethical? Should politics and work ever mix? And what's behind the spooky rise of 'ghost jobs'?\nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by David Bearfield, Director of the Office of Human Resources at the United Nations Development Programme; Berna Oztinaz, President of the European Association of People Management and CHRO at Genel Energy Plc; and Pete Collyer, consultant and former Chief People Officer at Ted Baker.\nThis episode was recorded live at the CIPD Annual Conference and Exhibition.\nRecorded 7 November 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 11: Workplace Wellbeing | Real Living Wage | 'Fauxducitivity'\nDuration: 00:30:32\nTranscript\nAmanda Arrowsmith: Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting the people profession and the world of work. I am not David D'Souza, as you may have noticed, I'm Amanda Arrowsmith, the People and Transformation Director at the CIPD sitting in for David for this week's episode and joining me.\nDavid Blackburn: It's David Blackburn. I'm very glad it's you, Amanda, because it's always very annoying when there's two Davids in the room. I'm David Blackburn. I'm the Managing Director of David R. Blackburn Consulting Limited and I'm a Charter Companion of the CIPD.\nAA: Thanks, David. Welcome.\nElizabeth Harvey: Hi. No, thanks for having me. So, I'm Elizabeth Harvey, I'm head of HR at HSBC for the UK functions, and I'm delighted to join you.\nAA: Thanks so much for being here. It's a pleasure to have you both join the show, and my first one hosting, so I appreciate it. Be gentle with me. So, before we get into the details, I'd like to hear a bit more about you. So, perhaps you could tell me something that you've been reading, watching, been up to recently. David, you want to start?\nDB: Yes. So, I was delighted that season 2 of \"Pachinko\" has just gone live on Apple TV. If you don't know it, \"Pachinko\" is an amazing novel about a long, it's a long saga, of a single family, a single woman's journey. And it's set in South Korea and Japan. And when I read the novel, I knew nothing about that history, that time of, part of the world and it's been serialised and it's incredible.\nAA: And so go back and watch the first series?\nDB: Go back and watch the first series. Yes, because otherwise it won't make sense. So yes, there's a linear journey of one individual, the main female character. And how she traverses her own journey, her family journey during a really turbulent period of Japan's invasion of South Korea. And she goes to live in Japan. It's amazing. You, there are episodes that are so incredibly emotional you'll be in floods. Well, I was certainly in floods. I mean, floods, I cry at a lot of things, but that really, it's a real emotional roller coaster but it's brilliantly written and beautifully filmed.\nAA: Fantastic. Thank you. Elizabeth, what have you been up to?\nEH: So, I'd say I'm not as sophisticated because I'm definitely watching \"Married at First Sight\".\nAA: Oh, yeah.\nEH: Which just gives me a bit of a kind of a brain rest. But otherwise, I'm currently on a programme called \"Solaris\", which is a female leadership development programme and we have an amazing powerhouse, Yetunde Hofmann, and she has a book called \"Beyond Engagement\", which is all about love-based leadership. So, you know, what would happen to the world? What would business? What would it be like in the workplace if we had the premise of love as a starting place. So, it's a really powerful book, which I'd encourage you all to pick up. And she's an amazing leader, I must say, a privilege to kind of engage with her on a one-to-one basis as well.\nAA: Yeah, she is.\nDB: She is.\nAA: I think we can all agree that Yetunde is definitely a powerhouse. I've been doing my homework ahead of ACE, so it's our annual conference and exhibition in November. So, I've been doing my homework. And I've got the pleasure of hosting one of our keynotes, which is Bruce Daisley. So, I've been rereading some of his books and some of his works, but also, I've been listening to his podcast and just kind of getting there. So, it's \"Eat, sleep, work, repeat\" and I've been getting into that again, just to get myself prepared for meeting with Bruce in Manchester and I hope we'll see lots of you there. Before we move into our first topics, I just want to give everyone what might be a really timely reminder, is that on October the 26th, employers have a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of employees and workers in the course of their employment. Whilst we're not going to be talking about that today, I think it's really important just to remind people that's coming in, if you haven't prepared for it, you should be preparing for it. So, we want to make sure people are thinking about that and perhaps listen to one of our previous podcasts where we talked about what employers could do and how that might work? OK, then let's get into our first topic of discussion. Over the past fortnight, we've seen a number of headlines around the theme of workplace well-being. We've heard for calls to increase statutory sick pay and have seen reports around proposals to trial weight-loss jabs as a way to tackle worklessness and just recently have observed \"Menopause Awareness Day\". I'm sure we've got opinions on all those headlines, but that's not what we're going to open our discussion about. I want to pick up on a headline stemming from a study conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health that reports that half of UK workforce lacks access to reliable workplace health support. This includes things like winter flu vaccinations and checks for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the Institute for Public Policy Research made the headlines this week when it suggested that employers who failed to provide healthy work environments for their staff, such as subsidised nutritious food, should face regulatory action, including fines and public censure. So, let's start with, \"what is an employer's responsibility and where is the line around that?\" David, do you want to kick us off?\nDB: Well, I think this is not a new topic and we've been talking about what constitutes a healthy workplace for at least the last, you know, 15 years, if not longer. And I think that the balance of around what are you, the employee as an individual accountable for versus what is the employer accountable for? I think is a line that has been constantly moving and shifting, especially post the pandemic. And whilst the idea, very often the idea is a great one. Why would we not want all environments to be a healthy working environment? Everyone's going to sign up to that and going to say \"yes\". I think those things are only possible if we have the right investment in the infrastructure that sits behind it. So, when we make policy decisions or the government makes policy announcements, then it's backed up by the right skills and supports because employers simply can't do all of it themselves. The example you know I'd give is that investment in occupational health and we were talking about it before we sat down in the studio, is the fact that, you know, back in 2010, you know, the Fit Note Revolution was supposed to be supported by a whole investment in occupational health. That actually the ability to have meaningful conversation about what an employee could do versus what they couldn't do. All of that great, again great idea, was not backed up by the required investment. So, actually what we have today is a system that doesn't work and that recently we were talking about you know, are we in \"sick note culture\" and all that sort of thing. So, I think where the accountability sits, most organisations that observation about the meals for example. I mean, in many organisations that just would not be feasible. I mean it would not be financially viable; it wouldn't be possible. And I think that we shouldn't be, rather than trying to treat the symptoms, which very often we are in this space, \"let's have a fruit bowl\", \"let's have massages\". \"Let's have\" well don't get me on my pole well-being on now, what does well-being look like? But you know, so actually we'll do all of that stuff. Actually, we'd be better off focusing on what are the root causes of employee illness, sickness, absence, all of that sort of stuff. So, I just think we've got to, there is a responsibility and accountability for employers, but I think defining what that is, the devil is in the detail, and I think it can't just be more for the employers to do.\nAA: Where are you coming from on this, Elizabeth?\nEH: So, it's a massively important topic and we've seen so much change in the last couple of years. You know apps like Headspace and so on. But I think employees also have a choice. You know, they have a choice to make, and you've seen organisations who offer unlimited holiday. You then find that they're having to force or push colleagues to take extra holiday because they haven't even taken the statutory minimum. So, that employee choice also comes into this. And, as we were talking, there's something around the parent-child relationship, and so where does the burden really lie? And on the employer, there is only so much that certain organisations can do and you'll have, you know, huge organisations who, from a total compensation perspective, they can do private medical, they can do group income protection, you know, they can do additional pay in terms of sickness and you name it, and there's so much in that. Whereas smaller organisations aren't able to access this. They're not able to do so for their employee. The institute talks about, you know, kind of an FCA-like regulation and so consumer duty comes to mind about, you know, the need to not do harm to colleagues. But I think it's putting too much burden on business, on the employer versus actually how do we understand what colleagues and employees really want and where can the government also play in these spaces, rather than trying to push it across to the right.\nAA: I worry a little bit about the potential impact on people who aren't considered to be the normal healthy. So, you know if you've got someone who's perhaps a little bit overweight or you've got someone who has a disability or someone has a physical impairment, this push for workplace well-being and this health requirement, what does that do for us as employers? And I'm really interested in where you think we draw the line and what we can and can't do.\nDB: I think that's a really good observation, Amanda, and it links back to what Alison was saying about you know, what's the employee and the employer's responsibility around health, because health is intrinsically something really quite personal.\nAA: Yeah.\nDB: And will be, and to your point, will be very different for different individuals at different life stages. And if you think about the journey that organisations have been on and we've been on in society, \"Menopause Awareness Day\" that you've just been talking about. That didn't exist 10 years ago, and we understand neurodivergence in a way that is different. We understand long-term health conditions in a way that is different in a long COVID, post the pandemic. So, I think that there's a huge amount of nuance to this and I think there's often, the response sometimes is a very binary response. Alison's observation about, you know that they're, what they're suggesting, a sort of because in my head, I'm 10 years in the financial services sector, \"Yes\", I thought, \"well, it's a bit like the consumer duty, isn't it?\" But the minute you start getting into that sort of space that says I'm going to regulate this thing; I'm going to fine you if you're not. I just think that, you know, that's a sort of one-size-fits-all idea. I don't even know what that framework would look like and how would you apply it to the host of SMEs, for example, that make up such a huge part of the workforce in the UK economy. You know, they've got lots of other stuff to be getting on with and thinking about. It's not that having a healthy workplace isn't important. We all absolutely agreed about that. But how you go about achieving that, I'm not sure fining people is the right answer.\nAA: So, Elizabeth, what does a healthy workplace look like?\nEH: So, a healthy workplace really needs to have a baseline of trust. So, I think you could have all the benefits in the world. You could have all the different factors, you know, health checks, you name it, that pick up things kind of proactively, as you talked about, David. But really, you know health is so personal, to your point that I have to be able to share that with my line manager or with my organisation. So, when we talk about well-being, I think the premise of trust or psychological safety to allow you to speak up. So, you know, \"I'm not feeling too well today\" or \"I'm going to take this time off\" without any unintended consequences, that's really important. And also, I think, being able for colleagues to come together and share their opinions. So, you know we talked about, is it healthy nutritious meals at a good cost price? Well, can we talk about that? Can we be part of the decisions that are made for the rest of the organisation? How do you kind of collectively come together to make sure we're providing the right support for the colleagues in that organisation?\nAA: I love that idea, because that also comes back to that inclusion point, because it's great if you want to do a team competition around a walk. So, let's all walk the, you know, the Great Wall of China, I did once in one organisation where all the team walked it. But we needed to find a way to make that inclusive. So, how do you do that for people who perhaps can't walk, who can't do exercise, who can't do physical things? And having that employee involvement, I think, is a real opportunity to support that. Have you got any suggestions or tips that you'd say if you're going to, say into an organisation, what's the one thing you'd like to see people do?\nEH: I think there are definitely things that are getting more standardised around health checks and even some kind of the meal provisions around a vegan week, vegetarian week, just variety of cultures and so on. Whereas you can taste things maybe on a basis to improve your whole lifestyle. So, things that you can introduce in the workplace that might just tip someone to do something more holistically for their lifestyle and their families, I think, are really important to change well-being.\nAA: Yeah, I like that. David, anything from you?\nDB: I think Elizabeth is right. I think it's the small, nudgy things that you can do, which sometimes isn't about a health check or I think, it's just about a conversation, so creating a space where actually you're making that front of mind for colleagues, so that actually they're thinking about it. So, then that might make them go away and take individual accountability for doing something. So, yeah, I agree. I think the more we have a conversation about why it is important and how we can support you, but without that necessarily being, \"here's a fruit basket\", yeah.\nAA: Yeah. I think the one practical thing. I love our fruit basket.\nDB: I mean, I love a fruit basket.\nAA: The one practical thing that I would suggest is, there is something you can sign up to called \"Time to Test\". Which just encourages employers to give people time off to go to the health checks that they're asked to go to.\nDB: Ah, that's good.\nAA:  So, if you as a woman, are asked to go for a smear test, that's generally during the working day. Give people time to test, don't make them take holiday to have those health checks that actually are going to be preventative medicine and help them in the future and those sort of things. I want to move on and talk about how, earlier this week, the new Real Living Wage rates were announced, seeing a 5%, 60 pence increase to PS12.60 per hour across the UK and 5.3 percent or a 70% increase to PS13.85 in London. In the CIPD's labour market outlook in summer 2024, we explored employers' approaches to the voluntary Real Living Wage, with accredited employers citing it as fair or the right thing to do and opting into the recommended wage rate can improve employee financial well-being as core reason to commit to paying the wage. Of course, we also are aware that there are a number of employers who are not officially accredited but choose to pay workers at or above the voluntary living wage. But even with that, 25% of employers across large and small organisations have no intention to increase their minimum pay rate to match or exceed the voluntary living wage, and there's a wide range of reasons for that, cost being one. But I want to open up the conversation a bit around your thoughts on the Real Living Wage and particularly how that might impact, and what those employers that can't afford to do it, could do. Elizabeth, do you want to start us off?\nEH: I am a complete advocate, Amanda, I would say you know. The Living Wage Foundation, it's fantastic to see the movement that they've created across such a huge spectrum of employers. I think they have something like 15,000 employers that are now signed on and you know some of those employee benefits that are then seen around productivity, recruitment, even investment, coming back into those industries. So, there is something that is right there and I love what you shared around the fact that it is the right thing to do, albeit it can be hard for every type of organisation to do so. And you know your larger organisation will easily be able to say, \"Yeah. Sign up here\" or even if they haven't signed up, you know they know that their pay is a premium to that living wage. Small organisations, entrepreneurs that are hiring a few people, you know, how can they afford to do that? I think this is where the government also needs to kind of support and build some infrastructure around this. And I know there's conversations around the Minimum Wage, whether that should move towards being the Real Living Wage. And that will be really hard for those industries, and I suppose there is a tipping point here. We're seeing mass unemployment in the market and we're seeing the number of vacancies decrease. LinkedIn talked about the fact that, you know, suddenly we'll see a huge shift and we'll see colleagues kind of just moving around jobs as the market starts to pick up. So, whilst it's great for bigger organisations who can build in that infrastructure, some of those smaller organisations, they're going to need support. And, you know, whether it's the government, whether it's larger organisations leaning in to help others out to try and make sure that, you know from an economics perspective, you know we're able to have spare money to spend, you know, build the UK economy. There's something there that needs to kind of shift.\nAA: Thanks. David, where are you on this?\nDB: Yeah, I mean, like Elizabeth, I'm an absolute advocate and have been a Real Living Wage, you know, Foundation supporter and member in all of the organisations that I've worked in, probably for the last decade. How long has the Real Living Wage Foundation been going? Probably as long as that, I think would be my guess. I think that the challenge, as you've both mentioned, is not just by size and scale of organisation, but it's also within sectors and, you know, earlier this year you know I spent six months as the Interim Executive Director of People at Mencap, the Royal Mencap Society. It's one of the largest charities in the UK, you know, it employs 8,000 people, about 90% of the workforce are paid the National Minimum Wage, and that's because that's what the charity can afford, and doing, really support workers do incredibly valuable, important, complex, often very complex roles, supporting adults with learning disabilities with complex needs. And a bit like the conversation we were having earlier about, you know, are we treating the symptom, or are we treating the root cause? I agree the journey surely must be from Minimum Wage towards the Real Living Wage. You know, that should be an aspiration. If that's the aspiration, then I think the question is how is that achievable? And exactly as Elizabeth said, is that businesses supporting other businesses and how do we do that? But also, I think that you know there is a fundamental debate and I'm really delighted that you know the new government want to have that debate about social care as a sector. And pay rates and is it aligned to the NHS? And all of that good stuff. I think that's massively important. So, actually I am a huge advocate and a supporter. It's just not feasible, financially viable, even for big organisations in the charity sector. And, you know, within social care. But it should be. And I think, how we answer that question, I think is really, really important.\nAA: Yeah. So, it's that financial reality of how you can support people, particularly the risk of the working poor, which we know is increasing. We're seeing that increase, aren't we? We talked earlier, before we came in, about the increased use in foodbanks and how that supports. And it it's where the employer fits within that and how you support your employees, which almost comes back to what we talked about \"healthy\" and that kind of that place of having a healthy workplace of how you can support employees around that. I'm not, I don't know the answer. I'm not sure what any of you would say.\nDB: No, I mean, Amanda, that's a really good point, isn't it about, you know, the thing that always strikes me is, and someone I'm sure will correct me if I'm wrong. So, I think we're the fifth largest economy in the world. We're in the G7, so we're either fifth or sixth, and there's a lot of money in UK PLC. There just is. Now, I'm not a Marxist, I'm not saying suddenly we should be, but there is something, isn't there just about the way in which what does a healthy, forget healthy workplace, what does a healthy, balanced society look like? How are we closing the gap, which we know has widened, significantly widened over the last decade? We know that the pandemic has had a massive effect. We know there's been a cost-of-living crisis, but actually it has disproportionately affected particular groups, particular areas, particular geographies. How do we focus on, you know, having a sensible conversation about rebalancing some of that, I think.\nAA: It's that guaranteed minimum income-type approach, maybe, which I think one of the Nordic countries have had, haven't they.\nDB: They have, Finland. Finland and it's and it's worked I mean, because it's one of my soapbox subjects about the Scandinavian, you know. So, actually every single year, consistently when they rate the top places to live in the world, the Scandinavian nations come in the top ten, if not in the top five. They have a base rate of tax that's over 40 percent, 45%. There is a deal that we haven't quite got our heads around in Britain. You know, all of the coverage right now about the upcoming, you know, October budget is, \"Oh my God! They're going to put taxes up\" Oh my God\" They're going to put taxes up!\" and at the same time we're expecting world-class NHS services. Well, they, these two things are completely connected with each other. Unless, and what the thing that the Scandinavians have, over generations, post the Second World War got their heads around is saying, \"well, we pay for it\", we make this investment in order so that, actually, the quality of our public services is really good. And I just think we, no government in Britain wants to have that dialogue. I'd hope that with the new government, with a big majority, maybe we could start having some of these more challenging conversations about, and I don't think it's just individuals. I mean business, exactly as Elizabeth says, businesses. I'll get off my soapbox now.\nEH: I might join you on the soapbox, to be honest.\nDB: Come on, there's lots of room.\nEH: I think some of the, some of the stats that you can see are quite stark for me. You know, teachers having to come out and say, \"I have to buy breakfast bars so that some of these children are able, to kind of have something in their stomachs to be able to focus on learning\". Lots of numbers around, people having to skip meals or even foodbanks saying, \"Potatoes get left\". You know, \"Pasta gets left in boxes because people can't afford the gas and electricity to cook these meals at home\". And so, the government's doing some great things around, you know, breakfast clubs, oh, we're going to introduce breakfast clubs to make sure that our, you know, our future of this country is fed and equipped and they're going to be able to learn. But the balance somewhat is, is slightly missing. And I don't think the onus is only on business. I think it's collective, to try and do something to really kind of boost the economy and make sure that, you know, our people are looked after. That, I think I got into a rabbit hole on YouTube and there's something called like \"Britain's worst\" and it's everything you can imagine. \"Britain's worst\", you know, towns or poorest towns. And to be honest, there are parts of this country that have just been left. There's no investment, there's no jobs. And I think, as we look at in employment rates shifting and then if you overlay where they sit jurisdictionally, there are some really big challenges to be faced where I do think business and the government coming together could really kind of, you know, work to fix some of this.\nAA: Yeah, that collective responsibility thing is really interesting, isn't it? And that rise of the working poor, I think, is a real risk. We all know that we've seen a massive rise in foodbanks and how that works. And unfortunately, you know, as I've mentioned previously, we can't rely on Taylor Swift.\nDB: Yeah.\nAA: To keep coming in and bailing out the foodbanks. So, I think, I know that we've, always in our village we do a Christmas Foodbank and it feels little just doing that once a year, but it's good to bring things together and you know, if you can help your local foodbank, either as your employer or as your society, there's, it is that collective and how we do things as a society. Thank you. I feel hopeful. I feel like we're, I like this soapbox. I think actually there'll be a lot of people, it might have to be a soap platform or something bigger.\nEH: We can build it.\nAA: If you build it, they will come, is that it? Yeah. So, on this podcast, we like to talk about something that we hear being talked about and coming about. It's a bit of a familiar segment, which is, \"Is It a Thing?\" or hashtag, \"Is It a Thing?\" as I like to call it. And we want to unpack the latest trend or buzzword that's impacting the profession. So, this week's buzzword is \"fauxductivity\". And it's a term used to refer to employees keeping up appearances of productivity without actually achieving anything. So, instead of tackling meaningful tasks, they're apparently attempting to look busy, or maybe mouse-jiggling to give the illusion of working. So, common examples of \"fauxductivity\" reportedly include looking busy by checking emails or social media constantly, repeatedly organising and reorganising a workspace or desk. I feel that's seen or maybe attacked by that one, I'm not sure. Creating elaborate To-Do lists without any intention of completing them, including adding items you've already done or completed so you could cross something out and filling up time with unnecessary meetings or conference calls. So, David, is it \"a thing?\"\nDB: Well, I think there's two observations. So, one, I think it definitely is \"a thing\". It's the only thing that's new is we've just given it a new name, just given it \"fauxductivity\". I think it's always existed. And I was saying before we came in, in a previous organisation I worked with an individual who absolutely had got this down to a, you know, to a T and would, you know, spend at least, I guess on average a few hours every day, sort of circumnavigating the building carrying, this is how long ago it was, you know, carrying paperwork. You know, so carrying a bundle of files. And then whenever you saw them, you'd say \"hello\", they'd say, \"Oh, please don't stop me, David. No, I'm so busy. I'm so busy.\" And I'd go off and then I go to my meeting and then, you know, an hour later they'd have moved about, you know, five inches. Because they'd be stopping somebody else again. \"No, please don't stop me, Amanda, I'm so busy.\" And that would take up hours in their day. I mean.\nAA: Busy, busy.\nDB: Busy, busy, I'm so busy and I would just think, well, she's been that. She's been on the hallway for about three hours. So, but the other thing that popped into my head was this thing about in, you mentioned you know the mouse-jiggling thing. Have you seen that? So, that's a thing that you can buy. You can go on Amazon, then it's like a little thing that you put your mouse in, and it shakes the mouse.\nAA: Although, obviously, none of us would recommend that.\nDB: No, none of us would, absolutely. I'm not giving any \"fauxductivity\" tips here. Amazon suddenly sees a spike in mouse-jigglers. But I mean, who came up with that idea that when, \"oh what you need is something to jiggle your mouse while you go off and do something else?\" I mean, that's yeah. So, I don't think it's new. I just think we're just giving it a name.\nEH: I agree. It's definitely \"a thing\". And I also think you're always going to have that colleague. That colleague who is going to spend time wasting time and just, you know, just removing any productivity out of the day. So, there's always that one person. But I, I suppose as an empath, maybe I almost feel it's a dangerous term. Because actually, are we overlaying what needs to be a bit of rest or a bit of space and you know, you said, where did it come from? Well, you know, there's always a to and a fro. Lots of organisations have introduced productivity software and you know, checking and surveillance. So, where does it come from?\nDB: Yeah, number of mouse clicks.\nEH: Maybe counterintuitive for it to be, you know, for the software that's been given. But I also think, you know, Microsoft did a study around your productivity and your decreased levels of stress where you take scheduled breaks. So, you know in Outlook you can now reduce meetings by five or 10 minutes, so you give yourself time to recollect your thoughts before you go into the next meeting. So, I think even in \"fauxductivity\", in this new word, there's something that says, \"why are people maybe doing this? Is there a reason? Is the point that they need to take a break? Do they need to take a walk, do need some headspace before getting into the next activity?\" and so on.\nAA: I think that's a really positive way, for years I've had green time in my diary.\nDB: Yeah.\nAA: Which is time, pretty much every day, where I'll try and put a little bit of time in, just to think. And that might be the time that I rearrange my desk, but it's allowing myself to have that mental and physical reset sometimes, just to kind of think where we are. Maybe we need to be a bit kinder to people?\nDB: Well, it's funny. I mean, I was just thinking, actually, there's a sort of emerging theme, isn't there, that connects lots of what we've been talking about today, around \"are you treating the symptom or are you looking at what the root cause is?\" So, actually why are people doing you know, so actually is it because I need a break, you know? And actually, I need some mental downtime, and you know, I think we're still on that journey, aren't we, of adjusting post-pandemic? Which is, you know, the expectation that we're sort of \"always on\" or \"always available\" and, you know, we've got umpteen devices, and we live in a digital world and I'm with you, Amanda. I love rearranging my desk so.\nAA: I'm going to start going for that seasonal thing, decorating depending on the season.\nDB: Oh yeah. I'm not as bad as that.\nAA: I think it's going to be interesting. I mean, we'll, I'm sure we'll talk about it in a future pod, but this potential right to switch off, that's going to be really interesting about how that fits with us.\nEH: Yeah, in the digital world.\nAA: Yeah.\nDB: Yeah.\nEH: How do you do that?\nAA: Fascinating.\nEH: How do you do that? Yeah.\nAA: Thank you. That's all from us today. I'd like to thank our guests, Elizabeth and David, for sharing their thoughts on a breadth of topics and, as ever, you our listeners.

I've been Amanda Arrowsmith, sitting in for David D'Souza and this has been the HR People Pod.\nWhat does a wellbeing-focused work environment really look like, and how involved should employers be to ensure their workforce can live healthy working lives? Should all employers pay the recently uprated Living Wage, and how can you support your people if paying the voluntary Real Living Wage is simply unaffordable? Finally, are your colleagues working as much as they appear, or are they showing classic signs of 'fauxductivity'?\nCIPD's People and Transformation Director Amanda Arrowsmith discusses these questions and more with David Blackburn, Managing Director of David R. Blackburn Consulting, and Elizabeth Harvey, Head of HR at HSBC.\nRecorded 25 October 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 10: Employment Rights Bill special\nDuration: 00:45:32\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza (DDS): Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting business and the profession. My name is David D'Souza, I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD and joining me in the studio we have...\nCarl Quilliam (CQ): Carl Quilliam the CIPD's Public Affairs Manager.\nDDS: And...\nOonagh Johnston (ON): Oonagh Johnston\nDDS: And once again...\nMelaine Steel (MS): Melaine Steel.\nGareth Neale (GN): And Gareth Neale.\nDDS: And I'm really looking forward today because Mel's disagreed with everything that I've said this morning including the things where I've agreed with her. It's a pleasure to have you all join this show, this week's episode is going to be slightly different because we're having a deep dive focus on the implication of the UK Government's employment rights bill which came out yesterday, so this is hot off the press. We'd like to remind listeners that the CIPD is politically independent, we're not here to play politics. What matters to us is championing better working lives and the profession that we serve. We'll continue to engage with the government and other parties to influence their position on a host of issues on behalf of our members. But just before we dive into the key areas covered in the bill, I wanted to come back to Carl to shed a little bit of light, on the or a lot of light, Carl, it's up to you, degree of pressure, either way, on the broad implications for employers, and also just a bit of the stuff that's been happening behind the scenes. So, first off, it's probably worth talking about the three documents that were released yesterday. Each of them slightly less complex than the previous one.\nCQ: So, yeah, we got the full bill yesterday. So, that's over 150 pages, 28 provisions, there's a lot to digest in there. We also alongside that got the explanatory notes, so if anyone's had a chance to Google it yet they might have found that on the parliament website. And then after that, we got what's called the Next Steps Document, which is about 16 pages and that runs through in a lot simpler language what's broadly happening with the legislation and some of the next steps. It doesn't give us all the detail we probably like but it does give us a kind of direction of travel from the government.\nDDS: Fantastic, and just for anyone who does want to delve into it, there's a couple of things I'd say. First of all, the bill in itself is almost impossible to make sense of because it will say things like, we're removing one word from 14th paragraph and the document that isn't included here. The explanatory notes are super, super helpful. Because it kind of says this is what we're trying to do, and why, and when it may take place, and the next steps document is really useful for a lot of things that you thought might be in the bill but haven't been there. At the CIPD, if you remember one of the things you can do is go on our website and we have broken down the key elements of the bill, the implications that they have, and also the timelines. We will keep updating that as future consultations take place. Please do make use of it. We've got the podcast coming out today, that won't be a surprise to you because you're listening to it as I'm speaking about this, but we'll also keep going with videos and other things so that will be a one-stop shop for knowing how it impacts you in terms of the profession. So, coming back to that, we've got all of this information, how much in there was what we expected, how much shows that the government still committed to consultation, and what happens next.\nCQ: I think from a CIPD perspective, we've been quite engaged in the lead-up to this. I think the vast majority of this is what was expected from people who have had those conversations. The last thing you heard about it was the Labour party in opposition, and it was their new deal for working people. There's probably a few more surprises in there, actually some of the things in there may have been moderated or certainly will be subject to consultation in a way that you might not have expected. So, I think particularly that's a really sort of key point I think for people listening is that this is a big piece of legislation like I say, it's 150 pages, it's a lot of different provisions but there's we've got quite a long timeline now for a lot of it.\nUnfair dismissal has been a really big piece that's come out from the profession, particularly when we've had conversations when we've done surveys. There's been a lot of concern about the scrapping of the unfair dismissal qualifying period. We now know that's definitely going to happen, but what we also know is there'll be a new probation period and that's going to be consulted on next year so, in 2025, it isn't going to come in until the earliest autumn 2026. So, there's quite a long period now on something like that for us to both feed into what the bones of that probation period look like, but also then to understand it and implement it further down the line and that's the same across most areas.\nThere was a conversation that happened yesterday just after the bill was introduced, you and I were sort of listening to civil servants talk about some of these timelines. The vast majority of these the consultations are going to come in 2025 and actually not early in 2025, likely March, April, maybe earliest we're going to get some of the big consultations. That said, there's a couple. So, for those interested particularly in the trade union provisions, it's likely those are going to come fairly soon. So, this this year without getting into the details just yet, but there'll be bits there that are consulted on straight away and there's probably going to be some more consultation at the back end because there'll be secondary legislation as well, but that's one of the big bits that's going to come sooner. The rest of it likely next year.\nDDS: Guaranteed hours, zero hours is that another one that they kind of said that they go quite quickly art?\nCQ: The consultation piece, there will be a consultation around how zero hours impact agency workers, that's going to be the other thing that kind of comes this side of Christmas. They'll be likely to be more next year as well.\nDDS: So, for anyone listening who has been reading headlines over the last few months saying that they shouldn't be hiring, that this is going to fundamentally change everything, that next Tuesday the world is going to be like we've never known it. The reality is, this is going to be phased. We still don't know for the most part exactly what's happening in all the different spaces. The government is committed to consultation for a really extended period of time, and one of the other things that they said to us was that they will phase that consultation as well. So, they're not trying to do everything at once. So, they can relax a little bit,\nCQ: I think so. I think there's always a tension with this kind of thing, where businesses want the detail soon and that's one of the things the calls that people have made but actually we can't get that because of the consultation. So, this long timeline is good because it allows both that consultation but then hopefully towards the back end of 2025, we'll start to get more of that detail, there'll be a kind of recognition that businesses need time to implement this stuff.\nDDS: Excellent and look for the rest of the podcast, we've we brought Carl in so that if I say anything incorrect he can put me on the right track really quickly.\nOJ: He can give you a little kick under the table.\nDDS: Having both worked through about 400 pages of text yesterday, the other big take that I had from it, so it'd be good for you to confirm it, is that there were quite a few things that people were expecting to happen pretty close up front. That are actually a longer-term. So, single employment status, is one that's been pushed out. So, that's not even in the next steps beyond referencing that that's going to be over a longer time frame and the other one is right to disconnect which we've spoken about on this podcast prior and looks unlikely that they'll happen at pace and it looks far more likely to be a code of practice than it would be anything else, is that that about right? Anything else I've missed?\nCQ: No, I mean that's exactly it. And it's on those things it's at this point it's reading the tea leaves a little bit as to when they're going to come in. Hopefully there will be some of those conversations behind the scenes with civil servants and we'll get a bit more certainty, but that's exactly right. I mean the thing that that sort of says really is that, we've got 150 pages of legislation. We're also going to get loads more secondary legislation and we're going to get codes of practice. So, it is, it will be a lot, but there has been a recognition from government that actually this needs to be phased. It's not all going to you know, we're not going to get 100 consultations all at once. So, we will be able to feed in to the stuff that's in the bill, but then things like that, there'll be that bit more time as well.\nDDS: Brilliant, so if you're a practitioner listening to this, one, relax just a little bit, it's certainly enough to recognise that it's not everything happening at once and it's not everything happening now. Secondly, please do follow us on LinkedIn and other channels, we've just upgraded our website functionality to make it easier to find things as well. So, do go on there and look out and as I say we'll keep those key tables, those timelines, we'll obviously update all the supporting documentation as we find out more but you can at least relax this weekend or at least not worry about extra things arriving on your desk related to this. Really want to bring in, you know, Mel and Gareth now that's a whistle-stop tour because there's so many elements to it but I was just curious if any of you had any other elements that you noticed in the bill that you thought were worth talking about. We're going to do a deeper dive into the Single Enforcement Body, unfair dismissal and zero hours contracts or guaranteed hours as we kind of work through this podcast, but anything else catch your eye?\nGN: I think that the sexual harassment part and particularly the fact that the third party is now back in which it which they took out from the previous act. And I think that could be a challenge from a hospitality perspective depending on how it's written currently, it's very much a equals b equals c equals d which is very difficult to follow sometimes. But it's about actually how you avoid risk and it's going to have to take a lot of thought from hospitality companies, because we obviously have members of general public coming in, drinking, and anything you know could potentially happen. We try and prevent that obviously, but it's difficult, it can be a challenge. So, you know it's a really important piece of legislation, but I wasn't expecting that to be part of this particular bill.\nDDS: Yeah, so there are two prime changes, and we spoke about a couple of podcasts ago actually, sexual harassment, and the requirement to do risk assessment. Two changes seem to be a strengthening of the language to say that, all reasonable steps must be taken not just reasonable steps. And, secondly, that piece around third parties so making sure that you recognise your commitment as an employer isn't just to protect people from colleagues, it's to commit people, protect people, your workforce kind of full stop. So, yes, not one that I think have been heavily kind of trailed but a kind of important piece. Mel?\nMS: Yeah definitely that one I thought, I thought it was good that that that was in there. I think some of the other things relating to statutory sick pay, a lot of people yesterday were like well that happens anyway in most companies. Well, there's an awful lot of companies who do the absolute minimum they're not really tiny companies, necessarily too. So, I think bringing everyone up to a particular standard is not a bad thing to do that? I liked as well some of the protection relating to paternity, maternity, that kind of thing. Again, good businesses have gone way beyond some of that, but it's not the case actually in a lot of, in some of the big names, that they don't do that. So, anything where it kind of pushes us into 2024 and rather than relying on businesses doing the right thing, the tips and the gratuity thing, I obviously was my background for years and years ago, you know, I always thought that you know if you do good service, you should get your tips, and I've been coming, as a customer now, I've become increasingly disappointed with businesses who, you know, that forms part of their wage or what have you. So, again, if this just forces that behaviour to change then that helps. And I guess the thing, you know, what we've just talked about, it's great that we know we've got this lead period. But I would say, you know, with the trade union side of things, we're not going to major on it here.\nBut there are a lot of companies who over the last few years have been having these conversations and I think there will, there'll be quite a few members who will appreciate knowing getting support and understanding, kind of where they stand with that. And you know, hopefully someone who's got too many days to count of non-recognisable service for strike action back in her early career and non-pensionable, let's hope you know it becomes a good thing, where we can have really good constructive conversations you know with employees, employers, and trade unions. And Oonagh was saying that before we come in here, you know, make it a modern workplace which I like hearing you know that's got to be where we're all aiming towards.\nON: Yeah, I see it as some practical pragmatism that needed an overhaul that you know, it's 40 years probably since massive reform and the generation, the work generation coming through needs that kind of simplicity remove some of the complexities. So, for me it was you know. I could see that this is a modern type of working, it's more about being inclusive you know, there was lots of things for parents and women and better protection. That's been long overdue, to bring out the best in people, you know we know that bereavement can be crippling. So, you know to recognise that from day one, I think yeah, it's just how it should be. You know the bit for me personally the zero hours, we've used zero hours before hopefully we've always used them in a way that's provided flexibility. So, again it's a modern way of bringing more innovation into the workforce and enabling that flexibility. If you've got students or people that just want to work temporarily. As long as you provide them a guarantee within a fixed period, you're not abusing them. So, it, you know I applaud it that unscrupulous employers will now be stopped abusing that particular way of employing people. But for me, it was pragmatism and modernisation, a sigh of relief. Hurrah. And we're starting to kick some of the old practices.\nDDS: Quite unequivocally positive reaction there.\nMS: She is glass half full. I love it on a Friday.\nDDS: Look, we've been regularly polling our members, we'll continue to do so, holding senior round tables as well. It's going to be really interesting to see the reception when people have had a chance to reflect as well, but it's nice to at least start with someone cheering on the day after. There's plenty of time. I think Mel, that point around unions is really well made. I think it's going to be something that we need to look at our support for and members need to reflect on, greater chance of union recognition in organisations that haven't prior, it's a different skill set, different protections that are sitting in there as well. And I think broadly one of the other things that's been interesting from our point of view has been that kind of tripartite model of consultation that the government is going through, involving unions, involving business leaders, organisations like ourselves. And the government itself, and you've had the social partnership model in Wales for quite a few years now, and that's an interesting one for people to just kind of cast their eyes across and think about how that works. And the ramifications.\nGN: Can I just pick up on the union piece because for hospitality, that's quite a challenge because we don't really have a classic union for hospitality. And also from an HR perspective, the HR teams wouldn't have had experience of working with unions, and that in itself means that there's an education piece for the HR teams because particularly the younger generation would never have even experienced having to deal with unions, unless it was literally a disciplinary meeting. It's usually where you first meet a union person. There are challenges with it as well. I think if it's a broadly positive that it's about working with businesses to give good practices for employees, that's great. If it's the other way around, that's a challenge.\nMS: I think it's to try and see it, I worked for ASOS in a previous role, and so I absolutely echo what you said about a younger HR function that's never had experience. Exposure to unions, but if it's seen as a partnership and not going to you know absolutely to butt heads, it's a way of working through a particular problem with that group of individuals or taking a different stance of we've got this complex issue. How do we work together to resolve it for the better good of what we're trying to do for our workforce. I grew up in you know kind of financial services where it was you know, a staff association and it got very much, you do as I say. I always took the view even ASOS where you know they were striking outside, I went out and said, look, who wants a cup of tea? Somebody want anything to eat? And they were like, yeah, I'd love a cup of tea. And so that's how we brokered that conversation. You know, we're humans at the end of the day. We want to get the best out of you know how do we get this conflict resolution going.\nDDS: So, it's not a 100% guaranteed? So, we will try and provide more kind of content to our members on it but a cup of tea seems a good starting point. Coffee should be made available as well, people have different preferences. So, I'm going to move us on to I guess the first substantive topic which is around unfair dismissal and probation periods. When it was trailed, I think a lot of the media coverage was suggesting that essentially from day one of a contract, people would have exactly the same rights and protections as they would have if they've been with the organisation for 20-25 years. There's a lot of pushback on that, what appears to be what is going to be consulted on I think that's the best way of framing it now, is that there will be a probation period, potentially, of nine months, where there are different levels of protection, afforded, slightly unclear at the moment.\nIf an organisation were in a position where they felt that someone needed to leave during that period, they would need to have a formal meeting with the person where they could be accompanied, where they'd have to make that clear to them. Essentially running through what might be relatively normal business process elsewhere. That appears to be the substance of it at the moment. So, for any organisation that has stopped hiring and apparently there were some of those in the media on the basis of this change it appears at the very least it's different to that. There's still going to be consultation around whether it's nine months. So, the government has expressed their preference for nine months but it's also said they'll continue to review that and to consult. It has definitely been an area of contention for employers and we've spoken to, as you can imagine a range of major employers and SMEs with concerns about this. Genuinely wanted to open it up to the group with with how it's now currently formulated how big an impact do you think it will have?\nI think it goes back to everything in terms of you're saying about the time we've got. The head of this is about not panicking and planning. I talked to my team about this. We were already thinking ahead. We knew this is coming so we've already changed some of our induction processes so we've got proper forms, that hopefully will align with what the legislation is coming. It's also an education piece for managers, as well, about how to deal with performance and how to handle people's capability to do the role and some of the challenges with that.\nGN: And I think the fact that it's likely to come through in 2026 gives you time to actually plan out what you're going to do. Do I think that this is really scary? No, it is if you don't do anything about it, if you just think oh well, we're just going to continue as we currently are and then suddenly realise, oh my goodness, what do we do? I think the change from two years to potentially nine months or even six months, as long as you're prepared for that and as long as you're thinking that process through, and I think actually it's not a scary as it, it's made out to be.\nDDS: It's a really good point to make so we are probably two years away from this. So, they've said autumn 2026 will be the earliest. Equally listen, another couple of things that they'll need to work through including compensation for people in that position or who have a grievance or legitimate grievance in that space. Mel thoughts on it.\nMS: Yeah, I mean it is what it is, right?\nDDS: That's very true.\nMS: You know, I think it is challenging. We're in a situation at the moment where the tribunal service doesn't work right. So, we've got a two-year qualifying period. It's how when you're in those situations and how long it takes to get through the process if you end up in that, it's hard to advise businesses like you know stick it out sometimes and go through the actual process because actually what you've done is correct. And then it's like oh should we just pay to get this out of our hair. So, do I think that by doing this it changes the relationship the behaviours to treat people better, and such like. No, not really I can't see that this is the shining light that's going to change everything right by bringing in this legislation. I hope as part of it we work out OK, if people are going to be able to claim from day one. How does that actually work in reality? How does that get supported with Acas and all the rest of the paraphernalia that actually comes through when you go through this. And I think we have to start there because just by adding more into the current system, I think we'd all say would be a terrible way forward, right?\nThe probation period. I think you know there will be some employers that will be you know really strong, you know with managers in that sense of that's your, I mean it goes back in time as far as I'm concerned, that's how I started my career. You have a probation period, you use that time to test out whether the person can do the job and vice versa, and if not then that's the time you do what you need to do. So, I don't think that's dissimilar. I think it becomes more harder than we're well over the years. I think in the UK, we've probably softened that a little bit more, but in Europe and such like it's not dissimilar.\nDDS: Yeah, we certainly know of organisations that deliberately remove the probation period, and we'll now have to think about that in a different way. But equally, the processes that you'd have to go through seem really similar to what you do most places in their life cycle. Oonagh you've been a ray of sunshine so far, I'm assuming you think this is the greatest thing to happen to the planet ever.\nON: Do you know what? I do think it goes back to what I said earlier, it's simplification, it's efficiency. If you've been wronged, you don't want to wait two years to be able to fix that, and if that's scarred your employment experience, and you,  you know, you need to have your right to protection, but do you need two years for it? So, I do think, as we've discussed, and as Mel said, we've got a system that's not working and it's log jammed. So, if there's a way to do that, then do that and make sure that that agency works effectively. Will it stop us hiring? Absolutely not. I do think you need to get your ducks in a row. You need to understand if you've got someone that is not performing or you've got someone who's joined your organisation that is definitely there to cause trouble. Then, how do you manage that in an efficient and effective way, and it's not ruthless but you need as an employer to be able to deal if you've got with a bad apple and not be afraid of that. So, you need to have your processes. You need to be able to understand what you can and can't do, and we've got time to work that through. And there's enough skin in the game that we know, we know how to handle that if you do that effectively without it coming back to bite you.\nMS: And protection has been there from day one for you know we're talking about capability predominantly aren't we, right in here.\nDDS: Yeah, so automatically on fares they're already.\nON: We've had that protection there from day one on it. I mean with some of those cases I would like them to be seen and to be heard much quicker because I think spending your time in that system waiting for something to be heard is crippling, yeah, for both businesses and individuals. It's just not. So, I start from the position and I don't know if in the conversations you guys have had any, how we're going to sort out the bigger issue of what we all say isn't working at the moment because that has to be unlocked before we then kind of change the legislation.\nGN: Can I just talk from an employee perspective because, personally, I got dismissed just before the two-year gap. This goes back about 10 years ago.\nMS: Deliberately, probably.\nGN: Deliberately.\nMS: Yeah.\nGN: And you know from a person, it was a complete shock and I at the time I didn't really, fully understand the law. And I think actually there is a point here where if you can't work out whether someone's good enough within the first two years that's a bit worrying. There is a more reasonable time limit for the employee, and that there are processes in place, you know, so I think there's a balance here and I think absolutely businesses need time to assess someone, particularly someone in a senior position, because you can't work that out within you know a few weeks but there does need to be a balance and an element of protection for the for the employees. The one final thing I'll say on this is it's the Christmas day for employment lawyers. They're going to make an absolute killing out of this\nON: On settlement agreements, yeah, yeah.\nGN: Their dream, but that that dream will be made by employers who aren't planning and prepared for this sort of stuff, and that's the key bit here. If you are planned, prepared, you should be able to handle most situations.\nDDS: The risk appears to be minimal if you go through a minimal amount of formal process. It doesn't appear onerous currently, we'll have to wait and see what comes out of the consultation.\nON: I think that's true. But I would just say, not all businesses are equal in size in support in setup. And we've got many businesses in this country now, who are still quite big who don't have they have a very small junior HR function they might have a lawyer on tap now we can debate whether that's right or wrong. But I think we can't just kind of go into this as well because the world of work has changed but you know.\nDDS: So, what you've done there Mel is you've interrupted my bridge.\nMS: Find another segway.\nDDS: So, what's happened there just for clarity for anyone watching or listening is that my next sentence was going to be however, we know for many employers they don't necessarily have the structure or the expertise to be able to prepare for that.\nON: She read your mind.\nDDS:  It's good isn't it? It's alignment. But I was just like you need to remember and I'm like no, no, I have, it's even in the script.\nMS: Oh, we're getting like the husband or wife on a podcast now. We need to change this.\nDDS: I couldn't choose anyone better.\nMS: Oh my God, it's on tape and on video.\nDDS: And you don't even have to reciprocate. There are a few challenges here which is that we can see a few places in the bill where there's probably an increased chance of tribunal and that would be for most organisations, the balance of risk slightly shifts, and there are ways to mitigate it. One of the challenges that's been raised by the FSB amongst others, so the Federation Small Businesses, but we've also raised as well is that the education and capability in small organisations and knowledge of the law is also and often lower just by dint of circumstance. Those two things combine potentially to put increased pressure on Acas who attempt to avoid things going to tribunal, through mediation. The tribunal service itself, which is already in many cases creaking, leading to really long times for either employees or employers, depending on which the circumstances to access justice and resolution. But also, we've got a range of enforcement bodies which the government is planning to bring together under a Single Enforcement Body, which is, I think a sensible plan. I haven't heard anyone say that isn't a sensible plan, but the timing and phasing of that is key because what you don't want is for there to be more and more pressures on systems that haven't yet been reviewed.\nSo, the idea is to have a Fair Work Agency. There's a broader point here and I want to open it up to you all, which is there's a balance between education enforcement with this change. So, I'm curious as to where do you think the government has got a role, where different organisations have got a role to help people understand their legal rights and their legal obligations, and equally what would you want from that Single Enforcement Body that would really either give it teeth or make sure that was acting in a proportionate way. So, I'll open that up to you all but I absolutely agree like there's a greater burden of risk on SMEs. We need to recognise that as we go through so therefore we've got to have better mitigation for SMEs.\nGN: I used to have my own small business and I know that, you know the challenges and the conversations I would have with other people in small businesses who were constantly in fear and sometimes in fear of just simply employing people full stop. Calling it a Single Enforcement Body is absolutely what it shouldn't be called because that scares living daylights out of me.\nMS: I was going to say that's prohibitory, isn't it?\nDDS: They are going to call it a Fair Work Agency. Do you prefer that?\nGN: It should be about advisory and support first, and then enforcement later. So, it should be about advising and supporting businesses, and then if there is, they are ignoring what they should be doing, then enforcing because I think you know there's an element of a kind of a yellow card here that some businesses need, as a bit of a warning because actually, you can easily make a mistake or you can easily make a slip-up when it comes to employment law. It's very, you know, it's complex and as you said, Mel, they're often very junior HR people within small businesses that don't have that experience and knowledge. I've set up HR teams within small businesses and quite often there are mistakes galore when you go just simply go for a contract let alone anything else. And I think that's the real challenge is that there needs to be a support out there for small businesses to be able to be more confident in making decisions that are right for them and right for the employee.\nMS: I've worked for you know, SME. I've been parachuted in when there's been problems and I think what we've got to do is help them in a way that is going to again make things not debilitating and make things easy for them to find or access, so it needs some sort of overhaul. We know that, and it's probably time to say that needs to probably be a bit more radical. I think the fines that they need to put in place again for unscrupulous employers need to basically bite and have teeth rather than just being there, don't do that again. So, it's a balance isn't it? And I think it's providing the education, signposting, comprehensive guidelines but also when it's at the other end of the spectrum being able to say you're not be able to do that, that's just not on. And we'll find you will, we'll get you where it hurts, but not stop small businesses still operating the way that they need to operate.\nDDS: That yellow card concept is, it is, it so one of the things that we do know because we've got plenty of data on it is that minimum wage violations quite often are not intentional, it's a problem probably in the calculation, it's a lack of awareness what you haven't got to your point is it's not about being an unscrupulous employer. It's about finding an adherence to the law, trickier or the understanding of it, trickier, if we're making a raft of changes, I think there needs to be sufficient education before you get to the enforcement, and that's different to saying if employers are acting in a completely incorrect way deliberately, that that shouldn't be enforced. But I think it's a really interesting point around how you tell, how you separate but also how you have good enough oversight.\nMS: I don't think I have much confidence if I'm honest you know setting up a new agency I think what's always interesting in government is you know business being such a big thing but when you, you know work for departments and that is always the one that gets dissembled or you know or it gets split up it never has the consistency or continuity and one thing we know about businesses that's what they need. Setting this up I mean that in itself is no small order. So, we create it then what is it going to do? It should be there right but we've had we've got different departments already that should be there for business and support but when you try and get to engage and to take that agenda forward it's incredibly difficult.\nON: If you want to go and talk about defence or something else you can easily get in there and talk about that but business seems to be one of those things strangely for me that doesn't seem to hold the same whack. So, I guess our let's see if it kind of materialises. Can it materialise quick enough? And I think it should have some teeth. I completely agree there has been some really terrible things that happened with some businesses, and how they've kind of got away with it. And I think in we've got to a place in when it comes to financial issues that they're regulated, and it really hurts them when they do that. And the reputational damage that it does near enough breaks them as a business. Now, I don't want that because that means those people are then made unemployed etc. But I think again if they're going to do this then it's got to have some teeth.\nDDS: Yeah, and sometimes the teeth act as much as deterrent as anything else, like you say if you know that there are going to be sanctions and that they're likely, and that they're going to be serious, that forces you to take it seriously, and you know prep, like Gareth has a couple of years ahead of it.\nGN: Trying to, trying to.\nDDS: So, I'm going to bring it into the home straight now, but one of the things that I can say is that we think the Single Enforcement Body piece is actually almost key to making sure that the rest of this works in the way that it should, so it's going to be one of the areas that we'll be politely requesting and pushing the government.\nCQ: I was just going to say can I add a little bit at the end to that which is to say it feels like it's quite narrowly drawn at the moment, the Fair Work Agency. We don't know how well it's going to be resourced, that is a key question. An interesting thing in the legislation is that it will have a general power to take on existing enforcement powers that government already have. I'm not expecting that to be the thing that it starts to do on day one, but it does sort of open a slightly interesting door for us all in terms of actually what the future of that looks like if it works. If they get it up and running in a way that is doing all the things that we've talked about, actually there is an opportunity for organisations like the CIPD but for businesses generally to kind of push for it to be a bit more expansive and do a bit more potentially.\nDDS: So, I think it's always important in life to acknowledge your mistakes. Normally we only have three guests on here, we've had four, I completely forgot that Carl was sitting off to my right-hand side. Carl would you be able to explain to us the changes on and the framing, I think it's important from zero hours contracts to guaranteed hours contracts and the CIPD stance on this?\nCQ: I think you talked about on the unfair dismissal piece, nine months is the preferred thing for government. Actually, there's going to be a consultation around that. That's the same with zero hours contracts. They've talked about having a preferred I think 12-week reference period which will ensure organisations use that to set their hours, set hours for employees. So, I think that's the headline is that there's going to be consultation. We're going to have an opportunity to kind of feed in on it.\nDDS: So, if you work in something that would currently be regarded as zero hours contract and you do that for 12 weeks, you would then essentially have a reference period, potentially if it was 12 weeks where you'd look back and you'd have the right to essentially have a contract, that kind of recognised that. You'd have the right to opt out of that but it's designed to make sure that you don't have exploitative or one-sided employment practices where all of the burden of risk sits on the employee.\nCQ: That was much better than the explanation I started on.\nDDS: Look, I knew there was a reason I've been ignoring you, Carl. OK, I'm going to pay for the that for weeks now. Can I just say that? Carl and the team have been putting in such amazing shifts to get us up to speed, and to get me in a position where I can actually cogently describe it, that's possibly the cheapest shot we'll have in this podcast. So, what the government is trying to do is provide a degree of security of earnings. Implications for employers really interesting on this one. I don't think anyone would ever defend any employment practice that could be turned exploitative equally the level of flexibility and that's provided historically for the employer and employee can sometimes be mutually beneficial. Any thoughts on this one before we close down?\nGN: Hospitality, it relies a lot on zero hour contracts. And I think it's become over reliant. I think what happened during the pandemic was there was a big panic about actually offering people a set of hours purely and simply because during the pandemic we couldn't guarantee it. And so, what suddenly became a trend and has become a trend throughout hospitality is offering zero hour contracts, it's the first thing you do for majority of roles. And I don't think there's a real need to, and there's a way in which you can work around this, they're talking about this 12-week period, I think it is possible to be able to work out for majority of those zero hour contracts now. Here's how many hours we can offer you and what we can do with that. There are some, there are some people that it really works for a zero hour contract is a great thing. I mean, I worked in the leisure industry previously and personal trainers would never sign anything other than a zero hour contract because for them they could earn more money elsewhere. And I think that's really key and I think also for employers, flip that around for events companies, you can't guarantee hours. So, there is a balance here, but I do think that there has been a bit of an over reliance on zero hour contracts, and I think there's a rebalance that's required with it.\nDDS: I think, you'll have to explain to me at some point what a personal trainer is. It's an entirely new concept to me, so we'll pick that up afterwards. Any final thoughts on zero hours?\nON: Zero hours are part of your employment toolkit and it's a diverse way of working. It enables people to have that flexibility, and I wouldn't want to see that faced out as, you know, the fire and rehire stuff that needs to be got rid of. So, I think zero hours, as long as you're using them fairly, as long as the individual is getting what they want out of it as well and you have that framework, then I hope that they're here to stay, but in the way that we all want to use them effectively.\nDDS: That's a really good point around fire and rehire as well. We haven't spoken about that, but that's another change which is perhaps more caveated than unions may have wanted, which is essentially that notion of fire and rehire, so kind of mass change of terms and conditions. You will be able to do that, but only if it's essentially stopping the business from serious harm. So, the existence of the business is at threat, is pretty much the way that it's framed in terms of it being a going concern. So, that'll be an interesting one to, again, look at the justification, the range and space within that. Mel, final word with you.\nMS: On?\nDDS: Zero hours contracts. Anything you like, actually.\nMS: Yeah, no, listen, I think we can't be talking about modernisation and such like and empowering individuals and then treating them like, you know, we know what's best for them. So, I think there's definitely, you'd expect that from an independent, wouldn't you? But there's definitely a place for them, for sure. I think technology is advancing where people can select in your industry and in other industries where you can select your own shifts, you can swap shifts, you can get that flexibility that you want in life and work loads of hours, one month, and less, you know, anything that kind of stops that from happening where it's an individual's choice would be terrible. But also, I've been horrified by hearing some of the stories about, you know, where people just can't live off of the way that they've been contracted.\nON: Or they've been cancelled at the last minute and not.\nMS: Yeah, you know, things like that, there's no place for that. So again, this is where it's difficult with legislation, isn't it? Is trying to litigate against, you know, what we consider is good human ways of working in 2024.\nGN: The thing for me is it's the conversation with the employee and even before they're an employee that is the critical part. What works for you as well as works for us? And the balance between the two. And I think all of this is, that's what it's really focused on is, you know, having that conversation with the employee, seeing what, you know, hours they can work, what's going to work for us as a business. If you have those conversations early, then you don't get the bigger issues that come up later down the line. Final thought from you, Carl. The invaluable Carl, who I couldn't live without. Carl.\nCQ: Yeah, the word exploitative obviously has come up quite a few times when we've talked to employers about this. The phrasing in what was the Labour manifesto was they were going to ban exploitative zero hours contracts. I just wanted to throw in that actually, we don't need to focus too much on that wording. We do have proposals, we have consultation. That word is a word that was used politically so that they could say the words ban and zero hours contract without banning zero hours contracts. So, I think we've reached the point now where we can kind of move on and say, actually, this is what it looks like. We don't have to worry about necessarily what they mean by exploitative. We just need to focus on the proposal.\nDDS: Absolutely makes sense. I'd like to thank everyone. So, Mel, Gareth, Oonagh, and the invaluable Carl. I cannot believe I forgot you for so long. I'm so sorry. For anyone who's been listening today or watching today, the key messages from us as a professional body are I think probably threefold. One, you don't need to panic. As Gareth mentioned, what you do need is you do need to prepare. But actually, there are some things you can't prepare for yet because if you believe the newspaper headlines, they're hurtling towards you and the reality is this is going to be a long and complex process where there's still space for voice and still. The second thing is that you have a chance to influence us, to then influence the government, because we're at the heart of these conversations, to make sure that those changes are as best informed as they can be. We're delighted to be in regular conversations with the government around this. We're genuinely right at the centre of the conversations. We're very happy that some of the things we've asked for have come to pass. And indeed, the over-framing ask that we've made around there being broader and longer consultations. So, we can work through detail has also come to pass. So, we'll do that as your professional body. And the third thing is we will keep our assets and our communication, and what you need as a professional, to see you through this period up to date. So, keep visiting the website, keep looking for the updates. We'll make sure they're really prominent when they change. Our fact sheets and all of the other areas will change as and when needed to. What you won't find is speculative changes on our behalf, because our job is to make sure that you are properly equipped and properly informed.\nSo, really hope this has been helpful for you today. Please do keep staying involved with this. Please do keep using the things that we have. I mentioned it really briefly earlier. We've upgraded our website, so it is now far easier to find what you're after, and we'll keep working on those things. Expect more from us on the policy side as we pass through this period and continue to consult. But also, on the practice side, it's our job as a professional body to make sure you've got what you need to do these things well and properly. So, thank you to everyone who's contributed today. Next time, we'll go back to the more normal format, funny stuff. Talking about practical stuff that's probably happened that week rather than things that may happen in three years' time. But thank you very much for listening. This has been the CIPD HR People Pod.\nThe UK Government has proposed the biggest overhaul of workers' rights in a generation. What will this mean for employers and people professionals? Our panel reflects on the Employment Rights Bill announcement, examining the potential impact of the provisions, such as removing the two-year qualifying period for protection against unfair dismissal, probation period changes, ending 'exploitative' zero-hours contracts and the role of a new, single enforcement body, the Fair Work Agency.\nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Carl Quilliam, CIPD Public Affairs Manager; Mel Steel, former HR director and interim people and transformation leader; Gareth Neale, Head of HR at Crimson Hotels Limited; and Oonagh Johnston, Group People Director at Vesty Holdings Limited.\nRecorded: 11 October 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 9: RoboCop| Presenteeism | Discretionary effort | 'Un-bossing'\nDuration: 00:35:27\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting business and the profession. My name's David D'Souza. I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD. And joining me in the studio, we have:\nMelanie Steel: Melanie Steel.\nDDS: You sounded slightly unsure there, do you want to?\nMS: Yeah, I like the err.\nDDS: I've met her before and it is Melanie Steel, I can vouch for that.\nCaroline Roberts: Caroline Roberts.\nDDS: And\nJo Carlin: Jo Carlin\nDDS: Fantastic. It's a pleasure to have you back, Jo. I think this is your third time for you?\nJC: Third.\nDDS: Third time for you Mel? Second time for you, Caroline. So, a bit of catching up. It's like the hard core, like the hard core, it's.\nMS: Available, I thought.\nDDS: It's a mixture.\nMS: The willing.\nDDS: It's a mixture. There's a Venn diagram and you're both available and dedicated.\nMS: Yeah, it's quite small.\nDDS: So, just before we get started, we always have a section where we talk about what people have been reading, watching, consuming, finding interesting. Jo, if I start with you.\nJC: Oh God, right, so I have had a book recommendation that I've got in my order off Amazon called \"The Messy Middle\". And our CEO recommended it, so I'm going to give that a good read. I am reading some, like nonsense fiction as well. I think last time I talked about the, did I say I was reading \"The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat\"?\nDDS: Yes\nJC: By Oliver Sacks, that's a really good one and also \"Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired To Connect.\" That's a brilliant one. I keep picking that up and putting it down. It's quite chewy.\nDDS: Yes. Excellent, Mel, come to you next.\nMS: So, book-wise, not anything at the moment, deliberately because I wanted to do more kind of podcast reading and just like not have 500 articles saved that I need to go back and read and then by that time. So, I'm trying to do more like, in the moment stuff. Watching, I've been watching. I don't know how I missed this before, but that programme about round the world, the race.\nDDS: \"Race Across The World\", it's the greatest thing ever, it's lovely.\nMS: Yeah, \"Race Across The World.\" I don't know how I missed it before, but I think I saw like an advert for the celebrity one and then I realised that it'd gone back and I'm absolutely loving it in the sense of this. Anyone who knows me knows I love, like I've never backpacked or anything, but actually even watching this I'm saying to my husband how amazing would it be to just go off and go through, you know this. I mean maybe not quite as extreme as what they're doing, but just to go through these different countries and understand. And it does restore my faith a little bit of how helpful and kind people can be.\nDDS: If you saw the Canadian one, all he had to do was stand at the side of the road and go, \"I'm trying to get to the other side of the country\" and somebody would go, \"oh, that's fine. I'll drive you there\". For no reason.\nMS: That's so nice.\nDDS: It was so nice, defeated the object of the whole programme. They had a limited budget, but any Canadian would take you anywhere and feed you with their family and take you in. That's awesome though.\nMS: Yeah. So, I'm watching that with husband, and we're thoroughly enjoying that and playing into the whole kind of future travel and trips that we might do.\nDDS: There's maybe an HR version to be done, actually. Just get senior professionals and we'll race from one end to the country to the other on a limited budget. We're doing an extended podcast based on that. I'll free up a week next year so.\nJC: Nobody's giving us a lift.\nMS: I would love to do that, yeah.\nDDS: Caroline?\nCR: Well, rather like Mel. I'm listening to a lot of podcasts. I'm really into \"The Rest Is History\" at the moment because I think there are a lot of HR lessons that can be learned from things like the French Revolution. And it makes you realise that things aren't quite as bad as we think. But what I'm reading at the moment is actually a book about the life and times of Machiavelli, which I actually think is essential reading for anyone who works in human resources.\nDDS: For anyone who's not familiar with Machiavelli, do you want to give a broader overview?\nCR: I think suffice to say that he's known for writing a book called \"The Prince\", and it's a study of leadership and it has top tips and things like doing complicated exits as an HR director. And his advice is very much, do it very swiftly. Exit someone so that they don't have time to gather their ammunition or the details for their ET1. But there are an awful lot of parallels for today's HR, budding HR professional.\nDDS: Yeah, like, are actually practical. So, for any students who are listening or people who haven't heard of Machiavelli before, he existed in the time of the Italian city states so lots of competition between the individual cities. He wrote a practical primer on essentially how to run a city state effectively. And it's probably a nice companion piece with Sun Tzu's \"The Art Of War\" which is obviously slightly more aggressive. But they're both, sort of, timeless texts that tell you how to do a thing in a really functional way, whether or not you agree with that thing. So, lots of you will have come into contact with the issues around Harrods that have come up in the media and the allegations there, and a large number of women coming forward to talk about hugely traumatic life-changing experiences. I read the deeper BBC article yesterday and it genuinely, it's difficult to read it and not have a physical reaction to it. Some of the stuff in there is absolutely horrific. We covered sexual harassment on the last podcast. We covered how it feels to be an HR professional when something horrific hits your desk or an allegation happens. We covered the changes in the law in the UK around your duties in that space and we covered actually the level of prevalence as well. So, we won't be covering that in detail because I think two in a row would be too much. But please, if you are interested in that, there's some really good content there. As I say, we only published couple of weeks back. Equally, the entire month we've been focused on conflict in the workplace and sexual harassment as part of that. So, if you go on our LinkedIn feed, go into our website, you will find information around that as well. So, going to park that and try and change the tone. But as I say, it's not that we're ignoring it, we've covered it quite extensively, recently. You will have heard some of our advisors on the radio, kind of, in the press this week as well. We will never comment on an individual organisation. We will talk about what organisations need to do in situations like that. So, going to pause - complete change of tone. First story today. Could we be seeing '90s science fiction coming to life? So, a large retailer has introduced its own RoboCops, robotic security guards known as PID 360 to combat rising thefts in stores, which are a genuine problem and a genuine issue of risk for retail staff, as well as the financial impact, across Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. These devices, according to the press, emit a loud warning siren and a menacing message in a Northern Irish accent, which seems like a very specific design choice has been made there, which probably raises its own questions, and they're designed to deter intruders. It comes as new research from Thomson Reuters says, two thirds of legal, tax and accounting professionals think AI could save them hundreds of hours. There's a piece here around how we utilise technology most productively. There's also a piece around job displacement. Again, as the professional body for HR, we'll be covering a lot more of that in times coming and the people development opportunity of what we do is key there as well because in terms of reskilling people and keeping them up to date. Jo, if I come to you first. You can either talk, I'll give you two choices. You can either talk in depth about the RoboCop security guard, or you can talk more generally about the issue and job displacement.\nJC: I mean, I just think Terminator, you know, I can't help it.\nDDS: Well, that's worse, isn't it.\nJC: Yeah, but I think there's just part of me that, I don't know for the, certainly, for what it's being utilised for, whether we agree or disagree with the use of Northern Irish accents is irrelevant. I think you're right. I think there's roles that AI can play that arguably, as people, human beings, it's probably better for us not to be doing that. I think in general, if I look at AI in general. I don't know. There's a lot of talk about displacement of roles and what it's going to mean, but actually maybe it's just that we need to change, and we need to change how we look at stuff and we need to change how we look at security, for example. So, maybe we don't need a load of security guards because actually that's putting them in danger, potentially, but maybe we need something else from those individuals to look at it differently. I think it's the same with everything though it's the same with every profession. And to look at it critically and ethically and work with people to say, \"how can we enhance?\" but give them an opportunity to say, \"OK, your role might not be this, but it could be this.\" So yeah, I mean I'm going to go to Newcastle next weekend. I'm going to looking out for RoboCop.\nDDS: OK. I mean, I hope to see you again. I hope that doesn't end badly.\nJC: I'll take a picture and send it to you, David.\nDDS: Well, I will look forward to that. Caroline, thoughts?\nCR: There was a study recently, I think it was BCG did it when they were looking at the role of AI and how it could help productivity. And it did help all performers but where things required interpretation, there wasn't so much of a role for AI. And I think it's very easy to jump to conclusions with AI and, you know, talk in very blanket terms. But I think it's really important that teams get together, talk about what AI can do, what they've found, but also its shortcomings. Because you think about the security guard, I think was it, was it the ED 209 was the RoboCop?\nDDS: It was, yeah, \"you have 30 seconds to comply.\" yeah.\nCR: Yeah, I mean, quite honestly, you know with looking at the resourcing and policing, you know, if someone goes and steals a load of fillet steak from Marks and Spencer's, whatever, what's going to happen at the moment? There's not the infrastructure. So, it's almost a bit of, \"well look over here. There's something going on over here\" when in fact there are other much bigger issues. I think the other thing around anything to do with AI. It's a leadership challenge. It's a people challenge. It's not just a bit of tech.\nMS: Yeah, I mean, theft is a big issue in retail, right? But as Caroline said, you know, there needs to be a different way to deal with it. I'm not sure that's going to deal with it, but I don't want to minimise the fact that it's hard on retail staff having to try and deal with stuff and in these particular locations I'm sure that it's rife and not great. And so, they're trying what they can, I guess to try and be a deterrent. So, let's see if that pays dividends at all. On the AI side of things, I think things are moving quick, right? I kind of like every week. I kind of dropped the book reading thing because I'm like, \"Hell, I don't think I can catch up at the moment of how quick things are moving.\" And there was an article this week by Andy Spence who does the futuristic stuff and I think it was Matteo [phonetic, 10:50] that had written it this week, but he was explaining, like with software engineers, just how close is AI performing to those and redoing the tests they did six months ago and how close they are now in the reasoning side of things. And you go this, this is a lot to get your head round. You know there is obviously huge benefits but there's also. I think HR have a difficulty because, yes, there's about the roles and stuff, but the ethics piece is the thing that probably keeps me awake most at night because it's the thing that, you know, people probably don't want to focus on so much. Everyone's very excited about the shiny new object side of things, but no-one really wants to think sometimes about the consequences, and then it's typical that HR have to kind of step in and help with some of that. And there was also, I think it was Hunley that had done some 2025 predictions for recruitment. And just in that talent acquisition space, how much further the human interaction kind of is going to be and I think it only really comes to life, I was with like 300-odd students this week and they're all going into the workplace, you know, next year. When they're talking about their experience so far of recruitment or graduate schemes, or understanding them, they don't have any contact with anyone. And so, when a human actually turns up, the queue was like as if I knew all the answers, but it was like, you know, long in that sense of people just wanting to ask a human, I guess, some stuff. So, I think we've got our work cut out, but I think there's still a lot of companies that don't have great HR software and technology in them. So, when we're talking about this and the advancements and like this week with the, there was a big conference workday wasn't there in the US, in Vegas, I think, talking about the agents and stuff. What about the organisations that haven't even got that in? And then people say, \"oh, well, that's only the small stuff.\" No, it's not.\nDDS: And there's a lot of small organisations there, if you like, they're like the backbone of the economy. So, I think it's some really practical stuff and please feel free to chuck some extra stuff in. One: where you are working with a software provider, look at the road map as well and the AI integration, because that's going to stop you having to go off and do it separately. Secondly, think really practically about use cases because it's really easy to have a general chat about technology coming, but actually what problems are you trying to solve and where can it help you?\nCR: Yeah.\nDDS: Thirdly, don't be afraid to reach out to others through our communities or other means to other organisations that are facing the same challenges so that you're not just feeling like there's a big, overwhelming thing coming, but you're drawing on the resources and the people and the expertise that you have around you. Because I think otherwise, it just feel, it's really easy to ostrich it and go \"I know there's something coming, but you know, it's not quite here yet.\" To your point around the ethical problems and the ethical challenges, you need the time and space to think those things through. Now, I'll give a really practical example. I was chatting to someone around utilisation in a contact centre and what they said is they'd stripped away a lot of the low value calls or the repetitive calls, but it only left the really intense calls.\nJC: So, all day.\nMS: So that has a knock-on impact? Well, I my organisation is a call centre, and it has a real knock-on effect on well-being so it has a, and then you've got a whole range of new skills that you get caught out with if you're not careful and you move too fast. If you flick that switch too fast, which we haven't, you're stuck.\nCR: I mean, somewhere where I've seen it done really well is around stroke pathways in the NHS and at the trust where I work there's been some brilliant work around there in terms of looking at people's scans. Because, if someone rings 999 because they think you've had a stroke, it's really important that you're treated as soon as possible. Every hour counts. But trying to get somebody to look at that, to compare things, that's something where AI can come in and they've had much, much better patient outcomes from doing that, which they have then translated into the community. AI is looking at data from community GP practices and then seeing if anyone's at risk, can they, you know, treat people, giving them preventative medicine. But that's being done step-by-step with the clinicians and not as a separate thing that's suddenly in implementation or transformation.\nDDS: People are working more hours than they're contracted to. That isn't particularly new, but Aesh [phonetic, 15:20] have reported that over half of them are still working whilst feeling unwell, so a presenteeism challenge there and one in four people are working more than 48 hours per week. Are extra hours par for the time if you want to get ahead? I'm going to go for that as like the kind of biting question. Is it still a case that discretionary effort needs to come in the form of hours? And if you want to progress your career, you should be the last person to, kind of, log in or the first in? Mel, what are your thoughts?\nMS: I think we're muddying up a number of things there. I think having been first in and last out doesn't make you someone who is, you know, using your discretionary effort necessarily wise. It shouldn't be the same person doing that. I think there's multiple things there, I think if people are doing work, they should be paid for it. There's a simple kind of for me, basic equation in that. I have a big issue with companies that, as someone who worked in restaurants, you know and stuff in my early career, sometimes they used to try and change it. Say, \"You need to be here, you know, 20 minutes before to do.\" But you didn't get paid until. My view is, you need to be there, that you start work on the time that they're paying you from, right? That's just how it is. That's what contract's about in that sense. I think you know, as you go through your career and then you're being salaried, and you're expected to maybe do other ways as ways to do that and flexible working and how that works. But I also think, speaking to younger folk today, I like the fact they're a lot more appreciative of their time and where they want to spend it. If I'm really honest on it, I was someone that went through my career and very much, you know, would do extra hours and was told, \"if you did this, you'd get that.\" I didn't really challenge it, if I'm honest and probably made some quite big sacrifices personally to do that, but I'm pretty proud of like some of the people that I speak to now who are in their 20s, bright, energetic, in really, really great jobs in companies but refuse to do this presenteeism to a bit, and actually there's been a few of them who have left those jobs because the expectation been placed upon them is they have no life. I mean, I'm talking extreme. They're in at 6:00 in the morning, they're there till 11:00 at night, they're expected to do stuff at weekends, you know. Like big companies, won't name them but we know who they are. And they're just like, \"I'm not doing that. I want to be able to, you know, do my sport.\" They work hard and that's not the issue, but there is definitely this piece that's jarring, which is slightly different, that career piece than if you're hourly paid-type work and you're not getting paid for the hours that you do. So, I don't think it's a bad thing on individuals pushing back on what I did. I mean, I can't, like.\nDDS: And setting boundaries.\nMS: And setting boundaries and actually, now I would not give up doing something that was for personally for me, whether that's, you know, fitness or what have you, I would, I would really hold it hard because I know how important it is to me and the fact that they've got that understanding in their 20s to do it, it will actually serve them better, I think, in the workplace and in the future. So, I think that's how it should be, not the presenteeism bit. But if we're talking about hourly pay kind of stuff and being exploited, no, if you're doing the hours, you should be paid. If you're going over a certain, then you should get paid overtime. That kind of thing.\nJC: I think the HMRC has got, has nailed that one though, hasn't it, for the hourly pay? I know for sure a couple of organisations I've worked in have been on the receiving end of some pretty meaty audits and certainly I think that's, and I'm not, you know, by no means against that, I think that's the right thing to do. But I'm with you, Mel. I think there's a big difference between discretionary effort and presenteeism and my generation, which is slightly older than the generation now coming through.\nDDS: That was so delicately put that was just beautifully done.\nJC: It was, wasn't it? Thank you. Because it's podcast and nobody can see me, David, that's what it is. I think there's a difference because we thought presenteeism was discretionary effort, yeah? that's it. We were, you know, we were the whole \"we've got to be the first ones in.\" I mean, who cared? I was playing solitaire. You know, sometimes at 7:00 in the morning.\nCR: Eat your breakfast.\nJC: But I was stood. I was there, but I think there's a massive difference, isn't there between presenteeism, which as \"I'm just going to turn up and be there\" frankly, or discretionary effort which is \"I'm going to come and I'm going to do my best work for that organisation whilst I'm there.\" And I think that's the piece that we all need to get right in our own minds because it, I'm with you, I'm not giving up my some of the stuff that I probably would have given up, yeah? I mean, I was, I was the person who said \"yes\" to every project. I think that's different. And I say that to a lot of people who are coming through now that we're, you know that you mentor along the way. There's a big difference between always being available, like all of the time and saying \"yes\" to the stuff that's going to stretch you. And I think that that's a really healthy rebalance that's happened.\nMS: Agree.\nCR: Maybe over the last decade or so.\nDDS: I remember having a conversation with a colleague years ago. I hope she, if she is listening, this conversation took place, and you'll know the one. And she was working till 9:00 every night and I was saying, \"why are you doing that?\" And she was going, \"because there's no capacity to cover it.\" And I was like, \"there's no incentive for the organisation to do anything other than having you working till 9:00 every night\" because the work's getting done, you're not complaining or raising about it. I was like, \"you've locked that in\". And it is about those boundaries and, you know, that wasn't atypical, you know, going back through the years, you would like to think, I guess, to your point, Mel and to the kind of way you're framing it with the people you're mentoring, that we could maybe get better at that rather than wish the same on the next generation coming through.\nMS: Absolutely.\nDDS: Because I think there is that \"we did the hard yards, so therefore you must\" which you hear all too often.\nCR: No, no, I think it's a ridiculous comment.\nDDS: Rather than like, wouldn't it be great if we could just create better working conditions for people full stop? And if we could play a part in architecting that is a far better ambition than. \"Well, guess what, we suffered. So, you're going to have to do the same if you want to\".\nMS: People are fatigued, otherwise, it's getting to the weekend and they're dropping.\nCR: Well, absolutely. And I think there's a, there's actually some really negative sides to this. I mean that you've got the economic pressures, people want to keep their jobs. You know, there are some managers who manage by fear. You know, they want to get a bonus and things like that. Some managers measure performance by presenteeism and rather than outcomes.\nJC: Sure.\nCR: I think there's a whole range of equality issues if you're, if that's the kind of, you know, work that people are expected to do. But I've noticed there's a lot of hybrid guilt. So, people say, \"well, I'm going to work from home two days a week, but it's OK, I log on at 7:00 in the morning, and I check my emails, and then I drop the kids, you know, for 15 minutes. But then I'm back, and then I'll work in the evening as well\", just because they feel they have to justify a hybrid working arrangement and I think that's really sad.\nDDS: Yeah, I'd agree. Caroline, I'm going to come first to you on our next one, which is our newly launched Resourcing and Talent Planning report, which you can download from the website, found that more than 1/4 of employers had new hires simply not show up and over 2/5 had new joiners quit within a year. I guess the second bit of that's maybe a bit less surprising, that feels like one for the ages. But a quarter having new hires just simply not show up, is it a sign of the times? Do you think that's reflective of the market or are they indicators of actually some of things we've spoken about with different expectations, different commitments to employers? Any thoughts?\nCR: I don't think it's a new thing. I worked somewhere once where, after I've been there about a week they said, \"well, you're doing better than the other person who joined a couple of weeks ago because they climbed out through the toilet window during the 11:00 AM break on the induction day.\" I admire their ingenuity, actually for doing that. It's interesting, it's part of the employer-employee contract though, and you know some places you work, they will have a great induction, you're really committed the induction starts before you join, they've already won hearts and minds. And others, you know, you might feel it's a bit of a privilege to join them and I think if you're in a profession where there is that kind of choice you do see the dropouts, but I don't think it's anything new in particular. I think people have always done that, there is something about the expectations. Yeah, I don't see that this is particularly new story, people have always been climbing out of those toilet windows.\nDDS: I'm not sure that sure is a sentence, that feels like I mean.\nJC: And also, lots of windows don't open now.\nDDS: I think between us we have a fair degree of experience, and the toilet window climbing was quite new, quite novel for me.\nMS: I think it's a good sound bite for this podcast.\nDDS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. It is.\nJC: If you ever feel like climbing out the toilet window, listen to the podcast.\nDDS: Mel, your thoughts on it? New, old, stuff that we can do?\nMS: I think in some industries, for sure it's draining. You know, when you're doing high-volume-type recruitment. You put a lot into it, and people not even let you know. I also was quite surprised last year of seeing profession, profession people in HR too. And I don't know why I have a higher, kind of, threshold for HR practitioners in this.\nDDS: Because we're better, because we're just fundamentally better.\nMS: Because I feel like they should be if you're in there, you know, trying to advise.\nDDS: If you're, if you're listening to this podcast, you're a better person. Just know that.\nMS: And them doing the ghosting is well, you know of being in quite a big process and then just suddenly disappearing out of it. And no, no conversation, no honesty. And it's a small world, right? We all know we're one degree of separation from someone.\nDDS: It's relationships, then.\nMS: So, if you do go, we're going to go and find where did you go. Because I'm just nosey like that. Because if you do, do that, ghosting and seeing it happen, you know, with a lot of colleagues when they were hiring, I just find that incredible they're doing that. And I think at some point you have to be careful that doesn't catch up with you. I wonder if it will be difficult going forward because you know some of this is about how much you're bought into organisations that reputation or your own reputation I'm talking about, in that you can be honest. But I also see the flip side this year. You know, it's a really difficult market as well out there. And I always would say to people \"be conscious, be honest\" because there's other people that would, you know, die to get those opportunities too. And years and years later, no matter what we seem to do in the resource and recruitment world, it just still blows my mind that we've got all these great people who want to go and do something great, and then we've got all these employers that are looking for great people. But no matter what tech, no matter how we do it, we all, we still seem to have this disconnect.\nDDS: Yeah, the match is never perfect.\nMS: Of getting the right people in the right place at the right time to use that.\nDDS: Jo, you're, you're a large well, you're not personally a large employer, you're an individual person.\nJC: Oh yeah, we're a pretty large employer. In fact, we've just acquired another organisation that's added another 2000 on as well. So, we're a pretty large, pretty large, high volume, yeah. No-shows, bounce-outs, whatever you want to call them are fairly commonplace but getting less, and they're getting less because what we've done, to go back to your, to your point Caroline, is we've actually said, \"what can we digitise, outsource and which leaves us free to do the onboarding\". Or the piece, the human content. I think going back to your piece Mel at the beginning where you said you had this huge queue of people. We found that by flipping it and pushing all of the, you know, the administration and the stuff which really isn't making any difference out and just having a few good people, focused on talking to the people coming in. It's had a massive difference, because it's big money, you know, it's huge money for us. If we're churning, it can be catastrophic. So, we've managed to reduce our attrition rates pretty significantly. I think something like 50% over a year which is bucking the trend. But I'm, like you, we're seeing it more and more in professional roles, not necessarily HR but that's probably because I haven't hired too many people in HR, but other roles, you know, significantly senior roles. Your, getting to the very point where they're hired, they're on, they're on-boarded, you've got their kit and then you get a call the week before, they go really quiet. And then they say, \"oh, I've decided to stay where I am.\"\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: Yeah, and for anyone.\nMS: I've got a better deal.\nJC: I've got a better deal, yeah.\nDDS: For anyone early, early in your career. Particularly as you kind of reach the point where actually some of the choices, you might make a more relationship driven as Mel says and Jo's kind of pointed out, that's the kind of thing that can stick. So those relationships matter, you want someone to think actually this person's dependable or they'd see this through so.\nJC: They've just got to be honest with you.\nDDS: Yeah, honesty, it helps, doesn't it? We have a section that we call, \"Is it a thing?\" where we take something that's either blown up in the media or online and we go like, \"is that a buzzword or is it actually a thing?\" I was asked earlier in the week, and you may have seen some articles about it. Genuinely, I had to write to our media team and go \"specifically, am I being asked a question around unbossing or conscious unbossing?\", because they're two different things. So, really quickly, unbossing is organisations removing the middle management tier in the belief that it is going to create a better connection between the leadership and purpose of the organisation and frontline staff. We've seen some organisations commit to that. It's kind of a framework of thinking that they need to do in a different way. Conscious unbossing is coming from the other side of that equation, which is primarily Gen Z, potentially more than half of Gen Z, according to one report not wanting to be middle managers because it's just not worth the hassle. So, it's too stressful, management's too big a headache, doesn't pay enough to make up for the reality of having to look after a group of people.\nJC: Smart.\nDDS: And so that's been termed \"conscious unbossing.\" So, Robert Walters, I think, have coined that term in quite a smart move, it's had lots of media coverage. So, Jo, I'm going to come to you first. Is conscious unbossing a thing, should it be a thing as well? Because actually, I think we've all, we had a chat earlier, and we were all like, \"yeah, fair play\".\nJC: I think if you can, if they can figure out how to get to the leadership level that they're all wanting to get to and not do the messy middle bit, then kudos to them. Honestly, the reality is nobody wants to do that bit. Nobody ever wanted to do that bit because you're right, you get all of the pressure, lower paid, you know, everything's coming to you from below and above, but you've kind of got to work through it. But I know we were having a conversation earlier, saying this also plays into the \"I want it, and I want it now\", moving around and that's not generational. I think that's multi-generational. Yeah, I don't think it's got anything to do with what year you were born. I think it's, it now has to do with where do I want to get to? The market's a bit tight. I'm probably not going to get to that role. I need to earn a bit of money because my mortgage has gone up. So, I think, you know it's a clever article. Is it a \"thing\"? I don't think it's a thing. I think it's just a nice clever article, but if it is a thing, I want it, I want part of it. So, just saying, I'm going to hedge my bets if conscious unbossing does turn out to be a \"thing\", I'm going to say I talked about it on this podcast.\nDDS: Excellent. You're an early adopter. Caroline, is it a \"thing\"? Should it be a \"thing\"?\nCR: Well, I think it's always been there. You know, when you're 21 years old, what is sexy about \"Oh, I want to be a middle manager\"? I think that it's a really useful step. Get some management training in and some experience in having those difficult conversations, get it in early. But you know what's exciting? You know, at that time you want to be the CEO. There's so much stuff about, if you're watching Succession, you don't want to be the person who's doing the governance reports at the end of the meeting, you know, it's you want to do something exciting very often, at that age and it's just human nature. So, it's not a \"thing\".\nDDS: But it is a critical role, isn't it? And I think it's a difficult role because you don't have the agency that you'd have in a senior role. You don't have the pay that you'd have in a senior role. You also don't have the ability to just switch off at the end of your day because you're taking care of people's well-being, taking care of people's development, and often you're relied upon to fix those kind of things.\nJC: I think it's an important step. You've kind of got to do it in order to, I'm not really sure how you can become a leader if you haven't worked through that middle management piece and learned your trade.\nDDS: Mel, final thoughts on this?\nMS: At the Uni this week, they get polled on, you know, what do you want to get out of the degree this year. And actually, one of the topics was about how do you manage people at work, how do you lead people. And when they were asked, \"Oh, what does that mean?\" Some of their experiences where they've had to do group activity and then been the lead, I guess, in that group, how badly it's gone. And one of them quoted, \"Yeah, because they just didn't do what I asked them to do\", which made me chuckle. Oh, welcome to our world, that sense of things. And you know, it was a genuine thing. So, A, I liked they're asking, let's have the conversation about it. B, I don't, you know, you can't go through life not doing it. C, maybe it's one of those things that we need to bring back. I mean, it was a big thing when you joined the workplace if you wanted to get on, there was brilliant management development, you know, and stages you used to be able to go through and it felt hard, but it felt like you were being, you know, supported within that journey, whereas now people just seem to get pushed into those types of roles. So, maybe they're seeing more of that, you know, and maybe not the supported side of it. And it's a big thing for us in HR, right? Because if you don't get that piece right, we know it falls on HR to either deal with it when it goes wrong, or we end up filling that void where you don't have good enough management. So, we can encourage them that you can get a lot out of it. But I'm also really aware, I think, when times get tough in businesses and budgets get pushed, you've got to do more with less. There's huge pressures on people. It can feel incredibly, hybrid working, all of these things that have come about, you know it, it's hard to manage people for sure.\nDDS: I guess the overall tip from everyone is don't do middle management as a side hustle, that's probably the worst combo of all those things, isn't it? So, I'd like to say so much thanks to our guests today, Jo, Caroline and Mel. We've got a wealth of resources available for you to support you at any point and, as I mentioned at the top of the programme, we've concentrated this month on conflict. You'll find a lot on there and sexual harassment. We've also just launched our new Resourcing and Talent Planning report, and we've touched on some of the kind of headline figures from that and some of the trends. Publish new episodes of this podcast every fortnight, so make sure to follow or subscribe wherever you listen to us and catch up with anything on demand and keep sharing on the community. There's a lot of stuff happening, and the brilliant news is that it's all good. My name's David D'Souza, and this has been the HR People Pod. Thank you very much.\nAre RoboCop-style security guards and AI accountants a glimpse of the future of work? Are longer hours more likely to be the norm, especially if you want to progress in your career? What are the differing perceptions and attitudes of a multigenerational workforce and how is this giving rise to the purported trend of 'conscious un-bossing'?\nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Mel Steel, former HR director and interim people and transformation leader; Jo Carlin, senior VP HR Europe and global head of inclusion and diversity at Firstsource; and Caroline Roberts, associate non-executive director at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University NHS Trust.\nRecorded: 27 September 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 8: Benefits| Location tracking | Shadow policies | Sexual harassment\nDuration: 00:33:54\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting the profession and the world of work. My name is David D'Souza, I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD. And joining me in the studio we have:\nDanny Mortimer: I'm Danny Mortimer. I'm the Chief Executive of NHS Employers.\nJanet Campbell: Oh, sorry Janet Campbell, I'm the HR Director for the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority. Got to pay attention.\nDDS: Brilliant. Thank you, we have Janet back for the second time, which is why she's so relaxed and chilled. And also, our third guest today is:\nAmanda Arrowsmith: Hello. I'm Amanda Arrowsmith, I am the People and Transformation Director for the home team at the CIPD.\nDDS: You work for the CIPD?\nAA: I do work for the CIPD.\nDDS: That must be a nightmare. What's that like?\nAA: It's lovely. I get to do HR at the heart of HR. I love it.\nDDS: Absolutely. And you, obviously, get the rare privilege of working with me and we'll come on, a bit later in this show, to actually talking about the things that organisations should really be advertising as benefits when they're trying to attract employees. And the CIPD obviously have that as a unique selling point.\nDM: Very unique.\nDDS: Unique, kind of in inverted commas. I want to start the show as we normally do, by going around asking people what they've been watching, reading, consuming recently. But before we do that, I just wanted to give a brief overview of today's show. So, we're going to try and split it up into two parts today and that's because I think they necessarily have to be very tonally different. So, we're going to spend the first portion of the show talking about, as we normally would, things that are coming up in the news more broadly. But the second part, we want to have a conversation around sexual harassment in the workplace. So, one, I want to flag that up for people so that if they wanted to avoid that section they could, or if they wanted to, kind of think about how they're going to approach listening to it, they can, but secondly because that will explain why, as I say, it will be probably a very different tone to the conversation there. But we think it's an important one that needs to happen. So, before we launch into the fun bit. Well actually, at the start of the fun bit, let me frame it that way. Danny, what have you been listening to, reading, consuming at the moment? You can either go for, as some guests do, this is the most impressive thing I can think of, or you can be honest with us.\nDM: Because I've been away this week and sitting my hotel room, I watched a documentary called \"Storm Foretold\", which is about a guy called Roger Stone who was an adviser to Donald Trump when he was president. And US politics, is really, really topical, I'm quite interested in US politics in particular. So yeah, it's a fantastic documentary. It's a fantastic documentary because Roger Stone is the most remarkable character. The way in which the documentary plays out and is filmed, it's really remarkable because the documentary-maker and Roger Stone become quite close. But it is a truly disturbing picture of what happened, and particularly what happened on January the 6th and the role that Roger Stone played in kind of making that happen. It's a more interesting watch than I'm probably making it. But yeah, I'd, that's the thing I've enjoyed the most, recently.\nDDS: So, we'll take that as a strong recommendation, thank you. Amanda?\nAA: I have nothing quite so highbrow. I am delighted to say that last weekend the NFL is back, and so my weekend last weekend was watching NCAA college football, \"Go Irish\", and then following that up with NFL Sunday in our house, which becomes lovely apart from the two times a year that my team, the New York Jets, play my husband's team, the Miami Dolphins, when we watch the games in separate rooms because the rivalry is fierce and for many years my team were in the ascendancy and better than his team and would beat his team, and that hasn't happened for the last couple of years. So, it's hard, it's a hard season, but it's a good season.\nDDS: And for anyone who's not familiar with the game, NFL Sunday is where you have a massive ice cream whilst watching the game.\nAA: Exactly. That's exactly what you do, yeah.\nDDS: That's excellent. That's fantastic. And Janet, what have you been watching or reading?\nJC: So, I'm going to say two things if I'm allowed, I have just finished reading a book called \"Fingertips\", which is the third in a book series called \"Courageous Love\" by an author called Terreece M. Clarke. It's a bit spicy, I love it.\nDDS: Bit spicy!\nJC: There's a bit of spice in it and I couldn't wait. I was really waiting, and I literally read through the night because I couldn't put it down, love it. And then I started watching a series on Netflix called \"The Perfect Couple.\" Nicole Kidman stars and Liev.\nDM: Liev Schreiber\nAA: Liev Schreiber, yeah. And I'm only one in and I'm thinking, \"oh, this is going to be really good. It's about massive, big society wedding in a wonderfully state, in Nantucket, I think, and a body, a dead body washes up on the shore, so everyone becomes a suspect. So, I think it'll be quite intriguing, and I think there's going to be, based on the first one, a bit of in and out, each person's story will be told through it. So, I'm looking forward to watching, getting into that.\nDDS: Excellent, yeah, murder mysteries and whodunnits have, kind of really made a comeback. I'm going to drop two recommendations. One is, in the last podcast, I think, I referenced, later into the podcast, \"Women, Money, Power\" by Josie Cox. Who is a friend of mine but didn't give me a free copy. So, if she's listening, still slightly bitter about that, Josie. But that's a really interesting, kind of overview and examination of the history of some really important tales of the relationships between women, money and power. But I've also been reading, less seriously, the book around the creation of the film \"Airplane.\" It's a comedy that's aged perfectly in some places and less well in others but is absolutely hilarious. And you may say, \"surely you must have read that before.\" And I'll say to you, \"I haven't read it before and don't come on the show\" Thank you. But there's a lovely story in it and I think it's something actually appropriate for workplaces in terms of commitment versus vision. So, general principles apply today, as they always do, which is we will talk in generalities around things. So, we may mention an organisation, but if you're working in that organisation, I swear we're not having a pop at you, we're using you as a jumping-off point for something that we hope is of more value to the profession at large. So, the first thing we're going to kick off is talking about workplace benefits. We recognise that every organisation would like to be advertising that I work there, however only five or six can maybe do that at any one point in time. So, there's a story in people management referencing the fact that almost half of current UK job vacancies list a statutory right as a workplace benefit and a good example of that is an instance of an organisation listing free water as a perk, possibly access to oxygen as well. Our own research at the CIPD highlights the need for clarity in what organisations and employers see as a benefit, but I think we were more ambitious with that, which is helping organisations think around total reward, how you invest in people's development as well. But I was really curious, just to go round, what do you think as a group and individuals, really attracts people to working at your organisation and what do you think's, I guess, the most desperate thing you've ever seen or what do you see, if you were to see it in an advert yourself, you'd go \"well, that's not really saying much\".\nJC: Well, I think it's not so much if you're offering free water as a benefit. Although, jokes aside, I do wonder whether back in the days of austerity, lots of organisations stripped out a whole load of benefits, you know, free teas, coffees, whatever, whatever. It all got stripped out, right? Because people were trying to save money wherever they could and lots of organisations became hair-shirted about all of that, and some of them still are. So, free water might well be a great perk. Actually, I think for me, it's about trying to just have a rounded view of what you're going to get when you come here. I know some of them are statutory, but if you didn't have it, I don't think you'd get as many people applying for jobs, free water aside. I do think you have to list out as much as you can because it's part of what makes you an organisation, what makes people attracted to you. I just think if you only listed the things that were beyond statutory, you'd see a massive drop off in applications. It might be. I don't know you think, Danny, but.\nDM: I suspect you're right. I think the majority of the working population probably don't know what the law guarantees them in terms of their holiday entitlements and everything else, and that's not just people entering the job market for the first time. I suspect, in my sector I did, I did log on just to check actually. I mean, I was surprised at how little we sometimes said about the benefits we do have, which are often in excess of the statutory. But yeah, I would think that it's there is a role for it. It's not as maybe as sinister as people.\nDDS: So, that's another interpretation might be, kind of, you're educating people.\nDM: Yeah.\nDDS: And you're helping them go, \"look, if you were to work here, this, this is it and some of that will be above and beyond and some of that will be\".\nDM: Yeah, and we have to accept that are some jobs that you don't get, that. You're a gig worker, you get very little. At least for the time being, who knows if that will change in the coming months and years. And there are plenty of parts of the economy where that will be true for some people.\nAA: And I think you're right. I think the, it's easy for us because we live and breathe it. So, we know what the benefits are we know what the statutory is. I agree most people probably wouldn't know what all that is and actually listing it helps people to make those decisions. So, actually listing what we might consider that, I don't know the 20 to 25 (inaudible 09:15). Whatever it is, actually helps them to make decisions about roles and what they're doing. I think the interesting thing for me, about the other point you were saying, was around we're seeing more interest in that personalisation of work. So, many years ago, we saw big rise in flexible benefits and people having their choice in what benefits they wanted and that kind of has, has gone off a bit, but it's coming back. There's some really interesting research being done out of UI. Where they're looking at personalisation in work. And that's not just around benefits, it's around contracts, it's around how you work. And so that's quite an interesting concept for me. I was asked just yesterday by someone who we were talking about parental leave and perhaps some changes that might be coming, frankly, and someone else was saying \"can we include it for dogs?\" Because they don't have children, but they do have a puppy, and they would have liked some time off. And I know that there are organisations that have given time off for puppies and helped people to have puppy leave and those sort of things and so it is interesting about what's important to someone because it's not the same for everyone is it? It is different about what's important to people.\nDDS: I genuinely, when you said that I was like, \"why would dogs need time off?\"\nAA: It's very hard working with people, David, so you need time off.\nDDS: But how do you work out how much you have to pay them? What's the reference period? There's a lot of (inaudible, 10:25) for me in that bit. So, moving on from benefits, but talking probably about, I think something very linked to that individual choice piece, but I think there's some really interesting arcs actually and cyclical pieces in some places around individualistic practices and work versus solving for a collective and the role of the individual and obligations of it, compared to the organisation. I know where everyone in this room is today, because they're here within a couple of metres of me, but some employers are starting to wonder more and more about where their people are and planning to start monitoring employee working locations in a bid to police or enforce their hybrid working strategies. Whenever we talk about hybrid work, I just want to be really clear, the reason we talk about it is: one it is topical, secondly, it's topical because it's a sea change for a large percentage of people. Equally, at the same time, and it will definitely come up today, we recognise that for many people their choice of work, just work location certainly isn't just there in the same way. So, for lots of people, it's \"as you were\", for many other people it's a fundamental change in the way they think about work, which is why we cover it. So, a number of media outlets revealed the PWC has informed its UK employees that it will begin monitoring office attendance as part of a stricter hybrid policy. Individual working location data will be shared monthly to ensure fair application of the policy. A PWC spokesperson was quoted as saying, \"employees who do not comply with the three-day policy will be asked to explain, seeking an informal resolution without formal disciplinary action\". So, genuinely curious to get your thoughts on this. We know that some organisations would like people in more but are struggling to find a way to make that happen. Is this a good way of doing it? Is this something that organisations should be examining more of? Danny, I'm going to start with you because I know your starting point might be different.\nDM: Yes, and in obviously, in my sector, the vast majority, not everybody, but the vast majority of people do need to be in the workplace. And that's been a constant over recent years because it's quite hard to do, you know, to do some of the more hands-on things.\nDDS: Surgery over Teams is quite tricky.\nDM: Surgery on Zoom is not a straight-forward prospect, no. And whilst, you know, there are things that we need to look at about making my sector more agile and moving more into that hybrid space and we're doing work with the University of Sussex and others to look at that, through a programme called Agi Lab. It, until you raised the question, I'd never really thought about how you tracked those things. Yeah, I kind of, I kind of get the setting an expectation bit, I do understand that. Business, business like that and lots of other businesses are about particularly supporting clients and clients probably have expect, are increasingly having expectations about people being on site to do things. I guess the kind of the role of technology in tracking people, it does make me feel uncomfortable.\nDDS: I can see you shuffling in your seat.\nDM: Yeah, it does make me feel uncomfortable, and also we are also a pretty heavily unionised sector, and I, you know, I'm sort of partly thinking, \"Well, gosh, how would my trade union colleagues respond to that idea, that we are using technology to track their members?\" and I think that would be a complicated conversation to have. So, yeah, I don't know enough about it because it's not a particular issue in my sector, but it, I must admit to a kind of, a slight sense of unease.\nDDS: Janet?\nJC: I think the slight sense of unease is where I am with it all. And again, I'm sure there must be some underlying data that we don't, we haven't seen. We've just seen this article about what they're going to do and there's some underlying data that says to them this is the right thing to do for our organisation, for our employees. But if I was an employee, I might feel a little, a bit uneasy about it, and I might be asking, \"Why? What will be different? What output will be different if I'm in the office versus working from home? Am I not trusted to be in the right place for delivering this task?\" If I can use that phrase? So, I'd sort of, I'd want to question the kind of culture then that my organisation is trying to create or move to if that were the new thing. I can see you nodding.\nAA: Yeah, that's where I went to. I was kind of thinking about values alignment and most organisations have trust as one of their values, but we're going to start using your clocking-in data to check that you are actually going through the hoops. It sounds like a line manager problem to me, not a problem.\nJC: Yeah.\nAA: And actually, unfortunately, a lot of what we come back to is. You know, if you want people to come in, give them a reason to come in, tell them why you're doing it, be open about that \"why\" And sometimes that \"why\" might be, we want to get together, we want to check the standards of work, we, you know, we want to, we know that for people earlier in their careers, actually sitting with other people and being together really helps you to develop that work, and we get that but also we know that we can make sure that our clients are getting what they need. Because it's client site or own site, I believe, I was reading, you know, we can check all of those things. But what does it say about your values if you're going to start using technology to track that data rather than actually having honest conversations with people and using your line managers to build that and trust that. It's an interesting one, it's not new, we've all, we know we've had like clocking-in systems for years, haven't we? I wonder if it's because there is a struggle for the the working population, where people have gone hybrid or come back and because it wasn't hybrid, it was fully remote for a period of time and I think a lot of us in that situation are struggling with the, \"How do we get that back in? How do we help with our culture?\"\nJC: And I get that, and you know, there's no doubt that we've lost something, right? In terms of how teams gel together, spontaneity and so on. It's very difficult to be spontaneous if you've got to schedule a Teams call, right? So, I do understand that there is something to be gained from encouraging people to be in the office a bit more often, but I'm just wondering whether, just because you can track them with technology whether you ought to? Is there a different way of doing that?\nAA: I think for people professionals as well, and I know we're not talking about resilience today, but we have at CIPD, we've issued some work recently around how you can support people professionals with their resilience and their own well-being. I was chatting to some people in my team and in the past, we would see someone, and we'd go, \"are you all right?\" and you'd have that conversation. Whereas now we only find out about a thing when it's an issue.\nJC: Yeah.\nDDS: True.\nAA: The, this level of things that we're dealing with and that, kind of, that impact, it's always when something's an issue or something's got to a point that it needs someone, rather than actually before.\nJC: Yeah.\nDDS: Regular listeners will know that we've got a section called, \"Is it a thing?\" where we take a workforce trend that we might have seen trending or it's been covered in either a high-end or a less high-end newspaper and say, \"Look, is that actually really happening in the world?\" We're shifting a little bit today because we want to talk about something that probably sits behind some of these things, which is the notion of shadow policies. So, last time we spoke about something where you would only really know about it, I think, which is people kind of taking secret annual leave whilst pretending to work, and we talked about, well it would be difficult to monitor the incidence of that because no-one's ever going to tell you. So shadow policies, for anyone who doesn't know, are policies that are enshrined by being written down. But maybe the working practice is different. So, a good example used to be, if you asked IT departments whether they allowed WhatsApp for communication, they'd say, \"Absolutely not. That's not thing we have\", but then you'd find that almost everybody in the organisation was using it and IT knew about it. So, you've got a really different kind of what we say we do and what we actually do sitting there. So, we wanted to talk about how prevalent, I guess people think shadow policies are in different spaces and any examples that you've had of them where you go, \"Yeah, we say that. But actually, we probably don't do that.\" And Amanda, you're giggling, so I'm going to start with you.\nAA: I think back to early in my career where no-one worked after 4 o'clock on a Friday. We all did, everyone, you know, the contract said we did, and we were open and the poor receptionists all would have to be there. I was working at a law firm, no-one worked after 4 o'clock on a Friday. If you needed to find someone, you'd go to All Bar One, and that's where you'd find them. So that's\nDDS: As late as 4 o'clock?\nAA: As late as 4 o'clock?\nDDS: I'm impressed.\nAA: It was Leeds, it was the 90s, All Bar One hadn't been open that long in Leeds. It was early. But it's really interesting, I wonder why we're naming things? Is it not just treating people fairly, is it not just give and take? So, \"Oh, I've got an opportunity to do this. Great. I know you go over and above\". It's difficult if you're working shift work and if you're working in a team. But if you're in those situations, and I suspect we've all seen it. The risk, I guess, is favouritism.\nJC: Yeah.\nAA: But the shadow policy's a thing.\nJC: It's not a thing, it's not a thing. It's always been, you've always.\nDM: It's not a new thing.\nJC: It's not a new thing, it's not a new thing. Shadow policies have always happened. You know, you have a policy and, you know, you think about a policy as being, you know, a framework and some people operate slightly outside of that but as long as you're broadly consistent in it, is it a thing?\nDM: And it's sometimes it's about the ability of the organisation to change the policy, \"that's a stupid policy.\"\nJC: Yeah.\nDM: And, as HR professionals, we've all had moments where we've had.\nDDS: Perish the thought.\nDM: On a policy where, you know, as soon as they, yeah, they just don't survive any contact with reality.\nJC: Yeah.\nDM: And sometimes it is that ability to just change policy.\nJC: Change it, I agree, I agree.\nDM: And, you know, having those kind of feedback loops and everything else, whether it's through managers or through trade unions or whatever it may be, being willing to change policies. And sometimes policies, kind of have this almost holy, \"We can't change the policy. You know, it's only reviewed every three years.\" You improve the policy to reflect the practice, and the sensible practice in the organisation.\nDDS: So, we're going to move on. And as I said at the start of this, we're going to talk about sexual harassment in the workplace. For many practitioners that will bring back bad memories and potentially many people have been impacted by it directly as well. So, we'll be conscious of that as we go through. I want to flag it up really clearly, that is the conversion that we're having, but we think it's a really important one to have. So we are, at the CIPD, focusing on conflict in the workplace this month. Next month you will see more material coming out from us around, in the UK, the Making Work Pay policies the Government's new range of policies. And separate to that from, we know from October 2024, the Worker Protection Bill will be coming in, which is an amendment of the Equality Act in the UK. For anyone listening, it's the Equality Act, it's not the Equalities Act. I just want to pick up on that because it's really a marker of whether you should be in some conversations or not as to whether you understand that, but it will strengthen existing protection for workers against sexual harassment and placing slightly different duties on employers around reasonable steps. Now, there was an interesting example of an organisation attempting to mitigate risk around its parties, events, kind of celebratory things for staff recently. What they said is, \"you can drink alcohol, you can drink free water,\" obviously, we've covered that. \"But you can drink alcohol only if you have a sign-off from your line manager.\" And that's an example of a policy designed, I think, to try and reduce risk whilst placing the onus on the line manager and making it quite a strange discretionary call. Amanda, I'm going to come to you first. How do you risk assess? How do you manage, not only I think the obligations that you have in law, but I think more importantly, how do we reduce what steps the organisation is saying, reduce the instances of and the likelihood of sexual harassment in the workplace.\nAA: So, I think where I believe we need to start is with that awareness-raising and with training. So, it's about setting the standards but making sure that everyone is aware of those standards and knows what is and what isn't acceptable. But also, if there is a complaint, if there is an issue that they will be heard, that that can be, that will be dealt with and unfortunately, we do need to have policy to make sure people are really clear and how that can be dealt with. And give people the tools that equip them to do that. But it requires you to create a psychologically safe environment where people can say things and can raise concerns, but also, it's just about us as leaders calling it out. It's about us recognising behaviour, however small that might be and actually being brave enough to call that out. And that's difficult. Earlier in my career, would I have called stuff out? No, I probably wouldn't, and I probably didn't because there's a power imbalance and I'm scared of it. But what we have to do is make sure that we are creating the environment where it's clear what's acceptable, but also if there is an issue, how can we support people to raise those issues and sort them out.\nDDS: Sorry, if I can just push you on that a second.\nAA: Yeah, sure.\nDDS: So, there's a cultural piece and my guess is a lot of the conversation we have will be around that, that specific point around risk assessment.\nAA: Yeah\nDDS: How would you go about that? So, summer party, what are your thoughts? Where are you seeing the risk in that? What's the best way of managing that while still keeping it celebratory?\nAA: So, partly that's about people taking responsibility for their behaviours and for the behaviours of others. So, when you're risk assessing, you would go through your process for your risk assessment to start off with and that would be identifying. So, the risks of 60 people who haven't been together for a long time, all coming together at a free bar, potentially, and thinking they can drink as much as they can in two hours and then there might be some canapes. And how, you know, how do you support that, how do you do that? And partly that has to come from before that. So, you mitigate that risk by being clear of what that understanding is. The other thing is, if you're, in your risk assessment, and as part of the new law in the UK, you will be required to do sexual harassment risk assessments. If in your risk assessment, you're identifying that you don't want to put a particular person in a situation or your mitigation is to not have someone getting a lift with someone else, you've got a bigger issue there and you need to deal with that bigger issue.\nDDS: Yeah.\nAA: Bravely, sorry.\nDM: No, no, I'm agreeing with you entirely and I think there is always a risk for us as a profession that when the law lands, it becomes a kind of mechanistic approach to risk assessment. And we think it's about events, it's about Christmas parties and it's about those kind of things. It's not, you've got to step back. As Amanda said, it's actually, you've got to take several steps back and say, \"Are we clear about? Do we accept there's a problem.\" And in every, you know, we have to start accepting that there is a problem. And actually, some organisations I think do struggle to accept that there is a problem in their workplace because people haven't raised concerns because they haven't felt able to raise concerns. So, you've got to accept there's a problem and then there is something about leaders setting some standards and then that informs the risk assessment then about specific events. It's just a function of actually, this is what we will tolerate as an organisation, this is how we will deal with this, this is how we will educate you. These are the behaviours we will and won't accept and I think there is also a point about that kind of education about acceptability in particular, I know, Janet, we've talked about this previously.\nJC: Yeah. So, I think I agree with all of that and think that when all is said and done, risk assessment, you're dealing with people and you can never predict how people are going to react and behave in a given set of circumstances, irrespective of the policies and procedures and all of the prior risk assessments that happen because people just react and respond in certain situations. So, I think, at the heart of all of this, there's got to be something about trusting. Trusting, if I feel or that I have been harassed, whether that's a micro-harassment or something much more significant, because often we don't recognise harassment when it's micro, we only recognise it when it's big and significant. We've got to create environments where people feel they trust that if there is harassment, regardless of the scale of the harassment, I will be heard, and someone will take me seriously when I raise this issue. And then because we're going to create the conditions for that to happen, which is where you come back to then, full circle, back to your your assessment, your policies, what's the organisation culture?\nDM: And there is a risk, and this is something we've got to be aware of, I think in our organisations you've got to be aware of as a professional body. That the conversation always starts with the Christmas party. It always starts with alcohol. And in our sector, we're increasingly talking about that point Amanda made about safety, about sexual safety. This is a daily, daily issue, it's not a once-a-year issue. The sector that's done the most work in the health service on this, it's the ambulance service and some colleagues there have have done some really terrific work. And actually, you know, I think what they've highlighted in particular is that, particularly women who are in a real minority in the ambulance service, there's a real prevalence of both sexual harassment and sometimes sexual assault. The paramedics, their colleagues that are behaving in that inappropriate way, aren't drunk. These are things that are happening daily in ambulances, in other working environments, and we've got to have that conversation as a profession, we've got to have that conversation in our workplaces, with our boards about the reality of that experience, for all people, but particularly for women. I think that's something that we've got that opportunity to do that in the lead up to the act.\nJC: Because in the, there aren't many workplaces where alcohol is involved nine to five, right? So, I think it's, in my view it's slightly disingenuous to start the conversation about the Christmas party or the summer party because, you know, if you're afraid of getting in the lift with somebody or you don't want to be caught in the coffee point with someone.\nDM: Exactly.\nJC: Or you don't want to have a one-to-one one meeting with someone, that's got nothing to do with alcohol or the Christmas party, and we've got to have those honest conversations and create the space to do that.\nDDS: Absolutely, and it's worth saying that I think the focus goes on those events because there's quite often a spike. But it's the fact that it's the prevalence day-to-day and in fact the extreme prevalence of it that's challenge. Danny, I'm going to cheat on this because we need to close up, I think, in terms of time. You made a really important point when we were chatting earlier, that actually the organisational response to this needs to be right to enable the HR or the professional response to be right to this.\nDM: Yeah.\nDDS: So, I'm going to come to Amanda, actually to, kind of, have a final thought, which is, what's it like when it hits your desk? Because we've all been there, when you get that call out of the blue or someone sets up a meeting and you don't know what it is and then suddenly, you're very aware of what it is. But the, I think the point that Danny makes is that, yeah, it has to work within a system because actually, if you know what the right thing is to do, but the response you get from the organisation is pushed back or undermining the victim or the work that you might want to do around it, it's really difficult. But just because we'll have lots of people who maybe haven't reached the unfortunate bit of their career where this is something that they have to deal with, and it is hugely difficult and hugely draining. Could you just talk us through, I suppose about, if you were to receive a complaint today, let's say, around a senior member of staff, because quite often that is, it's the power imbalance which we kind of referred to. How does it feel and what do you do?\nAA: So, let's start with how it feels. Even if you're not new in your career, you haven't dealt with it, it still makes your stomach drop because we genuinely believe that people are good. And so, when this comes up and someone raises something, your initial reaction is that pit of the stomach, I have to deal with this, because we're also employees, we also have relationships. And we're having to deal with someone, potentially, in power. So, recognise that, it's real, it still happens we all have that. In terms of how you deal with it, the first thing to do is make sure that people are not in harm's way. And that might mean making some difficult decisions. That might mean going to your Chair of your board, that might mean going to a CEO if it's someone senior, that might mean removing people from situations. But the most important thing is that you remove that harm, and that's where you have to start. You've got to do things in a way that becomes really challenging because you need to balance fairness and equity. And until you've done an investigation, you have to be really careful about making assumptions and how that works, as you would with any potential grievance or disciplinary. Where it comes to sexual harassment, it's that harm piece and how you protect people from that harm. So, you have to take that extra. You need to work fast, but with detail. You need to be calm. You need to be clear. You need to follow all those things that you will have learned many years ago and make sure you're taking notes, make sure. Keep it small. Speak to people that need to be spoken to.\nJC: Yeah.\nAA: Just because someone's been brave enough to bring an issue to you doesn't mean they want everybody knowing about it.\nJC: Yeah.\nAA: Respect that confidentiality, work with people. But first things first, make sure there's people that have, don't have any more risk of harm. I hope that's helpful.\nDDS: No, really helpful, thank you. And it's multi-dimensional for the victims and I think that's a point that we need to make, that it's not just an incident. I was fortunate to be able to help someone a couple of years ago, going through this situation, but it was giving them advice about how to work with their HR team. The HR team did nothing wrong. Everything they told me about the way that team reacted was they were supported by this and all those things. But the level of jeopardy they felt for raising it, for the potential impact on their career. For, \"Am I making too much of a fuss about this? How are people going to see me?\" Everything from, \"What if I don't get promoted any more?\" To, \"If I do get promoted, how do I know it's not as a response to this?\" It's putting people in an almost impossible situation. It's worth remembering, as practitioners, sometimes the response you might get is to a bundle of things going on for people in a horrific situation rather than the way that you're handling it as a professional. So, that's all from us for today and I really appreciate all of your openness on that topic in particular, but I'd like to thank our guests, Amanda, Janet and Danny for sharing your thoughts on a breadth of topics today, and as ever, to you, our listeners.

I'm David D'Souza and this has been the HR People Pod, stay safe and well until next time.\nIs free water really an 'employee benefit'? Would you track employees' working locations to enforce stricter hybrid working policies? And would you turn a blind eye to 'shadow policies'? In this episode, we debate these questions and also discuss the preventative measures organisations should take to reduce the risk of sexual harassment incidents in the workplace.\nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Danny Mortimer, chief executive at NHS Employers; Janet Campbell, director at Restoration & Renewal Delivery Authority; and CIPD People and Transformation Director Amanda Arrowsmith.\nRecorded: 13 September 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 7: 'Great Retention' | Organisational vision | 'Office peacocking'\nDuration: 00:38:21\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza:  Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting the profession and the world of work. My name is David D'Souza. I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD and joining me in the studio we have:\nJon Dawson: Jon Dawson, Chief People Officer from Lore Group.\nJo Carlin: Jo Carlin, SVP for HR Europe from Firstsource.\nJane-Emma Peerless: Jane-Emma Peerless, Director of People for Caxton Payments.\nDDS: Wonderful. Absolutely delighted to have you here today. Tell us a little bit about yourself before we get going. So, what have you been watching, reading, broadly consuming that might give us an insight into your life, Jon, if I start with you.\nJD: Watching everything about Oasis, I'll come back to that later on. What am I reading at the moment? Big fan of, and I know it's bit traditional, Stephen Covey's \"7 Habits\". I've been shopping a little bit and reading a great book, being from the hotel industry, called \"The Enneagram at Work\" by an amazing guy called Jim McFarlane. And it's all about how he uses that profiling of people within his career and there's some great stories in there about when he was GM and Kanye West turned up late. So, I can really relate to Hotel. So, I'm really enjoying that book again.\nJC: I mean, really, I haven't been reading anything quite so high brow.\nDDS: He hasn't either. He's just made that up. All right.\nJD: This is true. Honestly, it's the truth.\nDDS: He's read the back.\nJC: I've read some, you know, I can classify them as chewing gum for the brain-type novels. Yeah, which is just rubbish fiction interspliced with \"The man who mistook his wife for a hat\" by Oliver Sacks. Really great book about psychology, really fantastic. It's odd. Don't read it on the train, you get funny looks. And also, the psychopath test, again, not really a train-appropriate book, but all good.\nDDS: And that's Jon Ronson, isn't it? Really good?\nJC: Jon Ronson, awesome book\nDDS: Excellent\nJC: So, I've normally got about four books on the go, mainly because I forget where I put them, so I have to start another one and actually the one I'm, two that I'm really enjoying at the moment, one is called \"Slow Productivity\", by a professor Cal Newport, I think it is. Who is, he's a Professor of Computer Sciences in Georgetown, and it's, I think it's really interesting because it's all about what defines productivity in the cognitive world in, for knowledge workers, which no one has really been able to do. We talk a lot about productivity, and he tries to, I mean basically, what's the basis of his book is the fact we're all running out of steam. We're all getting burn out, we're all exhausted. And how can you find the time? How can you accomplish things well? And I think it really speaks to this whole idea about how, of pseudo-productivity, which is what we're seeing when people are going back into the office, probably. I don't know if it's a topic we're going to come on to, but a fascinating topic in its own right. So, that's so I'm interested to see where that, whether, what the answer is to that one. And the other is a great book called \"The Chronicles of a Cairo Bookseller\". About three women, 20-odd years ago, who set up a book shop in Cairo at a time when book shops didn't really exist and they set up a kind of Waterstones-type book shop and it's about their journey, their journey being three women in a men's world, the adventures they had, the issues they had and it's a brilliant read.\nDDS: Excellent. I thought you were going to say \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" for a bit.\nJEP: I did as well. I mean, the film was amazing, so maybe the book's good.\nDDS: Yeah, exactly that. I'm, yeah, I normally have three or four books on the go. I've actually lost track of what I'm reading. I'm going to reread \"The Jaws Log\" by Carl Gottlieb which is about the making of \"Jaws\". He was, kind of on set and he helped the screen writing, but it was such a chaotic process making that film that it's genuinely, for anyone who wants a good understanding of programme management, the things that you need to think about and the structure, it's a lovely way of bringing that to life. So, the fact that initially in Jaws, the plan was, when they bought the rights, to just train great white sharks to swim really close to people and then swim away because they didn't have enough understanding of what they were working with. It's just an act of, like utter genius that they managed to get that movie made.\nJEP: You're saying that, actually, people were killed on set because of it? I mean that would make me read the book.\nDDS: There's lots of stuff that comes quite close to that actually, so, no, absolutely wonderful read that I recommend from the archive. So, today we were going to do an Oasis-themed bit, genuinely, and someone's written a lovingly crafted, Kristian's lovingly crafted a script that said, \"we're just going to rock'n'roll with it, given news that rock band Oasis won't slide away without a reunion tour, and fans of the band can finally stop crying your heart out.\" However, we're not going to go into that in detail. Going to use that as a bridge to the fact that, bizarrely, I think, or possibly very much of our times. Even the fact that a band has said that it's going to come back, and it's going to go on tour has ignited debate on social media and aggressive stances. With people going \"this wonderful\", people going \"this is awful.\" Couple of reminders before we go into our next topic. It is possible to hold an opinion lightly and it is possible to not have a strong opinion on something and it is possible for people to feel different ways about things without one set of people being right and the other set of people being wrong and therefore not worth your time, which is where we're going to gracefully move on to talking about whether your business should be staying on X. So, the artist formerly known as Twitter. So, in recent years, this social media platform has become increasingly toxic, offensive and sometimes borderline unlawful, depending on where you sit. There's also an argument that it's there to exist for free speech, that people should be able to express views, that different parts of the world will have different tolerances for that. For organisations, there's a genuine decision to make about where you want to show up in the world, whether that might be a platform that you want to do it on. Where you say that it doesn't align with your values, but also then how do your values manifest in different spaces and what your customers would expect and what your people would? So, I think there's something really interesting happening there, but part of it actually is just around conflict and at the CIPD, we're going to spend next month, actually, talking about conflicting fact, by the time you hear this, it will be this month which is very exciting and bring all of our resources together to support practitioners. Without going into how you feel about Oasis, because Jon, I know you're particularly excited about that and that would just take up the whole half hour. But what do we think around that, kind of, manifestation on social media? Jane-Emma, I'm going to start with you.\nJEP: I was hoping you weren't going to start with me, actually, but I will carry on.\nDDS: I could see the fear in your eyes, and I went for it anyway.\nJEP: Yeah, I mean, I'm not on X. So, difficult to have a view from a personal point of view. I've tried it, I found it overwhelming, an inordinate distraction at the time. I did, I know that as a company we do have a couple of accounts, but mainly from a, sort of, as a customer outreach, customer support route. It barely gets used. I do know, I was talking to our marketing team, there's a nervousness about it, particularly at the moment because of all the changes going on, because of the change of ownership. That actually you might, there might be a sudden change, there might be a change of policy which actually then works against you and then suddenly you're stuck. So, I think there's a nervousness from businesses, certainly small businesses generally that you might commit to something on a social media channel, which suddenly either the rules change, it gets taken away or you don't know how much it's going to cost. So, I think there's a general nervousness around it and I really, I think other than politicians and journalists, I kind of can't see what the point is.\nJD: And for me, it's a really, it's a really an easy answer from an organisation perspective because actually we actually don't use it as a medium as well at Lore Group as in, I did a little bit of homework before and actually had a look and we have a page and I think it's got, like 25 followers. So, it's not something we proactively use anyway as a medium to promote our hotels or the industry around that and it's such a topical subject at the moment, that I think if, outside of Oasis and X, I think we could be here for two days talking about, about these two subjects alone. But certainly, for me, you know, I have my own account, you know. Everyone has an agenda whenever they're using X, whatever that may be, you know, whatever view you have of it and, for me, a lot of, we're having conversations, you know, with peers and you know various different people. And there's another theme for me that kind of stems off from this, and it's actually the actual trust in what we're actually seeing from a news reporting piece as well. And actually, people actually, you know, going on to the likes of X for, you know, is there another view to what you're actually seeing in the media that's being portrayed on TV and in news at the moment as well, which I think is a really, really interesting sort of area. So, I don't particularly have one view or the other on how you should use it or is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? I think it, I think it needs a lot more debate of where this goes, but it's certainly a huge subject at the moment.\nJC: I think we're in danger of over-thinking it, frankly. I think it's a social media channel, it's going to have people with opinions on it, to go back to your point, David, it doesn't mean that other people's opinions are right. You know, my view is having an opinion is great, being opinionated keeps you stuck. Let's be honest, it's probably had its day. And it's controversial for a reason. I think it's gone down that controversial route because it, I don't know, I'm not in the mind of Elon Musk, but I would imagine that that's playing into, you know, people using it. So, I mean we don't use it extensively at all and genuinely I think sometimes, you know, as organisations we can over-think these things. It does speak to a bigger issue, which is where do you get your news from and how much work are you doing to authenticate the sources of that news? I worked for a newspaper industry for 20 years and Financial Times being one of the core of that. And it was drilled into us about authenticity. And, you know, and I don't think enough people do question, these days, the sources of the information they're receiving.\nJD: I think anyone that uses Twitter/X as, as a medium is going to have their agenda and you've, kind of, got to question what is that agenda that you're seeing on there and you've, kind of, whatever you see on that medium, you've got to take a view of it may not be, you know, the real agenda that you're actually seeing, no matter what it is and, you know, it is becoming very, very blurred at the moment, you know, as in with what you're actually seeing on a wider news audience, media perspective as well. And I think, I think whatever you now see whether it be, you know, switching on the news or going on to X to look at a particular topic or something. I think you've really got a question actually what is the motive that you're actually seeing behind it. I travel a lot and see a lot of, you know, a lot of things in the US, especially the presidential campaign. You know, you switch on one news channel, and you see a certain view of the world and then the next morning I wake up, switch on another one and it's a very, very different story that's been told. And I think X is very, very similar to that in many ways as well.\nDDS: You know, there's a really good book actually by somebody who used to work in that space called Ryan Holiday that covers actually how you plant. It's kind of the other side of it, how you plant stories, how you develop a narrative, how you use shock value or mysteries to slightly influence an agenda. And it's one, I think for the, you know, we talk about the profession needing to be evidence-based, to your point as you are understanding what is likely to be true. And that goes down actually to, I would say more mundane, but actually more practical things. If you are doing something in your organisation, how can you be confident that that is the thing most likely to be effective? And if you are doing that because you saw headlines or you saw a conference speech or other things, that's less useful than actually a constructive kind of review of the different sources. And I think particularly when you get into making large investments and organisations, how you assess those effectively is key. So, we're going to move on to, and we've kind of lent into that media narrative piece and positioning it actually in the way that we're describing it, which is the next piece we're talking about is the idea that the so-called \"great resignation\", which was capturing media headlines a few years ago, has now become the so-called \"great retention\". And it does feel like everything needs to be \"great\" or \"quiet\" at the moment, they're kind of like the options presented to us. So, a story in The Sunday Times, noting that where the pandemic era saw chief execs grappling with worker shortages and other things. I have to say, they had quite a lot on their plate at that time and offering large pay rises to entice employees stay. We're now contending with a so-called \"great retention\" with many employees staying amid an economic backdrop that's pretty precarious. So, they're not confident enough to leave. So, our data at the CIPD shows the percentage of employees who had had less than one year's tenure has fallen from about 16% at the start of the year, from a peak of about 18% after the pandemic. And our labour market outlook in the spring, so that's a quarterly survey where we ask more than 2000 employers what it is their intentions are, anticipated that turnover and vacancies were both likely to decline in a period of normalisation. So, I guess there's a really practical question. What are you all seeing? Does it feel like it's tightening? Is that kind of borne out by that kind of headline? And also do we think this is a problem for firms, an opportunity, what do we think the implications are?\nJC: Well, I work in the outsourcing sector. Low attrition is amazing. Let's keep the low attrition trend. Let's go with you know.\nDDS: It's working for you? It's nice to hear.\nJD: I'm with you on this one as well.\nJC: It's working for us. Yeah. I mean, frankly, yeah, I'm all over this. this is brilliant. But on a slightly less glib note, it's cyclical, everything is cyclical. I think, when you've been in the profession for a length of time, you see things come and go, it's ebb and flow. I suspect what's happening now and we are seeing it, actually, in areas where perhaps we would have seen a little bit more attrition, we would have seen more churn. But in all honesty, people are staying put because they're not sure of what's going to happen. Everyone's a bit cautious and I think you know, look, have organisations become so reliant on people leaving that they're becoming, they've become a bit lazy and they're refreshing of the things that they would normally do, they're not getting that churn, so it just feels a bit stagnant. And I wonder whether there's just a little bit of that kind of stagnant pond-type feeling going on in businesses at the moment and there's no, you know, there's. It's always good, isn't it, when you get a bit of a refresh of your team sometimes, sometimes not. My team, obviously, if you're listening. But yeah, I wonder whether there's that at play as well. Everyone likes a, you know, a jazzy headline. So, if nobody's leaving, then they obviously must be staying, it can't obviously be because the organisations have just got better. Which I suspect they aren't.\nDDS: Or, like you say, there's something in the middle, so there's that notion of a healthy degree of attrition. Probably, you know, it helps probably individuals to move on as well. Normally, in terms of their career progression, we know that. Jon, thoughts from you?\nJD: I work in hotels and hospitality, so for me this is a great question because actually this week, last week at this time I was actually in Amsterdam doing a sort of a quarterly update with the senior team. And one of the data stats I was particularly keen to show was our retention rates because, we're on course this year, since, you know, since I've been with the group, to have our best retention rates that we've ever had as a group.\nDDS: And just to be clear, that's down to your amazing work and the conditions, yeah?\nJD: That is not down to my amazing work, that is down to a collective team strategy that we set out actually last year around that, and to back that up, we've got, you know, our NPS score is 14 points above the industry average. So, my sort of.\nDDS: If you're early in your career, by the way, take notes in this bit, right? Broad economic trend becomes Jon's work of excellence that's been planned for years.\nJD: So, my narrative last week was. \"Aren't we doing fantastic as a group?\" All of the strategies around retention, labour turnover, employee engagement. Because hospitality in general as an industry has had a really, really tough time, coming out of COVID, where you know the Brexit effect and we have seen huge levels of turnover as an industry and we purposely have set out a strategy you know, last year to work really, really hard. So, there's nothing that pleased me more, when I went into that meeting and then, you know, looking at some of those stats there on that there and like, well, at least we're sort of ahead of the market within hospitality. But I can absolutely say that, speaking with industry peers and peers within the people profession, that is those trends are definitely what we see and it is, I'm going to call it. For us, it's great to be stabilised. But it is absolutely helping us as an organisation, grow and develop a lot of people that maybe in years gone by were actually thinking I'm going to leave the industry and go and do something else. So, we're actually investing quite a lot in the development of people.\nDDS: Yeah, we had a chat probably about 18 months ago when it was a significant problem.\nJD: It was a huge problem.\nDDS: And I remember from the point of view of salaries, but also the other work you were doing, one it was really impressive, but secondly, I genuinely hadn't recognised some of those salaries that you were having to pay to, kind of, bring people in. Good careers available in that sector, if you'd like to get in touch with Jon?\nDDS: Jane-Emma?\nJEP: Well, I'm going to, I have to say I agree with both of you because I'm, we're enjoying a period of relatively, relative stability, which is lovely. And I can't say it's all down to our efforts, but I do think that I mean, well, let's face it a lot of this has come about because some of the very large recruitment companies who are listed on the Stock Exchange have had very bad results this year and they're putting that down to the fact that people aren't leaving, aren't moving. The work that we all had to do as businesses when the \"great resignation\" was going on, it made us all work much harder to look at our pay, our pay deals, look at the remuneration we were offering, look at the succession planning we were offering. I think those things have now been put in place and people are generally happier. Also, certainly in our sector, which is the tech sector, there have been a lot of companies that have gone to the wall. And suddenly people are nervous and going, \"Hmm, maybe we should just hang around a bit longer, we don't know\". All these companies that were backed through huge investments have run out of road and suddenly had to make huge cuts, mainly in staff, and I think it's made people more nervous. So, I'm hoping it's a combination. We'd like to think it's all the great work we've been doing, but I think it's cyclical. I think there's a lot going on around the scenes and it's, just let's enjoy it while it lasts.\nJC: Yeah, I agree with you. I think there's, we've got a headwind, haven't we? Let's be honest, we've got a little bit, or a tailwind. I can't remember which one's which actually.\nDDS: We've got wind, which we hope doesn't... You've got wins. Yeah, but we, we we're a... Which we hope doesn't come through our mics.\nJC: Bit we're a bit blessed at the moment, aren't we? But I do agree with you, actually. I think, the \"great resignation\", it does feel like a Western film, \"The Great Resignation\". It has, it sharpened the tool a little bit, didn't it? Made us look at things a bit differently and say, \"OK, what do we need to do differently? This is really hurting us and hurting our businesses.\" And I think there is substantially and certainly that's what I'm telling my organisation, that all the great work, coupled with, you know, a little bit of, of a helping hand from the economic environment.\nJD: You could also argue as well, there's many organisations that actually did focus, particularly this year, back end of last year on a lot of retention engagement strategies. You could argue that a lot of those coming to fruition are actually contributing to it. My Head of Talent, for example, we set him a really tough target this year around, you know, funnily enough, reducing any recruitment fees and we've not used any head-hunter fees, touch wood, this year at all. And he was super delighted.\nDDS: New global benchmarking data released by one of the employee experience platforms, Culture Amp, suggested that business leaders, including HR leaders, are facing an uphill battle to maintain confidence in their leadership as employees are more sceptical about companies' direction. So, our own research, the Good Work Index 2024 revealed that nearly four in 10 people didn't think that senior managers have got a clear vision for the organisation. So, there's a couple of things happening there, one: people being willing to voice that they're not convinced and secondly, a clear challenge for business leaders that actually that clarity of purpose and uniting people behind it in alignment is really important. We've just talked about, actually, pay as kind of a key driver, but actually that confidence that Jane-Emma raised in the future of the organisation is the key one as well. So, it would be really good to get some practical tips, I guess, rather than just observations, kind of, practical tips about what you think organisations should be doing. Jon, I'm going to come to you because you've obviously, you've kept everyone, no-one's left this year. Great job! Well done!\nJC: What's your secret, Jon?\nDDS: Tell us more.\nJD: We did have people leave, just for the record. I'm going to again wind the clock back to about two and a half years ago, when we actually looked at this as a subject matter as a group and what we actually did is, you know, we were very, very fortunate, we've got some beautiful hotels at Lore Group and that's not an advert, by the way. But we took all of our teams, our senior teams to Amsterdam. We actually looked at, you know, what the vision for the group should be and wanted to really build a strong set of values that would resonate in different countries, with different sort of demographics of people and we did a lot of kind of work around that. And one of the key themes that sort of stemmed from that is; how do you actually create something, you know, the vision and the values that someone, who's dealing with a guest, dealing with a customer can really relate to as simple as possible and not, as I call it, not over-HR it. And we did a lot of work around that and what we've actually seen, two years on, is that's kind of really landed and it was all about actually keeping that vision simple. But then actually coming up with programmes around when we launched \"here's the vision where we want to take the group?\" How do you actually do that change management piece? The training that comes around that, where actually every single employee can actually feel. It goes back to that, like Simon Senik, you know the why is in, how am I contributing to that? And I think many organisations sometimes maybe overcomplicate that too much. You know, as in, it's easier for us because we're not a huge, huge organisation. But you know, I was, took the family to Florida recently and Disney World. And if you walk round Disney World and you see what Disney does, you know, it's still got that magic of how it does that. So, it can be done on a huge, huge scale. But for me again, Disney's, super simple, every single employee that works there knows why they are on, their purpose. So, it's something that I feel that we're doing well at the moment, obviously, we can always improve but, but sort of that'll be my, sort of like, sort of \"top tips\", let's call it.\nDDS: OK, Jo, thoughts?\nJC: I think where you've got a huge organisation that's really global, I think it's difficult to do these kind of things from the ground up, but in organisations I've worked in where it's been slightly smaller, that's exactly what we've done. So, we've gone out and interestingly, it was for the hospitality company that I worked for, and we went out and we said to people, \"Look, what is it that makes working here so special? What is it that you think our purpose is? What is it?\" And we ran, you know, I ran workshops. I had a great time, frankly, I just toured around the country doing workshops. And out of it was born these guiding principles, because that felt more in tune with that organisation in particular. Although that was some years ago now, they're still using it because it's not, you know, it isn't, it wasn't born out of a bunch of execs sitting in a boardroom. It was born out of actually speaking to people who are doing \"the do\" in all sorts of walks of life in terms of their role at that organisation, and that was a great piece of work, I think, that really had an impact and effect. And I'd say, if you're in a small organisation, do that; don't be afraid to get out of the boardroom or the meeting room and go and run workshops and ask the question. You're left with a whole ton of work, but it's well worth it in the end and just get a fab, you know, a fabulous team that can actually do some analysis on it. In this organisation and in other global organisations, we've sort of gone down the route of culture, cultural playbooks, so a very strong vision, cultural playbook more focused on behaviours, because I think that sometimes we miss that, don't we? But that stripping it back to very, very, very simple behavioural statements, yeah? Which mean something to that organisation and each team can make their own. But I'm, you know, I suppose if I had my way and I had my choice, I'd always go out to the people and I'd always ask them. It took six months in that organisation, from start to finish. It's not fast job. So, it took six months, and you have to get through the conflicting views and you have to sell it at all levels. But it works. Everyone had a great time.\nDDS: Yeah, and it's worth saying, it's never tidy as well. So, we can explain all these things, kind of like top level, it's never tidy. You've got people who dissent, you've got people who you lose along the way, you've got contentious issues, you've got people. I remember years ago, working in an organisation where one of the values was \"Human\". I remember the COO standing up and going, \"Human is giving people the tough messages. Human is telling people exactly where they stand, so they are left in no question around that\". And the CEO came up next and he went, \"Human is about how empathetic we are.\" That's like, so what you've done is, you've got one word and as a leadership team, you're attempting to express that in two different ways and you're trying to get alignment from that. And it is it's, it's messy, this stuff, isn't it, right?\nJC: Yeah, it is messy but, but that's why you've got these behavioural, you know, what does it mean, broadly speaking? You are always going to get people interpreting it and you're going to get people. It's always going to be a bit aspirational. Some's aspirational, some is reality. But that's kind of, you know, that's the beauty of it, I guess.\nJEP: My question is, \"is there anything new here?\" Of all the customer, employee satisfaction surveys that have ever been done, that I've taken part in or have looked at the results from, the results are pretty similar: \"great people\", \"love the workplace\", \"love the products\", \"love the team\", \"love my job\", \"senior management don't know what they're talking about, they're useless.\" You know, that's pretty much a consistent message all the way through. So, I do think I, kind of, really feel for the senior teams here and being part of that, because there is a massive disconnect with the kind of issues you have to deal with at a really senior level and how people just get on with their everyday jobs and they can't understand everything that goes on. What I do think is really important, I think certainly, I mean and we're a small company, you know we've got, we don't have that many employees. We do try really hard, and you spoke about values. Values are, it all comes from the values, because if you're living and breathing your values and everybody understands that all the way through, they will feel much more comfortable with the direction the organisation is going in. And I would say that, coming out of the pandemic, I mean, it kind of implies that we went through a period of time when actually it was very clear that leadership that, you know, organisational vision was much better, it was easier to understand. The pandemic, I think, made us better at that. We had, there was so much uncertainty, we had to be really clear in our communication. We had to over-communicate all the time and we had to do it remotely, which was a challenge. And I think that post-pandemic, it's become much more difficult for businesses, particularly smaller businesses. Because, OK, we're over the the worst of it. But we're not really out of it yet. We're still living with the hangover of the loss of confidence within the, you know, within consumers particularly, cost of living crisis now has kicked in as well. People are not doing, are not following the typical patterns of behaviour they were pre-pandemic. So, businesses are struggling to find their new purpose and their new vision and their new direction. What I do think is really important is that you just have to keep communicating. So, we have a daily briefing call every morning with the entire company and we give everybody a chance to speak at that and we have a, we do our employee, we have an employee Rep. Group. So, even though we're a small company, everyone's got a voice, and I think giving people a voice is really, really important and to be honest, they will let you know if they're not happy, very quickly.\nJC: I agree and disagree because some of the stuff that I'm seeing is that there is trust and confidence in managers, so there is that \"we trust our managers, we're confident in our managers.\" I think the vision is slightly separate and I think your point around the pandemic is the thing that kind of sparked that thought. I think in the pandemic it was, it was easy to have a clear vision. It was easier to say, \"We're all lining up behind this\" because you had no other choice.\nJEP: It was survival, wasn't it?\nJC: Everything else, everything else was stripped away and I think now the pace of change, generally. I mean, you, if you come out tomorrow and say, \"this is it, this is our vision for the next five years.\" I mean, it's going to be out of date in six months. So, I think there's maybe some education around that and some, I don't know, some more honest conversations with workforces, with employees to say, \"look, hey, we don't have all the answers\" and we're doing a bit of that. But I think some of the time we're afraid to do that, aren't we, because we had the answers a few years ago.\nDDS: I think there's a degree and this is really unsexy, but it's about reducing asymmetry of information in organisations. So, to Jane-Emma's point, I think if people don't understand the complexity that the leadership are trying to deal with or they don't understand some of the other problems that may be happening in that system and you've only got one view of it, it's really easy to go, right essentially, to kind of, back-seat drive an organisation and go, \"I can see these problems. Why aren't they throwing resource at it?\" It's that connection, isn't it, between leaders need to understand what's happening, you know, on the frontline, what's actually happening in terms of customer interactions or whatever that looks like. But equally the more you can help people understand this is why we're making these decisions, because we've got to make choices. Final thing, we're going to talk about, we said we'd start a section in the podcast called, essentially, \"Is it a thing?\" where we unpack the latest trends or buzz word impacting the profession, things that you might have seen online. And this week's \"Is it a thing?\" and feel free to suggest \"things\" that you'd like evaluated by our panel of experts. Ruffling feathers this week, we'd like to introduce you to the concept of \"office peacocking\". That's the idea of making office spaces more attractive through aesthetic enhancements such as upgrading decor and adding amenities. That was a really difficult sentence to get through, by the way, I'm quite proud of that. But essentially making the office look more attractive in a bid to encourage greater attendance from staff. One, do we think that's a \"thing?\", secondly, do we think that's a sensible thing or are there more substantive things organisations might want to do if they do want their people in and around more. Jane-Emma, I'm going to come to you first.\nJEP: Yeah, I think it's doomed to fail.\nDDS: Doomed to fail! Doomed, doomed?\nJEP: Yeah. Doomed to fail. I mean, I the whole idea that you're going to get people back into the office because you've got a few nice, few chairs that have been improved or you've got a new coffee machine or something else. What you're talking about are people who've got very used to working remotely or working from home. They've probably, I mean, certainly when I talk to our guys, their home setup is probably better than in our office and our office is really nice. And asking them to make a choice about coming in and going through all the, sort of, the pain of commuting just because you might have a few improvements in an office. I just don't think it's going to hold water. I think it's doomed to fail.\nDDS: Doomed, so we have a \"doomed\" from this side. Jo?\nJC: I mean, I like nice things and so I'm more than happy for all of the offices to peacock, go for it. I think, you're right, it's not going to mean you're going to go in more. It's not going to mean people are going to go in more, but I think people like to work with people, yeah? People like to socially connect, that is never going to change. So, making those offices the best that they could be, you know, chuck in a Starbucks machine. If anyone's listening, that would be great. But you know, chuck in a Starbucks franchise even. Make it somewhere where, when people do go in to connect, it's the best that it can be. And I think putting that spin on it is much better than saying, you know, I don't know, \"we've got all these fancy things, now come into the office.\" I think the coming into the office is the \"I want to come into the office because I want to see people and socialise and do other things with people.\" Not because \"I'm going to go in for the coffee.\" But saying that, I would go in if there was a Starbucks machine, just for that.\nDDS: It makes me sad, just before we come to Jon, so it makes me sad the organisations would only be doing this because of that. So, so many people don't have a choice over where they work, right? So, there's this quote, you know, it's linked in many ways to the conversation around knowledge work and where people do it, so many people don't have a choice. I would like to think people would want to create a great environment regardless. And in fact, particularly for people who don't have a choice around where they're going to work, it feels the wrong way round to me. But Jon.\nJD: I actually love going into the office. And it's not necessarily just about the design for me, it's the environment that you create, the ways of working and the culture, more importantly around your organisation, rather than just having nice Starbucks machines and nice chairs. And I think, the reason why I love going into the office is exactly to your point, is to actually interact with people and to have conversations that you can't do remotely because they're very, very transactional and actually talk about ideas and suggestions. And I was, you know, when this sort of topic came up, I was talking to someone and I said \"yeah, have you ever heard of peacocking?\". I'll go and Google it and it was it was an interesting. So, this is what it means and, you know, I've never heard of that and they said \"it's a really interesting subject actually, because what we've got really, really well here is we've just had like a new financial analyst that started, someone who works in digital\". And they said, \"I actually heard them saying it's really good that we're able to come into the office because I've worked in organisations before that give you a choice of home working or not. But actually, here I really want to come in, because the reasons why I come in is because I'm learning so much from some of the conversations I'm part of because it's an open plan area and just I feel a lot more part of the organisation.\" But for me, it's all about the culture piece. How you create that culture rather than actually the design space, that's just one small element.\nJEP: And I absolutely agree with that, but that's got nothing to do necessarily with what kind of chair you're sitting on. Is it, necessarily? I mean, if you're having to, if you're getting back pain from it, that might be an issue, but you're absolutely right. I mean, we work in a hybrid fashion. People come in, when they come in, they want to come in, they want to see everybody else. So they tend to congregate on a few days when they know they're going to see a lot of people and they want to work with them and they want to see them and they want to do all those things face-to-face, which are so natural and easy to do, which you, which are much harder to do when you work remotely.\nJC: David, we have a lot of people who have no choice. They have to come in, yeah? So, we make their spaces great, yeah? We provide stuff for them so that they can come in, so when they do come in, it's nice. But actually, what we've discovered of recent times, because we have done, I was laughing when I read about it because we have done exactly that. We have upgraded a number of our offices, but it's because our people are going in there and they were, saying, \"actually the facilities are not as great as they could be\" and you recognise they're not. So, I do think it leads to the \"am I valued?\" and it's one of the ways I think companies and organisations show that there is some like, \"yes, you are valued because we're creating a nice space.\"\nDDS: So, I'm going to have to bring it to a close here.\nJC: No!\nDDS: Because I have to, it's the way it works. Otherwise, I'll be here in fortnight. But I think we can all agree that there are many ways to support people. You can support their career development, you can support their aspirations, you can support their well-being. Supporting a really nice environment is one of those, but it's not the only thing that's available. So, that's all from us today. I'd like to thank our guests: Jon, Jo, Jane-Emma. Really thank you for your time today, it's so appreciated, and your openness. We've got a wealth of resources available to our members, supporting you with a number of the issues that we've discussed today. And as I say, over the coming months, we're going to move to a more thematic view at the CIPD.  The first month will be around conflict, so lots of things that we spoke about earlier. You'll see our resources surfaced on that. We publish new episodes of the People Pod every fortnight. You obviously know where to find it or you wouldn't be able to listen to my voice saying this but do make sure that you subscribe and get it on your regular rotation. And keep talking about the issues that we covered today in the CIPD Community Platform as well. My name's David D'Souza and this has been the HR People Pod. Thank you very much.\nTune in to the latest episode of the HR People Pod, where our panel assesses the impact of the so-called 'Great Retention' and considers whether a period of stability is beneficial for organisations. We discuss how business leaders may be facing an uphill battle as employees become more sceptical of organisational direction, and also if the idea of 'Office Peacocking' ruffles any feathers?\n \nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Jon Dawson, chief people officer at Lore Group; Jo Carlin, senior VP HR Europe and global head of inclusion and diversity at Firstsource; and Jane-Emma Peerless, director of people at Caxton. \n \nRecorded: 30 August 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 6: Conflict | AI and CVs | Gender imbalance in HR | 'Quiet vacationing'\nDuration: 00:30:02\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting the people profession and the world of work. This is episode six and we've already had guests from a range of organisations, large and small, bringing you their expert insights. I'm David D'Souza, Director of Profession at the CIPD, and joining me in the studio today we have...\nCaroline Roberts: Caroline Roberts.\nDDS: And what's your background, Caroline?\nCR: Well, I started my career making radio programmes at the BBC before moving into HR. I've worked in various sectors from architecture to television to membership bodies and I also work as an Associate Non-Executive Director in the NHS.\nDDS: I feel a lot of pressure if you've previously done radio in the BBC this feels like, or maybe actually you're an asset today, maybe I should see it as a strength rather than a threat.\nCR: I didn't tell you that I was any good at it though, did I?\nDDS: That's true. That's true and very honest. We also have Claire McCartney.\nClaire McCartney: Hello, so I'm Policy and Practice Manager here at CIPD with a focus on resourcing inclusion, talent management and formerly worked at Roffey Park.\nDDS: Fantastic, so barrels of expertise personally, but also you pull together all of the work that we do that we put out giving people expert guidance and influencing on policy as well. So, delighted to have you here, Claire. So, really glad that you both joined the show, but before we get started, I always ask our guests what have you been watching or reading recently that might be interesting or give an insight into your soul? So, Caroline if we start with you.\nCR: I think what I've been reading is quite worrying for an insight into my soul because it's, I've been reading a book about life in medieval London, a history of surgery, but I am currently reading Atomic Habits, which I think everyone else has read, but I've got a few bad habits that I need to sort out.\nDDS: Is it helping because it's quite popular at the moment isn't that part of the zeitgeist?\nCR: I think what's really helpful about it is, it talks about systems with things, so you create systems in order to create habits. So, rather than focusing on the future all the time it's what you do every day. So, it's much more manageable but I'm yet to crack the habit of stopping eating while standing up in the kitchen and sticking my head in the fridge.\nDDS: That's quite a niche one isn't it as well, but if you do come back actually in a future point and let us know about that one. And Claire, what about you?\nCM: I've been reading a book called Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan, which is really actually beautifully written, quite a challenging you know subject about the way that women were treated with regards to having to give up children and the way that the children were treated, so, it's quite a challenging read but it's beautifully written, and I've been watching One Day and managed to make it to the end of the day and couldn't stop crying at the end of that.\nDDS: What is One Day? I have no idea, what have I missed?\nCM: Yeah, so One Day is about two people who meet when they're really young; they never quite get together but actually at some point, they make that connection. I can't give away too much. I've read the book a long time ago and actually, I blanked out the ending because it was yeah, a bit challenging so.\nDDS: I've been reading a book by Alex Edmund and it's on evidence-based within organisations, and at the same time, I've got another one going on which is about the history of conspiracies, which I think is really interesting. So, it's how ideas that are not true spread, and what are the social dynamics that lead to that, and what are the kind of traits that you can see within some of those dynamics, which is really interesting for our times. Now, just a reminder for anyone listening, we talk generally about subjects so we will have a topic as a jumping-off point, but if we talk about an individual company as a jumping-off point, that doesn't mean that we're commenting on the individual company following that. And you all know as experienced professionals that what's going on behind the scenes isn't necessarily what gets talked about in the headlines.\nSo, we're kicking off today with a difficult subject, but one that I think it would be remiss of us not to cover. So, over the last fortnight, towns and cities across the UK have seen violent protests, vandalism, looting, rioting, and racist acts. Whilst the rioting has subsided, that doesn't mean that that's the end of the issue or the end of the impact for people, and indeed there are still different acts of vandalism and violence happening on a smaller scale now. That's against a background of a really traumatic last few years in terms of significant conflict across the world, and that can play out in organisations, but we also know it impacts individuals working for organisation whether it be their friends or families or direct impacts or fears for them. So, the priority for any organisation should be of course to support employees through that, but equally you've got different views on what's happening in different points of conflict. I wanted to get a view from you both actually as to what you think the challenges are within organisations and what they should be doing at this point. Over the next month actually as we go into September, the CIPD will be placing a particular focus on conflict management within organisations that's part of a broader piece of work we're doing to make it easier for you to find what you need from us in a thematic way. And unfortunately, conflict management seems a sensible place for us to start. and what they should be doing at this point. So, if I start with you Caroline, it's been a really difficult few weeks but, as I say, it's not over yet. So, what it impacts in organisations, what do organisations need to be doing?\nCR: Well, I think it's really important for organisations to be clear and reiterate what the expected behaviours and values are for the organisation and be clear about that. And also, for leadership to visibly model those behaviours and values. I think that there's a lot of anger and fear generally in society, and that's not new, but also to remember there is more that unites us than divides us. Organisations, their policies are still in force so behaviour that is unacceptable, the policies around that are still there. If there's the belief that someone has committed a criminal act and there's excellent guidance on the CIPD website around that, there are still policies and procedures to follow around that. There's been an awful lot of anger I think in workforces generally post-pandemic, cost of living, the jobs market, not feeling heard, fear about people's safety, policing, you know it's much wider societal issues and still having a safe space to discuss, these contentious issues because they are deeper than the very polarised ones that we've seen and heard in the news and talking about those and still having that trust. I think in terms of HR leadership one thing to be aware of is virtue signalling because it's easy for you to become distant from your colleagues and workforce. People spot it a mile off. So, don't make further knowledge or incite anything further by feeling that you need to come out particularly strongly on your own behalf around things. Think of your workforce, think about their points of views and just look into things a little bit deeper and taking that measured approach. We don't always have to react, but responding is often a more helpful way forward.\nDDS: So, just to kind of dial into that last bit because I think it's a really interesting one. There's quite often a criticism about the gap between the rhetoric in some of these spaces and actually what's helpful, and I guess it's one of those times, isn't it? It's quite easy for people to make big bold statements, but actually what's the substance that's sitting behind that, which is the challenge. Claire, have you got any thoughts to add to that?\nCM: Yeah, I think we absolutely need to acknowledge what's going on in broader society and I think you know, that there's been a great deal of kind of polarising through different channels like social media, and you know we can't brush that under the carpet. Many people have felt you know very unsafe. There's been you know a great deal of racism that needs to be challenged head on, really. So, I think we do need to create those opportunities within our organisations to acknowledge that, to create safe places for people to discuss, but also to ensure that there is you know some quite strong facilitation there as well. You know, to make sure that we're not tipping into really contentious areas as well. So, you know I certainly think it isn't something that we can brush under the carpet. We need to engage and talk to our workforces around these things and make sure that people are feeling safe.\nDDS: Yeah, and I think that point around race is probably the key one because if you live in an area impacted by the riots you will be concerned about that as a point in time and have other concerns lingering. But actually, if you feel that you've been specifically targeted because of your race or your religion that's a statement around how welcome you feel in society day to day and I think that's the, that's the bit that is enduring and comes on the back of not just Black Lives Matters but long-term systemic problems and I've spoken to people scared to leave their house, spoken to people scared for friends and family and that's a massive psychological and real impact on those people. Is there something around practitioners as well? Because I think it's hugely challenging to deal with people who are in that state of fear, it's hugely challenging particularly if you work in an organization where perhaps someone has been implicated in being involved in this and the tensions that that caused. Huge time of strain for the profession again. Caroline, have you got any advice for kind of that separation of the day-to-day, there is something, how do you stay calm in a circumstance like that? How do you not take too much of it home with you?\nCR: I think there's something just about the sort of common humanity, checking in with people, when these things started happening, I just checked in with friends saying, you OK? You know not over-egging things which for such you know, some of the really heinous acts as well, you know, that might seem I'm playing it down and I'm not, but it's keeping that perspective, that you know the vast majority of people are welcoming to people as well. Keeping you know, keeping that very much as a focus, but doing those little regular check-ins and having it in your organization as part of the way that we do business, But I do think that the modelling behaviours is so important, you can say whatever you like, but people will look up and they will see you know how are you behaving with these things.\nDDS: Excellent, thank you, and as Caroline has pointed out actually helpfully, so I didn't have to. We do have resources on the CIPD website, so do make your way there if you're still reconciling or struggling with these problems internally, and indeed, if anything further comes up. We're going to move on something a little bit light-hearted now or not light-hearted, but it's certainly a change of pace. So, job hunters are reportedly flooding recruiters with AI-generated CVs, according to one headline, with some estimates suggesting about half of all job seekers using our tools to apply for roles. Clogging up recruitment mechanics and putting low quality applications into quite a difficult labour market already. I've been speaking to some recruiters specifically around this and it's a real challenge for them. So, I think there's some substance behind that headline. But candidates are increasingly turning clearly to generative AI to assist them writing CVs, cover letters, and there's a degree of contention over whether this finally is the end of the cover letter and potentially also completing assessments and interviews. I've heard about as well so, live transcriptions from whoever's interviewing you being turned into advice as to what you should say. So, the CIPD community forum has been having a chat about this and there's I think a degree of contention between acknowledging that, you should be able to use tools to enhance and assist you in your applications, versus it should be you that's getting assessed rather than technology. So, question for you both, I suppose is what next? Is part of it, so what do we think the general direction of this is? And secondly, should candidates be using this technology or what are the limitations? We wouldn't criticise the candidate now for using a spell check, but this feels like that's it's certainly a level beyond that. Claire, if I start with you, because I know it's a particular area of expertise for you.\nCM: Of course. I mean, I think it would be naive of us to say that, you know, we that candidates shouldn't be using AI tools. I mean, employers are using them as part of their recruitment processes, hopefully in responsible ways. So, I think it's about, you know, really thinking quite carefully about how they might be using them so, it might be perhaps to kickstart to structure to polish but actually, candidates really need to be aware of you know some of the weaknesses that actually if they're using AI considerably then they're going to get very generic responses, they're going to be impersonal; they're potentially going to be quite poorly evidenced as well. So, it's about you know, really thinking quite carefully about that perhaps using AI tools sparingly as I said to get started. Then making sure that they're feeding in personalised context, that the context should definitely be you know be their own work and tailored to your own personalised skills, interests and motivations because actually that that is the thing that's going to resonate most in terms of, you know, getting through to selection as well. I'd probably challenge, we've done a lot of work around inclusive recruitment and with the behavioral insights team and I would challenge necessarily the use of CVs you know, application forms and seem to be more inclusive and then there are ways when we get into interviews which are also kind of better predictors of on-the-job performance like, certainly structured interviews over non-structured interviews but also work-based assessments as well, which can help tackle some of the challenges that you've been talking about, David.\nDDS: So, a couple of things I just wanted to pick up on one is: and we've obviously got some resources as you say on how to create a fair process; but secondly, within that, I just want to pick up on that notion of cover letters because you mentioned structured versus non-structured and application versus CV. Thoughts on cover letters?\nCM: I think our general advice, you know, from an inclusive recruitment perspective is not to use covering letters and CVs but to use short application forms as part of the process and they would be, you know, they'd be a better kind of indicator and more inclusive as well for a broader range of candidates, so that's generally our advice based on the evidence that's come through from that guidance.\nDDS: Thank you. It's interesting isn't it over time I've seen, I've never lied on my CV actually I can say that honestly, what I have seen is other people's CVs with stuff that I've done on it which is always an interesting one they pass your desk. Caroline, we're going to talk actually a little bit in the next section about exec recruitment because we were having a chat about that earlier and I think we can thread that in nicely, but what are your views on this increasing automation on both sides of that process?\nCR: Well, first of all, I just couldn't agree more with what Claire has said you know, absolutely, things like work-based assessments, there's, you're going to get a much much better result at the at the end of things. And around motivation it's quite funny sometimes to to put in some wild questions into things like, you know, ChatGPT, things like that. And if you put in, what is my motivation for X, into it, it comes out as so hollow and generic, you know, it will be seen through straight away. I think what we really need to think about is how are we going to improve the hiring process? So, thinking about things like work-based assessments and the application forms. And at the moment, very often the recruitment process can be demoralizingly unpleasant from both sides. Last night, I was having a cursory glance at Reddit to do a little bit of research into recruitment and how people feel about it and what phrases were they using for the recruitment process? People were saying painful, hellish, constant anxiety and ghosting and this is something that we can actually change. And through changing it, you get the best person for the role, much, much more inclusive, versatile workforce. And it's just more pleasant for everybody concerned with it.\nDDS: And Reddit is, as you say, a very valid place to do that research. I guess my general concern is it feels like a race to the bottom on both sides of this equation. So, you've got organisations using more technology and putting people through processes at times. And this is the worst of it. I don't think every organisation is doing this, that are less and less human and more and more distant or with multiple stages where people don't feel valued. And on the other side, you've got people turning to technology to almost combat that. If every candidate starts applying for every job using technology, the possibility of getting that rich feedback naturally declines because organisations are being overwhelmed. And I read about, read a few this week with organisations getting you know, 1,000, 2,000 applications for one job. Makes it very difficult, particularly if 50% of those aren't genuine. So, I wanted to move on to, occasionally, I do some research for this show. This week, I was doing some background research, and I started reading a really interesting article on BBC Worklife looking at the US exec jobs market and the gap between the diversity statements that organisations are putting out and the reality of the experience for women candidates and the mix in the workplace there. And then I was delighted to see when I checked the authors, it was actually someone I know. It's a fantastic journalist called Josie Cox, wrote a book called Women, Money, Power about the relationship between those few things that's worth checking out whilst we're doing book recommendations. But I wanted to talk specifically about the HR profession, our profession more broadly and the shape of that. So, in many industries women are disproportionately represented at the senior levels, as in there are fewer women than you would expect from the general population. But in the people profession, we've got some different statistics which is that women represent over half of senior roles so about 61% but 9 in 10 of roles at a more junior level, so, entry level positions 9 out of 10 declines to 6 out of 10. And I wanted to have a conversation, I guess from two aspects. One is that a problem in terms of not having more male representation in the profession as a whole, so is there a reason for that? But secondly Caroline you and I were chatting earlier just about the reality of the job market, particularly at that senior end earlier and I wanted to start with you before I come to Claire for some kind of comments around the gender mix within the profession just around what's it like at the moment if you're looking for a role, what are some of the challenges? And you mentioned a few things in terms of the changing shape of roles as well that I thought would be really good to share.\nCR: Well, I think in terms of HR being at the top table being C-suite, I have seen a decline in the number of those roles where businesses are making savings and so, they'll take off the people director role and perhaps the HR manager role and combine it into a head of HR. So, that's one thing that I've you know that I've really Noticed, I think that it is extremely tight job market and when people are trying to redeploy internally there's a trend in some organizations that they'll move someone else from a different area who may not have a background in HR or qualifications. But that you know, I've come across with some leaders there's an assumption because it's got people in the title that anyone can do it because we're all people, aren't we. So, that's one thing, it can sometimes be seen as a softer option. I think the other thing that I wanted to bring in here is around the point at which people are applying for a job. And they're not applying for particular roles, you know. They're going to be coming to a certain age perhaps when they feel ready to go for a particularly senior role, and for women that may coincide with a point where they may have taken a career break to raise children or they may be going through the perimenopause as well, which is a point where for some women they may experience a loss, a loss of confidence at the same time they're ready to apply for those roles. So, if we're seeing you know fewer roles or fewer suitable roles, more demand for less flexible roles that might be quite a difficult thing. So, I think, I think, Professor Chung at Kent University was talking about the work placement requirements, particularly for women of colour, hampering progression and a bit of a backlash against DEI, you know, people seeing that its feminism gone too far. So, I think that places, you know, that places an added pressure onto something. But it does, you know, it does concern me that you have 91% of HR admin roles being occupied by females and then suddenly go to the more senior levels and it's and it's down by 30%. So, I think that's, I think that's something that is concerning.\nDDS: Is that the concern or should it be that we don't have enough men at junior levels coming into the profession, and that we then don't have balanced representation at the top end. It feels to me, and I'm just, it's a really interesting one in this space, isn't it? That there are two views we could take, either that actually it's important that there are some professions where the disparity is actually different to what we see in the main economy, and I think there's a compelling argument there. But the other argument is that for a profession that's focused on equality, inclusion, and diversity, we should probably be finding a way to invite more men into it and sorting that balance over time. Have you got a view on that because I've heard both and I've heard both get, I've heard people be shouted down on both sides actually physically done.\nCR: Well, I think that in terms of you know, in terms of percentages, those are going to fluctuate and that, and I think that that's fine. I think when it's 91% of HR admin being female, that's the thing that we should be looking, we should be looking at, you know, why are there so many, and what happens to them. So, I think getting some more data around that, some more insight in order to address what the fundamental problems which will be intersectional ones to find out what they are and then we can address some of those.\nDDS: Claire, what your thoughts?\nCM: I think it's kind of a combination of the two, I think we do need to get more men into the profession, and you know, I think we need to be doing more work in that space, you know, sharing male HR professional role models at all different levels. But also, perhaps more, you know, focused career advice and outreach work as part of schools and colleges. I think that will help to bring in more men to the profession. I completely agree with Caroline around addressing some of those challenges for female progression within the profession and, you know, it's not just within our profession, it's obviously across lots of other profession sectors. But, you know, we need to be addressing those issues and there are, you know, there are still kind of gender bias at play but there are also other challenges with you know, women still predominantly taking on caring responsibilities and the need for greater flexible working but also, I think, you know, greater transparency as well in terms of, promotion decisions as well could be really helpful. So, there are a whole kind of range of things that we can think about but we I think we need to think about both of those aspects actually.\nDDS: Yeah, and at the CIPD it's probably worth saying we're going to be doing a couple of things that people will see from us one is more work on the shape of the profession and what's changing in it. So, to your point around the changing job roles and the changing demographics that sit within it and secondly there's a really interesting thing that just picked up on there which was your point that because it's people CEOs think that anyone can do it. And we need to make the case as a professional body for the fact that it's important work, it's expert work, and it requires experts, and it requires investment in their skills and recognition of their capabilities, and that's our job as a professional body. And I think, we'll spend more and more time and effort on that because I think it's absolutely critical for the profession that, the role continues to be recognised and in fact the recognition of it grows. And I think during the pandemic there was a spur of interest in it. We need to make sure that that's not lost. It's a bit of a running theme on this podcast to explore the meaning of the latest trend or buzzword that's impacting the profession. Claire will know that we get lots of media inquiries, each week going, what do you think about this? And my response is normally a bit of an eye roll, and we'll do the interview anyway and try and get them to talk about something grown-up. So, I'm thinking about calling this section, is it really a thing? Because I think that's kind of the level, we're reaching with some of this. Just a reminder to all of our viewers, whether you're a student, whether you're experiencing a change in your career, just because something happens on TikTok doesn't make it real. Or it means it might be a tiny thing, it might have happened once but doesn't mean it's happened all the time. So, in our last episode, we talked a little bit about the implications of a workation, so, that's continuing to work for but from a different location. This week is the turn of what might be considered its evil twin, which is quiet vacationing, which is looking like you're working but really taking a holiday. Claire, I'm going to come to you first, what are your thoughts on quiet vacationing? Is it a thing? What should organizations be thinking about?\nCM: I mean, I think I'd challenge that it is a thing, I mean I'm not a fan of the buzzwords and you know sometimes they just come up, come from absolutely no, I suppose what we need to get at is the underlying, you know, situation within organizations, you know. Do people feel motivated? You know, have supportive line managers? Are they engaged with the work that they're doing, and I think those are the aspects that we need to be really focusing on rather than, you know, suspecting people are off on a quiet vacation, you know, so I suppose that would be my perspective. I'm a little bit cynical about it.\nCR: I'm with Claire on this one, also known as unauthorized absence, which sounds rather less, rather less glamorous. If an employee was doing this, it's unlikely to be out of the blue, they're going to meet some performance issues, breakdown of trust and confidence, you know manager's trust is key and also having some performance management with outcomes as well. So, looking at the way that people do work best but is it really a thing, not really.\nDDS: So, it's quite interesting, the media inquiry we got combined it with Gen Z so, this is a Gen Z thing that only they're doing it's like well, look, people have been slacking for years, people have been lying to their managers for years, that's a, it's maybe a slightly different form of that didn't exist before and one of the things I said to the interview when they went, how often does this happen, I was like well, if they're doing it successfully we're never going to know. (Inaudible) that, that's an unreasonable thing, it's like saying how many really effective ninjas are in this room at the moment. I don't know so, that's all from us today. I'd really like to thank our guests today, Caroline and Claire for showing your thoughts on the breadth of topics and as ever to everyone listening.

We exist as a professional body to support the profession, absolutely, please do make the most of that. I'm David D'Souza and this has been the HR People Pod. See you next time. Thank you.\nIn the latest episode of the HR People Pod, our panel reflects on the recent riots in the UK, the conflicts happening globally and the effects they have in the workplace. We also get to grips with the rising use of generative AI by job applicants, the gender mix within the profession, and the concept of 'quiet vacationing' - another media catchphrase or a real phenomenon?\nCIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Caroline Roberts, associate non-executive director at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University NHS Trust, and Claire McCartney, policy and practice manager - resourcing, inclusion and talent management, CIPD.\nRecorded: 16 August 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 5: Pay transparency | 'Workation' | Bullying and incivility | Social mobility\nDuration: 00:30:10\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and welcome to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast bringing you the topical stories and expert insights on issues impacting the people profession and the world of work. My name is David D'Souza, I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD, and joining me in the studio today as we celebrate South Asian Heritage Month is...\nJanet Campbell: Janet Campbell, I'm the HR Director for R&R Delivery Authority. Hi.\nGarin Rauch: Hi, my name is Garin Rauch, I'm an Organisation Development Consultant for Distinction Business Consulting and also heavily involved in the CIPD.\nWoosh Raza: My name is Woosh Raza, pronouns are he, him and I'm the Director of People at NCBO which is the membership body for charities in England.\nDDS: Excellent, Janet you've actually got a really fascinating job, you said you used an acronym, what's your job?\nJC: I do. So, yes, honestly acronyms, yuck, hate them. So, the R&R is the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority, and my organisation is responsible for developing and then delivering the scheme to restore and renew the Houses of Parliament.\nDDS: This is an amazing thing, isn't it?\nJC: It is amazing.\nDDS: Yeah, that's like once every few hundred years.\nJC: Absolutely, once in a lifetime thing.\nDDS: Once in a lifetime.\nJC: Once in a lifetime for sure.\nDDS: Excellent, wonderful to have you all join the show. Just before we get started, just to make you all seem a little bit more human because you can be very scary, particularly a couple of you, can you tell us a little bit more about yourself? So, what have you been watching, reading, consuming recently? So, what's kind of getting you excited?\nJC: So, at the minute I am absolutely fascinated by the Olympics. I found myself watching archery and then pausing it and rewinding it so I could work out the scoring mechanism and then was fascinated when the magnifying glass was the thing that determined who won the women's, whether it was South Korea or China. South Korea did it, 10 years, massive, wonderful, I've been amazed by the whole Olympics thing.\nDDS: It is amazing. Do you remember Craig David, the singer?\nJC: Yes.\nDDS: Do you know he's on the Olympic team?\nJC: No, never.\nDDS: Yeah, like the archery team, he's the bow selector. Sorry, sorry, sorry.\nGR: Oh my God.\nDDS: It's niche, isn't it? Garin, what have you been watching?\nGR: Well, I've got my own Olympics of a different description. It's the childcare Olympics for the summer holidays. So, it's literally balancing two children in different clubs and that as well. So, it doesn't give much free time, but I guess I'm a bit of a geek. I do like to; you have to constantly read about organisation, development. So, I'm trying to currently master John Seddon and his system thinking. So, it's a little bit techie, but it's really enjoyable reading.\nDDS: It is, and that's a difficult one to juggle, I think. Have you got any idea how you think you'll medal or rank in the childcare Olympics?\nGR: Currently I'm a DNF.\nDDS: OK. I'm still coming.\nWR: And finally, Woosh. OK, so I'm going to bring the tone right down. I've just finished watching Love Island. Love Island finished on Monday. I'm so sorry. I'm such a big...\nDDS: We're moving on. We're keeping it a level above that, at least. I've been, I'm watching, it's rare that I watch a TV programme more than once, but I'm watching the first two series of The Bear for the third time.\nJC: I love Bear.\nDDS: And it is, to your point, Garin, look, I love stuff around work. It's what we do day in, day out. I find it of interest. And that show is so powerful, showing the intensity of a kitchen. But also, I don't think I've ever watched a programme where I care about the characters. Everyone so much. And there's something for me about, I guess, the locus or the limits of our care in a work environment. So, if I'm watching a show and I can care about every background character and what happens to them in their narrative, how does that translate to a workplace? But also, I've never found a show so stressful and draining to watch. And from that point of view, there's an emotional toll that comes with caring for everyone around you. But just as a reminder, for everything that we're talking about today, it's the general principles of what's happening. So, we might mention a report, we might mention an organisation, but we want to have a broader chat with experienced professionals about what it's like going on behind the scenes and the reality of it. So, it won't be context-agnostic. We'll talk about a topic, but we won't be talking about the organisations involved. So, let's crack on. The first story that I'd like to talk about this kind of podcast is about paid transparency. It's been a long-term kind of point of debate in the profession. So, the headline stems from research carried out by Adzuna. Other providers are available, who report that less than half of job adverts featured salary information in June 20,24, the lowest figure they've got since 2016. The CIPD's own pay performance and transparency report this year further supported that finding. It said that just 41% of employers always share pay ranges in external job adverts. Less than one in five, fewer than one in five, less than one in five, fewer than one in five, always share specific salaries in internal job adverts, so you've got something really interesting there which is what you tell people internally, what you tell people externally? Do you do that consistently?\nJC: I was really surprised to read that; really, really surprised! I'm like, gosh, haven't we moved forward?\nGR: But we haven't.\nJC: And we have another, and I'm a real fan of transparency in pay. Not least because if you are really transparent about what you're paying when you're going out into the market, you are less likely to bring into your organization historic pay gaps. So, I don't understand it; I don't understand why.\nWR: Do you know what I saw? I'll use an example about a year four or five years ago, I applied for a job. So, I want to take it one step further. I'm not even a fan of pay bands from this to this because the job that I applied for was like this is the salary range from this to this, right? And I looked at it at the top end of the salary range, made sense for where I was and what I wanted, and why I wanted to move and kind of earning potential. I went through the whole process, and it was extensive as an exec appointment, and at the end of it, they were like, oh, actually we're going to give it to you at the beginning of that pay band. So, I was like, well, why have you, why have you published, why have you published that that job within those saying that you're paying from this to this? And they're like, well, we won't be able to do anything other than this. Well, then say that on your job application, you would have wasted my time and actually your time. I went through the whole process. And the other thing I just want to add to that point around pay transparency. All right, it's really sad that we're still in the situation and I was shocked by those kinds of figures, is how we're going to close all these gaps if there's ethnicity pay gaps and meant gender pay gaps and disability pay gaps? If we're not being clear on what we're going to be paying people for doing the job, like I still don't understand why we aren't more transparent when it comes to our pay.\nDDS: Yeah. Well, I think there's in theory who would disagree with it because you know, it does all these wonderful things, it promotes equity, it simplifies recruitment, it's fair on the candidate, all that kind of stuff. But I guess there's obviously two sides to the coin here isn't it? There's the market in terms of attracting the right candidate, but it's something that it does internally to an organization as well. And often it can reveal sort of decisions that have been made over the years, and it can cause some internal disruption because, can, you know, internal people start looking at their salaries and go, hang on, what's going on here? as well. So, I think it depends on whether the employer's taking a long-term or a short-term view if they're looking for a short-term, let's try and just get through this thing without ruffling too many feathers, then they'll go, the path of least resistance but if they're really serious about equity if they're really serious about transparency, then they'll lean into it and provide a space to deal with all the internal fallout as well.\nJC: And on that internal part, I think the internal point is really interesting and I think it's about, what's the narrative you create in your organization and do you give space to have that conversation internally, right? So, at what point do you have a conversation because somebody the head of rewards, the HR, whoever it is has a view, right? They know what what the what the span of pay is across the organization they can work out if their organization is, if you do regular pay audits and all of that, you know. You know if you're looking at your equal pay gaps, your gender pay gaps, your ethnicity pay gaps. If you do that on a regular basis, just as a hygiene function for your organization, you know what what's going on and you know the sorts of things you need to do to resolve it. Deal with it, there's no because you stick it under, chuck it in the corner, it'll come back to bite you eventually. Sorry, I'm gabbling because I feel so strong about this.\nWR: No.\nJC: If you don't deal with it, all you do is you create problems\nWR: Absolutely.\nJC: That just get worse and worse and worse and worse.\nWR: What are you saying to your internal people when you bring Someone in on like 5, 10, 15 grand more and that person gets pissed off because they're like well I'm not earning that much for this similarly the same job.\nJC: Exactly.\nWR: And your answer to that is to hide the fact that you're giving that that salary to someone. What does that say about how you are seeing the talent within your organization? I just think that's a really awful narrative in 2024.\nJC: Indeed. And I do wonder whether there is actually a generational thing as well, whether you know did we come up in an era where you were less likely to talk about what you paid, you kept that a bit more private but younger workers are much more open and transparent about what they get paid.\nWR: Yeah, absolutely.\nJC: And therefore, you're more those conversations are more likely to come up.\nWR: Yeah.\nJC: Right? Across a coffee or whatever.\nGR: Yeah, and I think there's also it's important that there's different flavours of transparency. So, there's like your your actual salary but then there's total reward and I think if you do go down a path of actually having transparency, if you actually see like the full package that people get as a reward, particularly the more senior get, that's, it's not an equal thing. So, I think that's something that to really sort of take into consideration. We work with a client that they did the fatal left the salaries on the printer. And we had to go in afterwards, which is possibly the worst way.\nDDS: Can I just say for any students listening, and there will be some, certainly, look for a, for a period, and it still happens occasionally here; it was like a rite of passage, a really painful rite of passage, I think, for any HR team, because the chances of sending out everyone's salary by spreadsheet but sending it to the wrong people, all those kind of things. That there was a point earlier in my career where I felt like once a year, I was just consoling people who had made that egregious error of sharing everything with everyone. And you're right there's a there's a kind of transparency bit there but the amount of organizations over time that did accidental transparency, I think was an impressive list.\nGR: But it just presents an amazing opportunity. So, this organization it was it was a terrible fallout, and I think probably the reluctance that stops organizations actually pressing the button, going right, is that initial discomfort because it brings it all to the surface. All the unfairness, all the different decisions that were made in different contexts, it all comes out. And so, it's the fear of dealing with those moments that's, because this organization, we did an OD intervention. We did dialogical spaces, all sounds very fancy, doesn't it? But basically, it was an opportunity for people not to shout each other but work through it, and they afterwards were liberated because it was all out on the table, and they could then focus so much more organizational energy to what really mattered, which is the task rather than the corridor conversations and gossip.\nJC: And actually, I think in that way, I don't, I'm not saying that there has to be this equity all the way through, because that's not realistic, right? So, we just need to be real about it all. I just think that hiding what you're paying, what people I'm not and neither I'm saying, let's print out, oh everyone's paid and let's share that in that way. If when you're hiring, be clear about what the salary is and if you have a range, it shouldn't be PS25,000 to PS100,000 because that's unrealistic to your earlier point, that's ridiculous. But if you're thinking, do you know what? Is there a have I got a 10% margin? Right, so advertise that at the midpoint, so you've got a 10% margin. Do you know what I mean? What somebody was paid in their previous role has got nothing to do with what I'm prepared to pay them for the job that I've got.\nDDS: Brilliant. Thank you, I'm going to move us on because we've now established that there's a range in this room between, Dialogico D and Love Island, which is quite pronounced. So, look, I hate the next topic viscerally, I think you know it will be of interest to people listening, but I hate it because I think it pulls up a few arguments which I'm really frustrated with. But depending on where you are in the world right, you may or may not be taking holiday at this point, but in the UK, it's been horrible weather and it's now getting slightly nicer, but we're also into school holidays which means people are attempting to as an Olympic sport in terms of childcare, but over the last few years there's been a blurring of the lines between work and home. Some of that's technology-enabled, some of that was you know caused by some of the changes and shifts that organizations saw in some spaces in some sectors for some roles which is I guess part of my gripe during the pandemic. And there's this term, workation, which is where people change their environment but continue working.\nGR: My toes are curling as you're saying that.\nDDS: With a view to sparing their creativity and productivity so I'm going to swap out my environment, I'm maybe going to work from the beach. I was actually at a campsite with my family last week. You could see people with the laptops out there. There's a growing desire among workers which I can understand and again I would say some workers, some sectors, some roles to adopt that type of flexible working. Look, there's a range of stuff right, on site vs knowledge work, flexibility like general thoughts on this but toe-curling appears to be the first thought that's coming through.\nGR: Yeah, well OD people always say I'm only allowed one for this conversation, it's an, it depends answer. So, it there's so many factors that depend on this as well. So, I guess the the initial thought was it kind of makes sense, but then when you look at it deeper, every organizational context is different. So, if you like to think of Janet's organization, the House of Commons, there's a real blend of operational staff and knowledge workers. So, you know, you can have people that can easily go into something like workations, but there's a whole plethora of stuff that can't have that, and that creates a sense of equity and fairness as well. So, and then there's just so many mitigating factors here, isn't it? Can you actually get out there and get a good reception and it's not necessarily something around the me, it's about what's right for the team as well. So, you know I think with anything it's a lot of organizations haven't got hybrid right before even embarking on workation. So, you know how do you make sure that those boundaries are kind of in place before people can actually get it right?\nWR: Oh my god, so I literally saved myself for this because I'm such, it's such an awful like fad, like that's gone. And actually, there's so much in this and that depends piece that Garin's just said, I think yeah 100% like look at what's right for your organization but like effectively aren't we saying like, aren't we saying that like, the right to switch off isn't that part of like something that's coming in the new deal. You know, because this is a request that we're making, and I think the word boundaries is so important right now for employers. Like put boundaries in, if you're off, you're off, like let's be clear on like what we mean by this because it drives all sorts of inequities, employee relations issues, disciplinary is on the basis of like you know, you asked me to do this, this that and the other because we're being ambiguous in the ask of people who are working within our organizations and banking on discretionary effort to advance those efforts. Whereas actually that should not be the case, we should be clear that we are allowing anyone, regardless of whether you're in a physical building or a knowledge worker, to have that set time off. And that is my issue, I think we need to build boundaries back into the workplace, and the term workation is a joke. Sorry, it's an actual joke. Like, if you're working from home and you're working on the beach, or you know, campsite, or Portugal actually, because I've realized that Portugal doesn't have a time difference by the way. And I'm seriously considering the implications that for me, but like if you're working and that's cool, but if you're taking leave then that is your time to take. And we need to as we need to lead the way and role model. What does that mean for everyone?\nJC: There is an unhelpful blurring of the lines, right. Working from, working away from the office, let's call it that. And if I'm working away from the office in Portugal because I'm working, that's fine. But being on annual leave on holiday, on vacation and then saying, oh, I'm having a workation, doesn't make any sense to me.\nDDS: So, I'm going to move us on because I think there's broad consensus, but I think, I think there's something here which I think is really interesting, which is some of these and we talked about it on the last podcast, so do go back and listen to that. There's something around the fact that people are naming things in probably quite a lazy way or for attention, that's getting in the way of some really nuanced debates, I think around the questions around balance of work time and work. The flexibility of environment that may, we'd all recognize that if someone, if someone said look actually, I'd like to go for a walk before a meeting because I think it's really important to get out into a slightly different environment, we have a different calibre of conversation, I don't think anyone would go, that's ridiculous. So, none of these grey areas are helped by lazy terminology because we know that there are challenges around people recuperating, we know there's changes around contact time for people. We know that work environment plays a big part, but we also know that there are working dynamics within the economy more broadly and within organizations that mean you wouldn't want to end up with a completely two-tier workforce in terms of treatment. I'm going to bring down the tone a little bit and really draw on your expertise and experience on this one, but I think if there's one thing it's not hard to agree on it's that organizations should have a zero-tolerance stance on bullying and harassment. Unfortunately, we know from the CIPD's own evidence reviews and our ongoing work that conflict remains a continuing problem as does bullying and harassment, more common in the workplace than people would ever want it to be, it's been hitting the headlines again Strictly Come Dancing for those of you who may or may not be fans is a UK based show where people, celebrities, dance and the treatment of people behind the scenes has been something of great concern. With allegations of bullying and abusive behaviour by some of the staff. The common nature and persistence of instance even in really high-profile environments where you would assume that the scrutiny is massive. They're talking about in this case things happening, and it's been filmed, which kind of is even more concerning. Highlights that continuing issue but I wanted to have a conversation with you all about why it's so difficult to spot that, address that, have it raised and deal with that because it is one of the trickier things you can come on your career.\nWR: OK. So, I think we're evolving in the sense of what bullying means. I think the word bullying and harassment, of course there's legal definitions of the terms which we use to frame what is appropriate conduct in the workplace, but we haven't moved, I think you know I think where we are now seeing evidences or instances of bullying and harassment. There's so much more in this new world that we're now in, that encompasses that definition. So, for example from a race equity perspective you have things like microaggressions and gaslighting different terminologies which are new language that people are still kind of finding getting to grips with because we have a bit of work to do. And I mean HR folk to educate our organizations in terms of what that means for people and how that might show up for different people. So, I think the difficulty is also because we're in a cancel culture situation, right? So, there's two different elements of this one, is that you know for me anyway from a discriminatory standpoint, discrimination in the workplace is evolving at a rapid pace and I don't think our policies and procedures are keeping up with actually how to safely report these issues, what that looks like and also putting the burden of onus from the victim to actually what they're saying. So, when I use an example, you know, historically if someone's saying actually someone's being racist towards me, we would you know, to comply with the equality act and the HR profession, I think, and we are culpable in this, would be like where, like what's you know, what this that and the other, and I think that has to change. We have to go at it from position of trust, and also get the right expertise in to resolve those issues, which I think is two things that we need to navigate as HR professionals. Secondly, I think there's such a fear of, so this cancel culture. So, I think with such a fear of like oh god, if I've done something wrong or if someone if I behaved in a certain way. There's two sides to the coin, one is actually if I put my, if I speak up and I'm not then believed, then that could have an impact in terms of my career or my work, and that will have an issue because it's my living, it's like my livelihood, right? And the second impact of that is obviously the fear of, like, how that affects you in terms of career advancement and all that kind of other stuff. So, I think there's a lot of a plethora of issues that relate to the fact that I think we need to deal differently with how we manage those issues in the workplace, and those old rules that we currently have are, rules that are outdated now. I think they just need to be looked at, scrutinized, and reviewed for people to feel safe. We talk about psychological safety, right, in the workplace and it's become a buzzword, psychological safety. But this what you've just described is examples of psychological safety, it's about making sure people feel safe and understood when they're raising concerns in the workplace.\nJC: And I think it's much more challenging when the person who is being bullied, when the bullying is being done by somebody more senior, more experienced. I think it's much trickier when there is an imbalance of power in bullying scenarios.\nWR: As an upward.\nJC: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's much trickier and it doesn't matter, I've seen situations where somebody more senior has been bullied by somebody junior.\nWR: Yeah.\nJC: That is equally hard.\nWR: Yeah, it is.\nJC: To unpick and get, and I think Garin wanted to come in but I, you know, it's difficult.\nGR: Yeah. I'd be provocative, I don't think we're looking for it as I don't think we want to see it, you know. I think there's measures in place like you know engagement surveys and whatnot, as well. But they're often lag indicators, you know. They a lot of things have happened for that to show us a blip on a survey but if you really look and obviously, we're external people so we go in and you're looking for it. So, you can see it everywhere. And it's very subtle and I think the strictly thing is a real case study in terms of how you need to think about it because there's the individual that didn't report it because she was worried about her career and prospects and that. There's the actual dancers that were raised in a system where they were taught in that way, they were the victims of that, in the dance schools as it's been reported, and then you've got a high-performance environment which is can't fail, and so but it's kind of dressed up as a family show. So, it's like kind of we're a lovely warm family organization but geez we do some there's some things going on here. So, and I think the way in which we intervene so the way it's rolled out so far is that the dancers have taken the blame for it. But there's a systemic element to it as well and I think I was really disappointed with what Tim Davies said. I think he sort of said, I'm really sorry that anyone has had an experience that hasn't been wholly positive. So, that's really not where you start when you first hear it, you know what I mean it's like, how do we really get to the heart of it. And when you go into organizations it's so micro, it's like people just start to withdraw a little bit, you know, communications, cameras off, people communicating through Teams, Messenger rather than in-person. We just start to withdraw and that very rarely solves it. It just starts to sort of calcify the problem. So, we're not really looking for it. And I think if we wanted to, we could actually identify it. And I think incivility is like a really good way of defining the halfway house. Bullying has its own kind of feeling about it, but incivility is where people sort of exude themselves in a certain way. I think if we can really be clear with organizations and the world is full of behaviour frameworks that lay in drawers unused, no one knows. They don't guide behaviour. They don't guide feedback. Managers feel comfortable giving feedback about metrics, not subjective things like incivility.\nJC: But it's because you can't measure it. And incivility, that's such a good point and it's such a good way of framing it because some of this, at the heart of it is exactly that, incivility. But you can't, people, we don't, you know, most of us are not equipped with the language to be able to describe that. And because it's subjective, you can't measure it.\nWR: A hundred.\nJC: Right?\nWR: So true.\nJC: We, you know, the exact one, numbers. Where's the hard evidence to support X or Y? You can't measure that sort of stuff. It's a feeling. And when your antennae goes up and says there's something quite not right. You know, when you walk through a department or you walk on the floor, you're thinking, the energy's off.\nDDS: Yeah. When I used to run specific HR teams, one of the things I used to do, when someone joined the team, I used to say, look, we're going to work on your organizational antenna. I want you to be able to walk and get a feel for or to see two people in a room and go, there's something going on there. So, maybe I need to go and check with that. And it's, I think it's harder to do that when people are working remotely by multiples than it was before to have a feel for the space and the environment and the ecosystem that you're working in and the relationships between people. But I'm going to move us onto some happier stuff. I think just to, just to wrap things up, right. We're going to get into a good space on this one. So, British Airways has announced it will fully fund up to 200 places on its pilot training programme next year. Just to clarify, that's a training programme for pilots, that's not a training program that's being piloted. I'm not sure if they're going to do it in future years, in which case this is a pilot pilot training programme, but their pilot training programme in a bid to be social mobility and diversity within its pilot community. Now I'm really lucky because we were chatting about this prior to starting to record. The CIPD actually does some brilliant work in this area. So, we've got a dedicated CIPD trust. We gave 72 bursaries last year to people who couldn't afford qualifications to help them on their way in their career. We've got an aspiring HR director programme and 50% of the people who've gone through that programme have been promoted into more senior roles during it. And we also help with mentoring job seekers, parent returners, people with convictions, and refugees. So, there's some really, really good work, and I don't think we shout about it enough. So, since this is our podcast, I'm shouting about it. If you go, that'd be a really good space for the CIPD to be in it. We're in it. We need to communicate it more, but there's some good stuff happening if you are a professional on your behalf. But I wanted to generally talk with you all about your experience at that, but actually more importantly, that notion of social mobility and organizations and what organizations can practically do to shift the dial on it.\nWR: So, I just want to start with saying that I am a huge fan and advocate of, the Trust HRD aspiring HRD programme. I am one of those people that went on the programme and then secured my first exec HR director role. So, I cannot speak more highly of the programme and what Aaliyah and the team have done is an incredible programme. And I would say to anyone listening and really considering kind of that, that next step for them. I come from a working-class background. I grew up in a council estate, you know, there was a lot of, so I'm really passionate about social mobility. We were talking about this before the show. And so, I think, you know, it's really interesting because actually I work in a sector, so the charity sector, which is really middle-class and really white. And I've been doing some work with EY foundation on this recently. And I think, and Janet, you and I spoke about this, such an amazing conversation because if you can focus on social mobility in your organization, you will inadvertently address so many communities. So, you know, disability, ethnicity, gender through the work on social mobility. So, that's kind of where I'm taking the fight if it comes to the kind of, you know, the kind of, what are the, the top things that we need to focus on, you know, for our sector and for our organization. And so, I'm a huge, you know, huge fan of any programmes that can support that. So, one of them is the example, you know, for HR professionals is the Aspiring HRD programme. So...\nJC: And you know what, big up the aspiring HRD programme. I was a coach mentor on that and honestly, it was a privilege of my life to do it. I've thoroughly enjoyed it. And I, so big it up actually.\nDDS: That's lovely.\nJC: Yeah. No, genuinely.\nDDS: That's a really nice thing to hear.\nJC: Yeah. I found it. I loved it. Loved it. Loved it.\nDDS: So just to make this really practical, just to kind of start wrapping up on a really practical note. What's one thing that your organization has done, or your organization could do that you think would make a difference in terms of social mobility?\nWR: Advertise your jobs in places, in different places. Yeah.\nJC: Organizations need to approach this with honesty, transparency on authenticity.\nGR: Stop unpaid or low-paid internships and pay expenses for job interviews.\nJC: Yeah. 100% agree.\nDDS: Wonderful. So, I'm, I, I'm going to bring us to an end there. So, we've covered Love Island.\nJC: I love how you're bringing that up.\nDDS: Dialogico D, things that make people's toes curl. And we've finished on a really positive note with a kind of congratulations to British Airways on its non-pilot pilot, training programme.

My name is David D'Souza and with me hopefully for the entire duration of today's episode are...\nGareth Neale: Gareth Neale, I work at Crimson Hotels, I've had a career in retail and hospitality, and I've recently become a fellow of CIPD, I had an assessment, it was brilliant, Sue Hayes if she's listening helped me and supported me through that and I recommend anyone to do that in the future.\nVilma Nikolaidou: Hi, I'm Vilma Nikolaidou, I'm the Director of People and Culture at the British Film Institute with a background in the arts and the creative industries.\nDDS: And last but not least...\nMarkos Koumaditis: Hi everyone, hi David, thanks for the invitation, I'm Markos Koumaditis, I'm coming from the University of Oxford, and I work mostly in universities and government.\nDDS:    Fantastic, so as we're recording this, well first of all we weren't sure whether we were going to be able to record this because we woke up on the day this is being recorded to news that critical IT systems had gone down right across the planet. So, that was healthcare systems, news systems, banking systems, transport systems, most of the useful things. So, I'm delighted that we're all here now but actually we said that we cover kind of topical issues, this is happening right now. There's something really interesting around organisations being prepared for things like this. You wake up in the morning and the world is different to the world that you expected to come into. We've had a number of external shocks, some of them very sad and traumatic over the last four to five years. What's the role of HR in creating cultures and driving behaviours and processes that can help deal with issues like this? Vilma if I can come to you first.  \nVN: Compliance is really important. HR has got a big role to play in this. We know how important it is. It gets a bad name sometimes, although it's there to help us do sensible stuff that keep us safe and keep the businesses and the organisations we work with safe, like safety belts in cars and bicycle helmets.\nSo, we have a big role to play in that and make compliance feel not like a drug. And I think the second element of kind of culture change that we can actually influence, and we must, is the culture of urgency in organisations. If we're constantly chasing the day-to-day, we will never have proper time to consider what's coming and prepare for it.\nDDS: And there's a couple of things there, isn't there? There's kind of how do you keep things effective day-to-day, and then there's that longer-term piece as well. And the longer-term piece I think is quite often sexier, isn't it? You get rewarded for that probably in a way that you don't for not having a business continuity plan in place. It's one of those things that you notice it when it's not there and things have gone wrong.\nMK: Well, we had a massive pandemic, and I think it was very interesting the role of HR there because I worked in the House of Commons at the time. And from day one, everybody had a number of questions about what they're going to do, how they're going to meet, how they're going to progress the business. And we have to think on our feet of how to change the whole business model. In Parliament and the House service behind the scenes and use new technology, new ways of working. And we've done that. And that's where really the value of HR were actually kept a very calm and collected outlook on how you can manage your business and help your staff and your stakeholders to be able to execute them. But Vilma made a very, very good point. I think sometimes HR lacks this strategic outlook and also lacks the capability to convince the business leader that it needs to be part of the conversation about the future. So, I was listening to another podcast where people were saying, are we ready for another pandemic? And the consensus was that we're not. And I'm wondering sometimes if of the gains of the pandemic, the flexibility of working, for instance, are we going to lose that if we're not serious enough about how we're going to take the benefits and also, you know, question some of the things that probably isn't going to work in a more calmer times. So, HR really proved its worth during the pandemic. But I think in a times of peace, people forget again what's the role of the function.\nGN: So, I think it's really interesting when you talk back to the pandemic; I reflect back to what was happening in the business I was in at the time. During the pandemic, we'd never had anyone work from home. There was no such concept of remote working. Everyone's in the office five days a week, we hadn't tested anything to see if anyone could. And that in itself meant that we completely had to change our culture from the moment we closed the office, we tested Teams to see if that worked for us the day before. And also, we tested some of the remote working practices. So, I think the key thing that we are is a driver of the culture and able to support the cultural and cultural change. And I think that with this particular situation today, as an example, yes, you couldn't have predicted that there would be this security update that would affect a number of different systems. But what are your backups? What are the things that people can do? And equally, what are the reflections after this has happened? Are you actually getting people together to think about what is the, what are the business continuity risks going forward? What do we need to consider or what do we need to carefully plan out if something else happens? Because you might not expect that the exact thing that happened, like Covid or this particular situation today, but something will happen, so you have to really carefully think that through and work with people on that.\nDDS: I agree. I want to move us on a bit to a name that's often associated with crisis or drama, which is a leaked email has resurfaced. So, it's old news but in new packaging and we know that happens in the world from Tesla and ex-boss Elon Musk outlining a series of productivity recommendations for employees. And one of those recommendations was to allow people to walk out of a meeting or drop off a call if they felt that they were not adding value to that. Musk had previously defended the approach as suggesting it's not rude to leave, it's rude to make someone stay and waste their time. I was reading another piece which was some analysis from Microsoft looking at meetings usage post-pandemic, suggesting that actually, we've reached a tipping point where the way they described it was people spend more time talking about work than actually doing work. Now, I realise there's an Alanis Morissette level of irony that we're talking about this on a podcast, that's not lost on me in any way, we're having a podcast talking about whether people talk too much about work and we're considering that work, but it's a really interesting stance, I think because one there's something really important around culture sitting in there. Secondly, there's something around clarity. And thirdly, there's that drive for productivity. And we spoke about this beforehand and I think I was the only one who's done anything like walking out of a meeting, and I'm happy to talk about that. I didn't storm out; I have to be really clear, but I made it clear that the meeting shouldn't continue. I was wondering Vilma if I come to you first, but what are your thoughts on this?\nVN: I was thinking about this, it probably suits the culture of his company, it suits him as a leader, so before I should have judged. I will put those caveats out there. Yes, I wouldn't want anyone to walk out rudely, as you say, I think there's something around purpose and meaning here. And I think as leaders, we can set up a tone and purpose around meetings and role model how to have them being more meaningful with agendas with clear purpose and duration and good chairing to avoid anyone having to walk out. So, I think the things that we can do before it gets to that and if it does get to that then I think people should, should do it in a way that doesn't offend anyone. But I would put a lot more emphasis on the work pre the meeting.\nDDS: I had a flip of this actually I was chatting to a HRD last week and they said when they started their career, they worked for a CEO who used to lock the meeting room at the time the meeting was due to start. So, if you arrived a couple of minutes late you would just find that you weren't able to enter the room but they said you know, in terms of setting a tone for an organization, as soon as you started, you saw that for the first time, you recognized that actually turning up, seven, eight minutes late to a meeting wasn't an acceptable thing and that's the way the place worked. So, I was wondering do you think do you think those cultural strong cultural markers are useful or destructive?\nGN: Well, it's funny because my previous business, our CEO would if you're, every minute you were late for a meeting, you would be charged a cocktail at a future event. So, you'd have to buy everyone in the room a cocktail, so that would get people in a lot quicker. I just had a reflection if I just decided to walk out of this studio right now, you'd be quite shocked. Hopefully I don't know, maybe you wouldn't be.\nDDS: I'm thinking that through right now,\nGN: But I think it's the key as Vilma said was just preparing ahead of the meeting, thinking about who you're inviting, thinking about what the meeting's outcomes are and why you're doing it, and who would be the best people to be there. I think quite often, and I experienced this when I was freelance, there's this, people are doing large-scale projects and just think that everyone has to be there for every meeting. Whereas that's not necessarily true, and I think also think about how long your meetings are is it comfortable to be on a Team's call for two, two three hours? Well, obviously no. So, it's about thinking, that preparation and then at the end of the meeting, it's a check-in, how did that meeting go? You know, was it valuable to you? Did you find it useful? And if you're chairing that meeting, are the people actually getting involved? If they're not, then they why were they there? What is the real value that they're offering. So, I think there's lots of things to carefully think about when you're planning the meeting in the first place, but also allowing people to come up to you afterwards and say, I didn't find that useful, it's really important.\nDDS: So, and I'm hoping that you do stay for the rest of the podcast.\nGN: I don't know, it's nice, it's nice, sunny day today.\nDDS: There's an edge that we normally don't have in this podcast, just in case we'll see if we can keep Gareth engaged. Markos, just it's a general kind of question, I realise you can't speak for the universality of every organization. Do you think modern organizations get return on investment for the time they put into meetings?\nMK: That's a very good question, as you said it's really difficult to to answer that you know for everyone. I think the meetings for me it's a window to an organizational culture and and the leadership style and also the business models of place. If you work in a university, you conduct all your business through committees. This is our business model, we like it or not some of this is going to take forever, others going to be more succinct but, in the end, this is how you have to get through to get these decisions made. There's always things you can do for instance you know all my meetings are half an hour, 45 minutes. I decided when I go to the leadership position, if I'm able to survive this I need to get to see a lot of people, so I need to put some boundaries. Some people didn't like it but actually it works because if you cannot do your business in half an hour obviously there's a challenge and a problem there. I think for me, it's about values and behaviours. It's sometimes not what you do is how you do it. So, you can have conversations, you can have the best preparation about meetings, but sometimes, the meetings can actually show you that you don't know what you're talking about. You don't, as I said, you know, we discussed this before, if you don't have a clear plan, you don't have the resources in place, you don't know what you'd like to achieve. Probably, you try to cover all this gap in your business planning by having more meetings. And I think that's the question I will ask beforehand. What we try to achieve here, it is a better way to do this.\nDDS: Now, last week, maybe a couple of weeks back, we got an inquiry from a journalist at the CIPD around discrete reporting for microaggressions in the workplace. So, it was a legal firm that's launched a new way to improve relations in the workplace is the way it's positioned by introducing a new online platform to report unacceptable behaviour or microaggressions. So, it was described as a smoke alarm that exposes problems before they become severe. It's really interesting, by the way. If you are in a position where you're getting asked to comment on things like that, because one, you know that actually by the time it reaches print there's probably only two sentences from you or your organization. And secondly, particularly in a case like this, you're dealing with two complex things, would you like to see improved workplace conditions? Yes. Would you like to see people speak out more and have a safe environment to do that? Yes. But actually, broadly in organizational culture, would you like that addressed peer to peer, colleague to colleague. Absolutely, for the most part. And I think trying to find that balance is really tricky. I was really curious; Vilma think you said that you've worked with or in organizations in the past that have had similar reporting systems.\nI was wondering if you could bring it to life for us a bit, because there's definitely a trade-off in there, but actually it's a really interesting trade-off I think between two things that organizations would tend to want to achieve which is a safe culture but also a healthy collaborative culture.\nVN: Yes, and it's one of those issues in my career that I have shifted my position. I started some years ago, think with the view that this isn't actually a good thing for organizations. People should be able to speak up, we should be able to create cultures where people come forward and speak up and we know who they are, and they they give us the testimony and I have shifted my position and worked in a university where an anonymous reporting system existed. And actually, I supported its introduction because the world has changed a lot. I understood a lot more around power dynamics and how safety really works in organizations. So, I decided to see it as a tool for data collection or organizational culture. Sometimes it's very difficult to take any action on anonymous reporting but it does build a picture around your culture and therefore on balance, I think they can be useful.\nGN: I think the challenge is what you've just said there, Vilma, is that although you've got reports, it's what you do about it. And I think that's the really difficult thing here is someone reports something anonymously about someone else. How do you take that matter forward? And what do you do about that? It might give you a snapshot of the culture of the business, but really what that person's probably crying out to do is, I need a bit of help on this. I need some support. So, I think although this can be a support in some ways, I think it's far better to be able to have conversations with people, be able to open up, and also to recognize body language from people, whether that's within meetings or within just day-to-day interactions with people. And I think also it's about the training that you give and the support you give for leaders and managers in the business to ensure that they're considering the language that they're using, the way in which they work. I think all these things are really critically important. A reporting system will just simply tell you there's a problem, but the action points are sometimes really difficult to achieve.\nMK: I agree with that. I agree completely with that. I work in a university who have a similar system. And I think universities are still quite hierarchical places where the power structure is attached to the longevity of your position and your academic qualifications. So, in places like that, I think especially for people, who don't feel they have the power, it's important to have a forum when actually they can go and express their dissatisfaction or their experiences. That's why I always supported this mechanism. But the problem is, as Gareth said, what are you going to do about it? And I think in itself, it's not enough. You need to link it with other data, casework data, complaints, anything else, in order to improve your policies and actually put things in place. The most important thing for an organization is to hold themselves accountable and actually, turn the mirror on the senior leadership and say, this is, you know, the instances we have across the organization. This is the complaints and I'm talking specifically over the last 10 years about sexual harassment. After the #MeToo movement, I think across the university sector and many other organizations, that became the number one concern we had. And we had to react to this, and we have to really respond to this. So, I think it's important to be transparent and open. It's not easy. It's uncomfortable. But that's OK.\nDDS: Is there, because I think it's really interesting. It's one of those things, isn't it, where there is quite clearly, I think, a graduation. So, by that, what I mean is, it is probably clear and obvious that there should be an anonymous reporting mechanism on safe channels at the very least for people in situations of sexual harassment. If people have had a difficult altercation within a meeting, it's possibly less clear to think that that tool should be used for that. And I think that's the, I'm not entirely sure where or how you draw that line, but it does feel like it's a sliding scale, but there are also two different categories of things.\nGN: I suppose the question that comes to my mind is, what is a microaggression and how do you define that? And what would a microaggression look like versus an aggression or something that was outwardly obvious?\nMK: An example of this could be when you get someone's name wrong all the time. You send email after email, and you misspell their name. You never apologize for that; you never acknowledge this. And if you're in a position of power and this is a junior member of staff, they were never going to mention it and they're going to feel aggrieved and they're going to carry this. That's a very small example, but I think that's exactly the microaggression that we didn't consider 20 years ago.\nDDS: And there's probably, I would imagine, three of us on this podcast that have regular experience of that. I still receive emails, emails from people that I work with or have close working relationships with that don't get my name right. I imagine the same is for you. I imagine the same is for me. Gareth, are you all right?\nGN: Yeah, usually my surname usually gets misspelled quite often.\nDDS: You as well.\nGN: It's really interesting. You mentioned that. I think back to, I kept getting someone's name wrong and I kept apologising and I can never remember how they did it. And they wrote down a little note for me. E, f, a, efa. Because it's an Irish name and it can sometimes be, and that was, for me, massively helpful.\nDDS: A question for Vilma. What kind of stuff do you get from that reporting? Is there something that you found really useful and that you found that you've spotted a trend within those particular?\nVN: Yes. Yeah. I mean, in a large organisation, most universities are, you will get those reports in volume and then you start building a picture. I'm not quite sure how it would work in a smaller organisation. But it does, if it's handled well, it does create a culture of, you know, I'll raise this because it's worth raising and it's better than me leaving a meeting thinking, can I talk to someone about this? Is it in my mind? Have I imagined it? Will I be told that I've got a chip on my shoulder? So, we were getting a lot of things where people were giving us their names, and others were sort of small trends were discussed like precisely sort of the ongoing mispronouncing of somebody's name or misgendering someone, things like that..\nDDS: So, I want to bring us on to a different type of trend altogether, or a different type of trend spotting to finish it off, which is going into the murky world of social media. First of all, like, subscribe to this podcast. This is wonderful. Share it with your friends. Either handwritten notes to say, do listen to it, or make sure that you share it in your organisations. But I want to talk about the growing rise of #worktalk. #worktalk. For any of you who don't know, it's where things are becoming apparent on TikTok or catching on in terms of TikTok. So, some examples are, at your wage, so the idea that people should work in a way that's appropriate to the amount they're being paid. A raft of things under the quiet heading. You'll have heard many of these. So, quiet quitting, quiet hiring, quiet firing. We could probably invent another one today, which is, I don't know, quiet meeting, exiting. Rage applying, career cushioning and resenteeism. So, it's a really interesting one. Again, I'll come back to, we quite often get, as a professional body, ask questions around this. What do you think about this new trend? And I guess my take on it is quite often, they're not new trends, they're new naming conventions for those trends. However, that said, I guess if things are being amplified or people are kind of seeing resonance in things, there's something interesting for the profession as well there. So, Vilma, is this something we should be paying attention to? Is it something that keeps us connected to the world or is it something that we can just ignore because actually these are, old problems anyway and we're already working on them?\nVN: I don't think we should ignore it. I think there's something that people are saying there that we should pay attention to if you dig deeper, these things were always there. People perhaps weren't broadcasting them. So, what happens when they do? I remember an interaction with a new member of a previous team I managed that I asked the question, what do you think about this? And she said, I don't get paid enough to answer this question. And that was, that was about five years ago, and it stopped me on my tracks. I just thought I never encountered anything like this in my life. Was it instructive? I think it told me something about the relationship that people started having with work around the time of the pandemic. I don't know if it was coincidental.\nGN: What occurs to me is this is all about how you give employees a voice and give the opportunity to talk about things. I would rather know ahead of a situation or be aware of a situation coming up than someone doesn't tell me about it and just leaves. I'd rather someone says, this is a problem, or this is something I don't like. And I think it's about how you get people involved in that and how you can encourage people from all different areas of the business to be able to input into that. Otherwise, you just become any job anywhere. And I think that's the real challenge is giving people the opportunities to be able to discuss these issues, the things that matter to them, what they really like about the job, what they don't like about the job and what could we potentially do about this.\nDDS: So, do you think it's a healthy thing then that it's popping up and we're hearing about it? Or do you think it's unhealthy that it's not being raised in their workplaces and people feel that actually they need to talk about their work in that way externally?\nGN: Well, I think that people used to do this in the pub anyway. It's no different now. It's just that it is online, and people are sending out to more people. But you still talk to your friends if you've had a bad day at the office and talk about the bad experiences you've had throughout that day. And I think the critical bit for me is how you try and encourage people to be able to raise those issues sooner and be able to feel comfortable about doing it because that's sometimes the issue is people don't feel comfortable about saying, actually, I've got a problem, or this isn't working for me.\nDDS: Anonymous reporting tool being obviously one of the options.\nGN: That's one of the options.\nDDS: But not the only one.\nMK: But I think it's 21st century language and how people talk about their workplace and the experiences. I mean, Gareth mentioned the pub. I think most of my colleagues, my teams, they don't go to the pub anymore. They do different things. They experience life differently, which is, you know, just different. It's absolutely fine. And they're not going to go to the trade unions to become members. They're not going to respond to the traditional employee voice stuff, experience stuff. So, they're using social media because this is how they grew up, they grew up in social media. It's a whole different generation. And I know this is not about different ages and stuff, but I think we need to accept that the employee voice is everywhere. It can be quite fragmented, and you need to keep your ear on the ground of what's going on. So, for me, it's absolutely part of the wider workplace experience. And I wouldn't see it negatively. I wouldn't also overplay their impact. I think it's part of what you hear. You need to keep your ear on the ground.\nDDS: Yeah, it's really interesting. I think there's a difference between someone doing it for attention and someone doing it because they feel that that's a positive outlet for connection. And I think I've seen both. So, I've seen organisations slam for their recruitment processes in public. And you think actually, you could have just taken that up with the organisation. And you know, that's probably either an accepted practice or probably a more constructive one. But I've also seen things shared and we touched on actually since, really significant issues prior, where actually people needed to escalate outside their organisation for that to get significant attention. Vilma, final thought from you on this one?\nVN: I think as HR leaders, our job should be to create the best conditions within the organisation. So, these things get aired within the organisation and not just get aired but get addressed to the extent that they can be addressed. So, there is a constant sort of dialogue in the business around those issues. As Mark was saying, we can't stop it. It's there. Social media is part of people's life. We broadcast whether we, we do it all the time. So, I think I would rather put emphasis on creating conditions for people to do it at work safely.\nDDS: #worksafely #qualityofwork. Hashtag. Hashtag always kind of.\nMK: Hashtag enjoy yourselves.\nDDS: Well, or hashtag, you know, or hashtag pay for other people's cocktails.\nGN: Indeed.\nDDS: I don't know where you were working.\nGN: Oh, well, I'll tell you later. It's part of working in hospitality. So, the bit that occurs to me as well is that if you post something on social media, it doesn't necessarily resolve it. And I think that's the bit for me. Are you just airing your grievance and getting it out there and saying I'm fed up with this? Or do you want it actually resolved? And what we have to think about as HR leaders is how do we give people the opportunity to raise these things so we can help them and support them?\nDDS: And I think it's probably a good place for us to finish because I think it ties up actually neatly lots of the subjects we've spoken about. The question around meetings isn't around do you walk out or not? It's about how do you drive productivity? How do you make sure that you're making a difference? The question around reporting, as you say, is actually, OK, so what are you going to do with that information? And again, in this space, if you know about it, how are you going to shift the culture, drive the culture, drive change, to make that happen? And there are certain spaces where just having the voice doesn't make a difference and certain spaces where it should drive a difference. So that's all from us for today. I'd like to give my utter thanks to Markos, Vilma and to Gareth for sharing their thoughts with us, and Gareth for staying with us for the whole duration of this.\nGN: Am I allowed to go?\nDDS: We released new episodes every fortnight, so please do make sure to subscribe on your favourite podcast platform and recommend us wherever you'd like to. It's worth saying we had a conversation just before we started about the best HR films. So, it's a bit of CPD, whether you're a student listening or whether you're more experienced in your career and you want to get, you know, an extra jolt of learning. Two brilliant film recommendations. One is Up in the Air with George Clooney, where his job is the least glamorous of all, which is doing large-scale redundancies up and down America, but helping people feel good about that experience. And I always think it's a difficult part of the job, but if you can do it with dignity, that makes a big difference. And the second was Office Space, which is an unknown gem, but it's as good a film around workplace motivation and bureaucracy as you will ever see. So, carry on the conversations in our communities make sure that you continue learning, and we look forward to your joining us next time.

In this episode CIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza is joined by Vilma Nikolaidou, Director of People and Culture at the British Film Institute; Gareth Neale, Head of HR at Crimson Hotels Limited; and Dr Markos Koumaditis, Director of HR at University of Oxford, as we explore the top stories of the past fortnight, including the fallout from the CrowdStrike-Microsoft global IT outage, whether anonymous reporting of microaggressions a good idea, and if you should just walk out of unproductive meetings.\nRecorded: 19 July 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 3: A new UK Government and a 'New Deal for Working People'\nDuration: 00:36:00\nTranscript\nDavid Blackburn: Hello, my name is David Blackburn and it's my pleasure to introduce you to this edition of the CIPD HR People Pod Election Special.\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and welcome to this special episode of the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast bringing the topical stories and experts on the issues impacting HR, people practise and the world of work. This is a special today. We are recording the morning after the election result has come in, so they're still dribbling in the final results in the background, but it's covering the fact that we will have a new government in the UK. It will be a Labour government and we'll be diving into some of the detail around their New Deal for Working People and its implications for the profession. If you'd like to see more, then you can go to www.cipd.org.\nMy name is David D'Souza, and I'm joined by two senior HR professionals. One a Chartered Fellow at the CIPD and one a Companion of the CIPD, so I'm in lauded company today, to unpack what it means for employers. We'll be covering three specific areas that we know legislation is likely to change in, and we will also be speaking to a former MP about what it takes to get laws done and what we can expect to see and actually what it feels like to wake up on Election Day on a landslide. Before we kick off, I just want to explain a couple of things. So, the CIPD is politically independent. What that means is what matters is the impact of policies to us, not who is putting them forward. So, it's the impact on the world of work and the profession that we focus on. As the government settles in, we'll continue to engage with it as we have done in the past and we will continue to engage with the opposition parties to influence their positions as we have done in the past as well, on behalf of the profession and our membership. So, just before we get started and before I take you over to that exclusive with a former MP. I'd like to introduce our guests today.\nDB: Hi, I'm David Blackburn. I'm currently the Interim Executive Director of People at Mencap. I've been a member of the CIP for 21 years and have been doing HR for longer than I can care to remember.\nDDS: Which could be just two or three years, depending on how dramatic they've been.\nDB: Yeah. Yeah. Well, at my age, yes, exactly.\nDDS: And\nJo Carlin: Jo Carlin. I'm the Senior Vice President for HR Europe for an organisation called Firstsource Solutions. I've been working in HR profession for three decades now. Forever. Basically forever. I have been working in HR, HR lifer, I think I term. It's a term I've created myself.\nDDS: Excellent. So, I'm tired because I stayed up all night. You two just appear tired by life, actually.\nJC: Yeah. It's 30 years in HR.\nDDS: Just before we go into and we speak to our guest, former MP, how did you spend last night, David and obviously, safe for work comments though?\nDB: OK. So, watched, so my husband and I sort of split election night duties. So, I watched up until exit polls and a little bit beyond and then went to bed. He stayed on and then, I think, and he came to bed and then I got up early. So, I got up about 5:00 AM this morning to watch the, by which point most of the, I think we were waiting for about 40 results by that point. So, they declared it.\nDDS: I like that, I like that HR, so concrete shift patterns, you know in advance. You know exactly what you were doing then.\nDB: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.\nDDS: Jo?\nJC: Oh yeah. I was not as interesting as that, David, frankly, I went to bed with a peppermint tea, which is pretty much what I do most evenings. And then I got up at 4:15 and checked my phone and I was like, \"oh, yeah\", I mean, it was a little unsurprising, but yeah, that's what I did.\nDDS: Excellent. Thank you.\nJC: Peppermint tea and a book.\nDDS: Every night?\nJC: Every night.\nDDS: Routines and disciplines matter.\nJC: Yeah, apart from the nights when it's wine.\nDDS: I'm delighted to welcome to the show, a former MP to shed some light on what we can all expect in the coming months as the new government take forward their legislative agenda. Chair of the CIPD Policy Forum and former Labour MP, Iain Wright, welcome Iain.\nIain Wright: Thanks for having me.\nDDS: Really glad that you can make time today. So, we're the morning after the election, the results are just kind of finally trickling in, which is very exciting to get you on kind of live now. So, what about you? How did you spend your evening last night? Did you stay up glued to the screen or did you go to bed early and peacefully.\nIW: No, I was up till 5:30 and then just got about an hour's sleep before getting up to do this. So yeah. And you remember what it's like, you know, you are, you know, being driven on adrenaline and often really bad food as well when you're going through an election campaign, especially on election night. But yeah, I wanted to stay up to see this.\nDDS: And just going back to that time when it happened for you, do you sort of want to collapse the next day or does the adrenaline keep going?\nIW: It's a funny mix of emotions, actually, because the adrenaline has kept you going through an election campaign. It drives you forward for a bit, but then you crash. You need to have a bit of a sleep. I never did this as such. I know that I spoke to a number of colleagues on both sides of the House who said, \"I slept for the entire weekend\". You know, \"I was so exhausted that I just had to catch up\". I never did that, there's always stuff to do, there's supporters to thank, there's media to do, there's correspondence to start. You know, it's a busy time and it's especially a busy time for an incoming government and incoming ministers. But the adrenaline has pushed you through and probably will need to push you through for a little bit further as well.\nDDS: Fantastic. So, many of the people listening for obvious reasons, won't have been MPs in a landslide victory. So, what can we expect next? So, in organisations we often talk about that first 100 days, but it's been very clear that actually the government or the new government, incoming government would like to hit the ground running. So, what's the likely time frame for implementing elements of the New Deal, particularly those around employment for the profession to look out for?\nIW: Well, I think there are a number of stages. First is of course, the new Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, needs to form a government. He'll be doing that over the next couple of days, so the expectations will be, the cabinet will be appointed today. the junior ranks of ministers will be appointed on Saturday and they've really got to hit the ground running because I think there are two things to bear in mind. July, Parliament is often winding down into recess in July. It's going to be absolutely the opposite because, first the new Prime Minister will be going to a NATO summit on Tuesday, so he'll want to bring in the parliamentary Labour Party on Monday to give them, you know, a great speech to set them on their way. And then he's off on the international front. But then the other key point is the King's Speech on July the 17th. So, it's not long, about a fortnight or so where the new government will set out its legislative agenda and there'll be things in there, like the introduction of Green Energy UK, things like putting in place independence, full independence and publication for the Office for Budget Responsibility, an industrial strategy we'll put in place, and the establishment of a formal Industrial Strategy Council. But as you say, I think one of the big centrepieces of any legislative programme of the new government will be this \"making work pay\", having a New Deal for workers and I think that will be a key part of the King's Speech.\nDDS: And how will that, in practical terms, come into force? So, are we likely to see an Employment Bill with a kind of cluster of activity and changes sitting within it, and how likely will that, you know, be to be in the kind of foreseeable future or is it more likely to be policies being dripped in after consultation with industry?\nIW: It's going to be both actually, because I think what you will have is, you will have it as a big point in the King's Speech. You will have first and second readings, probably before recess at the end of July, beginning of August, if the parliamentary people can draft it appropriately. And of course, the civil service have, will have been working on Labour's manifesto on that. So, there will be a big piece of legislation, but also what Labour has committed to do is having, in conjunction with that legislative programme, a full and comprehensive consultation. So, there's going to be perhaps a summer and autumn of businesses, trade unions, civil society and I think CIPD needs to play a big role in this. In saying, \"well, these are our proposed plans, how do we put them into action?\" And so that there will be that twin track of consultation, a bit of a drip feed but backed up by a major legislative bill going through the House in the autumn and winter.\nDDS: Thank you, Iain. That sets the context brilliantly for the conversation we're about to have with some practitioners about actually the implications of some of that legislation. But I'm delighted that we've got you as the Chair of the CIPD Policy Forum to help us with that interaction and influence over government as we go forward. Have a great rest of the day and I hope you get some rest.\nIW: Thanks very much and thanks for having me, appreciate it.\nDDS: So, we've said that we'll continue to consult and try and influence government and one of the areas that, actually at the CIPD, we're delighted to see within Labour's manifesto and the New Deal was significant changes to the Apprentice Levy, which we've been calling for, for a long time, on behalf of our members, knowing that large amounts of funds don't get spent. So, we're going to unpack, as I say, several areas in detail. All of the other areas will be covered on our website, and we'll give you an overview there. But there are three areas that we're going through particularly and the first of those is the skills agenda. So, in particular, planned reforms to the Apprenticeship Levy funding and a commitment to a new Youth Guarantee. So, there are two things here, but in a nutshell, Labour have pledged to reform the existing levy into a more flexible skills levy available to employers. Businesses will be able to use up to 50% of the levy contributions to fund training opportunities that aren't apprenticeships, but additionally, a new Youth Guarantee Commitment will ensure training, apprenticeships or job support for all 18- to 21-year-olds. We've advocated, as I say, for changes in this space for a long time, and it aligns with quite a bit of the research and the calls that we made in our recent work with the Youth Futures Foundation. Jo, I wanted to come to you first because I know that you've had personal experience that you're very passionate about, of apprenticeship schemes. So, how do you feel about these changes?\nJC: First, brilliant, because these changes mean that we can do so much more with that, with that 50%, I mean, if we use 5% of the levy, I'd be shocked. I mean that 50% just means that we can go into different skills areas. There's so many emerging fields that are coming through that we're just not even considering. And then to get a formal apprenticeship, you know, organisation or companies set up in those type of fields, it's just insane. So, this is brilliant. I think for the young people, look, I am a, for those of you who are listening and are old enough, I'm an ex-YTS. Youth Training Scheme. For those of you not old enough, that's what it was called. And I think if it wasn't for that, that was my lifeline. You know, that was an opportunity to earn some money, learn some stuff and actually figure out what I wanted to do because I had no idea. And then I landed up in HR and the rest is history. But YTS, was not in HR. My YTS was in IT at a time when IT wasn't even a thing. So, I look at that and think, \"well, what could we do now with that levy, what could we do with that money to help the young people come in?\" And I think more responsibility on employers, for sure, to say, \"here, you've, we have this emerging issue in the UK with skills and with reskilling, reskilling and upskilling our existing employees\".\nSo, I don't think it's just about, you know, the kind of this youth reform, although that's critical. I also think it's about people already in work actually though that type of work changing and we're sitting here going actually we've got all this money banked and I'll use that word, it's banked that we can't really get to because we can't afford for people to take 20% of the time off the job. So, this is music to my ears and long may it continue. I'll be interested to see actually what happens with it and how far it goes. And I would push to say, can it be more than 50%? That would be my view, can it, you know be somewhere near 70 or actually why not just let us decide what we do with all of it? There's a radical thought. But I, you know, I guess that's that'll come.\nDDS: So directionally, a really good thing from your point of view?\nJC: Yes.\nDDS: Question marks, I guess over whether there can be more flexibility with it. David, what are your thoughts?\nDB: Yeah. I mean, I agree with Jo wholeheartedly. I mean, it's not just, I think about the skills of young people. I think reskilling, upskilling, you know, we know that by, I think it's 2030, you know there'll be eight, the World Economic Forum says 85,000,000 roles will be unfilled because we don't have the right skills. And we also know, you know, the frustration that HR practitioners have felt about the levy. Let's just be honest, I mean, the levy hasn't worked. It has not delivered what it set out to do and in some areas, actually, we know it's accentuated some of the problems. So, I think that I really like, and I agree with Jo about, there's something isn't there about how radical we want to be in this space, you know, and the problem, we know that we've got a problem, we've got a retention problem, we've got a tight labour market. You know, I'm currently working for a charitable organisation that provides social care. You know, the social care pathway skills for social care: massive thing. We could be really using that money, but we can't right now. We have a pot that we can't access, as Jo says. I really love Jo's suggestion, and I think we maybe should be advocating for that. That says, \"why aren't we being allowed to decide, actually, what we do with the whole amount?\" So, I think it's a great starting point. The other thing I'd say is that I think as Iain referenced, I think you know it does need to be linked to an industrial strategy. You know skills can't just be this sort of thing on its own. And I think maybe that's part of a learning from the Apprenticeship Levy. You know that we sort of said, \"we'll create a pot of money, we'll do these things\". Actually, it's got to be part of a bigger jigsaw, which is about, you know, UK PLC. That's what I think. But I do think Jo's right. I think it's a really good starting point.\nDDS: There's a really interesting point in there, isn't there, which is the eye-catching bit, is potentially the guarantee for young people, but actually the need for lifelong learning and reskilling is as, if not more important than ever. And we've got to join those things together and look, we, you know, as an organisation on behalf of our members and having heard feedback from our members, we've been calling for this, for long time, broken. You know, we haven't sat on the fence on this one. It's been a very clear thing that hasn't been working in the way it was intended. It's really good to hear that actually, I think, directionally it's going to move into a different place.\nJC: If I think about emerging skills and how can we use this pot of money? Because I totally agree that businesses should have a percentage of their salary bill taken in order to upskill and reskill. I think it's the responsible thing to do, absolutely. How we use it, as you said David, it's got to be up to us with some parameters. But if I think about the new emerging, you know, I mean, we can't get away from AI, you can't get away from digital , but there's also all segments of sector building up. And if I think about our sector, which is outsourcing, the traditional model is, we're moving away from the traditional model into something which is augmented with more digital, digitally enabled experiences and we, at the minute, you've got to find some way. You've got to find some money to pay for that upskilling en masse. So, we can't, you know, we can't play around at this stuff because we're getting left behind by other countries, so it has to happen. For me this has to happen fast. So, we can't be in endless navel-gazing debate about this. We've just got to move.\nDDS: Yeah. And I think that digital literacy thing is massive, isn't it, you know. So, you know, the Microsoft suite, you know, if you say to people right now, you know, you have access to AI tools on your desktop because Microsoft launched Copilot, didn't really tell anybody about it. You know, it's just there. You can, you know, can go in and get its right role profiles and do whatever you want, sort of thing. No-one's had any training on it or development, and if you do a thing, so actually in my time in the financial services sector, the Financial Services Skills Commission identified digital literacy as absolutely essential. Where's the money? To your point, Jo? I mean, where's the money to invest in that? And that's in all sectors, isn't it? I mean, that's not sector specific. We all need to be more digitally literate. We all, so we do talk about AI as this big thing, but actually the practical reality is, what skills are we developing in the workforce of today for tomorrow? Because we're already, they're already here.\nJC: I would add to it, David, just for a final point. I think digital skills are brilliant, but I also think we need to focus on our more behavioural skills as well because it's this, it's this latent ability. So, we have to think about the barriers, what stops people from playing around with Microsoft Copilot, for example? I was on it yesterday. I was doing some translation on it yesterday. It was amazing. But what stops people? And it's fear. So, I think, you know, we go to the skill first and then we try and say OK \"oh, it's not working\". Now how do? The adoption's not there? So, what do we do? So, I think having access to a pot of money that allows us to do both of that - perfect. Just give me more than 50%.\nDDS: Yeah. OK. So, I'm going to. I'm going to move this on, but it's nice to hear some accord and disagreement in the room. This is how this should work. There are a raft of changes that are coming through, we're not going to touch them all today. So again, if you go to www.cipd.org, you will find information on, you know, the range of things that we need to address actually, and which are likely to come in. So, that's union recognition, fire and rehire implications, changes to National Living Wage. Changes to, potentially, sick pay, zero hours contracts, a raft of things and right to switch off, which we actually covered in an earlier episode of this.\nI think it's episode two, if you want to go back and have a listen to that. However, one of the things that we know is most contentious for practitioners is the removal of the two-year qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims. Obviously, not automatically unfair, currently, just to clarify where the law is on that at the moment. I'm going to come to you first on this, David. What I think is portrayed in the media sometimes is that organisations treat that two years as like a kind of free hit and you know, just you have no rights in that period. When I speak to employers, when we speak to our members, that's not the way it's viewed, but there's a balance of risk here, which is really interesting. And I think, we were chatting earlier, everyone can understand the intent behind this, but what I really want to get into is the practicalities for employers and for practitioners. So, do you want to kick us off?\nDB: Yeah. I mean, we were laughing earlier, weren't we? Because, I mean, as Jo and I shared, as HR lifers, you know, I think we're agreed that the intent is right, but I guess my question is, \"what is the problem that they think? What is the problem this is seeking to solve?\"\nJC: Yeah. What's the question we're trying to answer?\nDB: Yeah, you know, I, because I think that is massively important for practitioners. And I'm also mindful, which is what we were reminiscing about. You know, cast your minds back to, you know, the previous Labour administration, 2004. You know, the Statutory Dispute Regulations, which on paper seemed like a really, seemed like a really good idea. You know, it's a great intention. You know, we're going to set down in law what the statutory process is for the resolution of disciplinary grievances and if you don't follow the, if you go wrong at any point and you don't follow the three stage process, the dismissal, the process will automatically be unfair and will bring the right to Employment Tribunal Claims. The industry absolutely said, at the time, HR practitioners, employment lawyers said this will be a disaster and the Labour government pressed on and ignored it. And what we saw was a massive increase in Employment Tribunal Claims. The system became overworked and basically it didn't work and so then it got revoked and I can't remember what year it got revoked about four years, I think probably. This has the potential to do the same exactly to do the same again. And I think that sometimes, again, I'm going to borrow with pride a phrase of Jo's. I might get it a bit wrong, but Jo was saying \"we need more than just, you know, these banner headlines, manifesto promise, state\".\nJC: I said, I said it's a poster. It's a \"poster quote\".\nDB: It's a \"poster quote\".\nDDS: You said it. I think more charismatically and eloquently as well, Jo. So, you know.\nJC: Yes, I did. I mean, frankly that's the case. Yeah. Absolutely. But, David, you can steal with pride. It's fine. I won't charge you later.\nDB: And I just, and I just think that's the. The reality is that we know that already. You know, we'd be much better off I think. There's this thing isn't it about prevention and cure? You know, are we focusing on what Jo was saying earlier about soft skills, you know, actually are we focusing on managers being better managers, having better quality conversations, all of those things so that they don't, because, to your point, David, I don't think that we use it as a free pass and you know, and if we are then I think that's probably not that, that's not the, that's not what the intention was.\nJC: I think, let's be honest, some employers will use it as a free pass, yeah? I mean, I think there's a reality, isn't there, that some people may, we don't know because we're not in all of those employers.\nDB: You flag it in your HR system, don't you? A little alarm bell that tells you.\nJC: Yeah. Well, you. Yeah, I mean, you're not, but again I echo your point, David, it's got to be, what's the question we're trying to answer with it? I'm not against. I'm not against, I suppose, most of what's in there, but if I take my organisation, for example, we took away probationary periods for a reason because we said, \"look, it's about the quality of the conversation, it's about the quality of the discussion and how well we are interacting with our employees and they are interacting with us\". So, we're not going to have them under duress during that probationary period because it creates a certain behaviour. So, we're like, \"look, we don't want to do that anymore\", but sometimes things go wrong, yeah? On both sides, and that's just the way it is. But now I'm looking at it thinking. \"Oh. OK, I'm going to have to put those probationary periods, right back in there.\"\nDDS: It is difficult, isn't it, to guarantee a match between an employer and an employee's expectations and organisations already put a lot of effort into trying to be transparent about what it's like to work here, because we know that someone joining and then leaving is both expensive and it can be disruptive. So, it's not like, to your point you've been working to try and resolve these issues anyway. There are potentially implications and changes that you would have to make if the legislation were to change in this way.\nJC: Yeah. I mean and look, let's be honest. I think we were listening to, taking Iain's point from earlier, it's likely it's going to come in in, you know, August, September, or something's going to happen in the autumn, which is going to be a very, it's going to be a very busy time for everybody, including HR professionals. And so, I like the intent, I think that's great. But some kind of, you know, not \"edge of cliff\" decisions would be great. And I'm looking at the CIPD to, you know, help do that actually with our new government. So, not \"edge of cliff\" would be fantastic, think a bit deeper. Nobody wants to get into the situation that we did. I am old enough, unfortunately, although I don't look it, but I am old enough to remember the reforms as they were. And you're right, it created chaos then with ACAS. So, ACAS are already stretched from the changes that have happened over the last maybe two or three, four years. What's going to happen now? You know I don't want us to get bottlenecked into conciliation and have all of our time spent focusing on that and none of the time spent doing the stuff that we really want to do, which is managing our people well.\nDB: And it's worth saying that it's not just ACAS, the tribunal system itself is completely overloaded. You know, on average in London, you know, you're talking 18 months to two years for an unfair dismissal claim to reach its tribunal date. You know, so adding more into that system, I'm not sure it's going to be the right.\nDDS: Yeah, it's a really interesting one. So, because we're talking about it, obviously from the practitioner point of view, but like you'll be in the same position as me that when someone finds out you work in HR everyone points anyone having an employment issue in your direction and then they assume that you understand the capability of the person involved and they go, \"they're my cousin, so they must be really good at it\". But it's that thing at parties. It's like that thing, when you get. You've been there, right?\nDB: You always slightly say \"Oh, I work in HR\", you say it quietly.\nDDS: But it's that thing, when they go, \"oh, these things are happening\" and you ask the follow up question, \"how long have you been there?\" and they can't see the relevance of that. And it's because people need to kind of understand those rights. To your point, Jo, it's, we really, we are entreating the new government to consult on this. We know that the perspective of our members is there, actually there will be consequences, and the preference is to either not change it, or certainly not change it to the level that is currently being proposed, and we'll make sure that we're articulating that in a consistent way. We've got some quite compelling statistics that would suggest it wouldn't be welcomed by the profession, but you've both made a point around ACAS and the tribunal system and actually, if you are in a position where your employer has done the wrong thing, potentially, how quickly you can access justice and the final thing I wanted to cover is: the new government. Do you see how I bridged that, that was quite?\nJC: That was amazing.\nDB: It's skilled, skilled, yeah.\nJC: Honestly, like professional, professional level.\nDB: Like he's done it before, Jo, I mean, it's.\nDDS: It's like we're on Good Morning Britain or something.\nJC: I know. It's no wonder it's in the top 10.\nDDS: And now over to the weather.\nDB: And that's before we've even been on it.\nDDS: I'm just proud of myself for that one and everyone can know it. So, the final piece I'd like to cover is how the new government plan to enforce and ensure compliance on these changes and the broader legal landscape. So, Labour has committed to establishing a single enforcement body which they say will strengthen the collective voice of workers and enforce and uphold workers rights. The new body would have the power to inspect workplaces and prosecute for health and safety, minimum wage, exploitation, discrimination issues with tougher penalties and personal liability for directors who break the law or fail to comply. I realise that's a lot of words, but the general gist is trying to get a more powerful body with broader oversight that can really make sure that, where things are going wrong, they're dealt with in an appropriate and swift fashion. So, Jo, I'm going to come to you first. Do you think those changes will improve employment standards in themselves? Do you think it's going to make a change and drive one?\nJC: The big question is, how are they going to enforce it? So, fundamentally, I don't think there's anything that you've said that I would be against. Absolutely, at the core of us, we should aim to be good employers. Where there are not and where there are things that are going wrong, my question is how are they going to do this? How are they going to enforce this in a swift? I think the point you made is, in a swift manner. So, it's not going to change anything if it's just a paper threat. If it's, you know, \"you do this, and we'll do X\". And I suppose that's my worry, with an already creaking system that surrounds some of these things, I'd be really interested in, that, that's fantastic. But what? How are you going to help organisations get better, because it's not always that organisations do these things because they are wanting to be bad employers. It might just be a, you know, they didn't realise. So what? What's that mechanism in order to get from where they are to where they need to be? I have to say at the minute, you know, I'm not seeing that, at the moment, helping organisations at all. You know, there's a lot more onus on the company, on top of all of the other things that are already based on, I suppose, you know, you can have a piece of legislation, but you can interpret it as you wish.\nDDS: Yeah, I know.\nJC: Loosely.\nDDS: It's a really key point. So, increasing enforcement and the pace of enforcement is one angle. Improving education is a key part of that, and that will be actually you look at SMEs and you look at their access to support and their access to understanding and some of our members do a great job, obviously, providing direct support to them, but that is a real challenge and you have to do those two things in parallel. And because the amount of organisations that, as you say, are almost accidentally not complying or there are some particularly technical elements that it's quite easy to fall afoul of. It's making sure that, not just pacing resolution, but actually that prevention piece in the first place. David, just picking up, you mentioned ACAS and their role in this. Again, I think there's a couple of funding questions primarily aren't there? There's funding for the enforcement piece and then there's funding for some of the preventative or interventative. Interventative, I've just invented that word and I'm patenting that.\nDB: Interventative?\nDDS: We are not taking that (inaudible)\nDB: That's our word of today, interventative.\nJC: Interventative.\nDDS: Interventative is now part of the lexicon. What do you think needs to happen on? I guess there's three sides to it. So, we talked about the education piece, the role that someone like ACAS might play and the enforcement pieces, what needs to change across that landscape?\nDB: So, I think Jo's right about, it has to be a joined-up approach. You know changing, you know, for me this feels, you know, it's a bit like, let's just get a bigger, better stick to beat employers with. I'm not sure that that's going to drive building better workplaces. And I, which is what the intent is. So, I think we're all agreed that that's what we should be trying to do. I'm not sure that, and I'd quite like the idea of, you know, maybe streamlining processes and having it all under one body. All of that makes good staff sense but we know it's not properly resourced and I do think, to your point, David, it's about. The education piece for me is the most important piece. You know the CMI did a study last year, the Good Management Report, and with YouGov, you know, and I can't remember the exact number. So, if I quote it wrong, apologies but it's something like you know 82% of managers in the UK have absolutely received no formal training and they talk about \"accidental managers\", and we also know that SMEs make up a massive part of the employment landscape in the UK.\nSo, if you're an SME with an accidental manager who just gets things wrong, not because of their intent, but because of lack of resources, lack of training thing, they can't get through to somebody at ACAS. You then saying, \"well, we're just going to beat you, beat you up more\". I mean I'm not sure that's going to, that's so I do think how you put the pieces of the jigsaw together is the most important bit and I guess that's, sort of, my sense about all of it. You know, Jo and I were saying at the start, you know, I applaud the Labour government, you know, Labour for having such a massive set of statements about employment. It's really refreshing, you know? That's great. That's news for us as HR practitioners. God, we're going to be busy. But I mean, I just, but I think that, you know, you can't rush. You know, I think there's this desire, isn't there? I can't remember who it was, it's either Barack Obama or Tony Blair, you know, in that \"I wish I'd done more in the first 100 days\", that's where the 100 days thing comes from.\nJC: Obama.\nDB: Obama. And they're now all obsessed by it, aren't they? Oh, my God. In the first 100 days, we must do, you know, crack on. Well, we're not going to fix all of the employment issues in the first 100 days and actually so I think that's, you know, it's got to be part of a joined-up and it's reassuring that Iain says actually in the King's Speech, they really want to talk about the industrial strategy, because for me, that's the missing bit that we've not had or not had a sense of. How do skills and enforcement and law all fit together? Because our aim surely should be, if we build better workplaces, we drive productivity.\nJC: I was having a conversation earlier actually around.\nDDS: You were up at 4:15. You've had quite a lot of time since you.\nJC: Oh yeah, I've had loads of conversations earlier. Yeah, it just.\nDB: She was doing star jumps on the train wasn't you.\nJC: I was doing walking lunges at Preston train station. That's how I spend my Friday mornings, David. But I'd say we were having a conversation. I was having a conversation with someone earlier around the kind of green reform and what that means as well, and how that might generate jobs, generate income. But equally, as we get more complex, so all of the things that we're talking about, all of the legislation, all of the pieces of the puzzle, they're getting more and more complex. And going back to this SME point, I'm a Non-Exec Director for a County Football Association, Lancs FA. I've just given them a bit of a shout out.\nDDS: Many of our listeners are big fans.\nJC: Big fans of Lancs FA. Yeah, I mean, don't tell them, but what I know about football you can write on a Post-it note. The CEO, if you're listening, just close your ears at that point. But I'd say that, you know, my experience with them has been quite eye-opening because it's so complex and you don't realise it because you've lived it. But it's so complex to navigate your way around some of this stuff and then to layer more things on top without the education piece, without the, you know, kind of dispute resolution being a full circle of learning. It's just not going to get any better for people.\nDDS: So, I think I'm going to bring things to a halt here because I think, I know we could keep talking forever.\nDB: Oh, I wanted to say something really important.\nDDS: But like, do you know what? We'll bring you back and we will showcase that in a later episode.\nJC: Just you, David.\nDDS: So, there's a couple of things I need to give a plug, David mentioned. David mentioned skills and HR advice in small enterprises. We've been running a scheme for a number of years and we're just kicking off the next phase of it, called People Skills, which looks at the value of HR advice in those. So, if you're an independent consultant, we are genuinely working on the evidence to make the case for the advice that you provide to organisations in a really structured way. But the really interesting take from this conversation for me, is that there's alignment around the intent behind a lot of what's here. There is an alignment around, actually, directionally these are some of the things that would have to, but it's the unanticipated consequences. And it's making sure that you're not capturing or altering practising good employers instead of bad. And the final example I'd make, you know, our position on zero hours contracts as an organisation, which is evidence-based and you can, you know, look at the reports we've done over the years, has been clear that they provide flexibility, but where they're exploitative they're absolutely disadvantageous for the people involved and shouldn't happen. And it's getting that nuance into all of the policymaking to make sure that actually getting that balance between not creating less positive conditions whilst you're attempting to stop some of the behaviour that I think we'd all agree shouldn't happen. So, final thing I'd like to do is thank both of our guests today, long night for some early morning for others. So, thank you very much, David.\nDB: Thank you.\nDDS: And thank you very much, Jo.\nJC: Thank you.\nDDS: And please do continue tuning in. It's delightful, as Jo mentioned earlier that we are high up in the charts at the moment. It makes us feel very funky and valued. So, please do tell your friends and tell other professionals about this because we want to keep bringing you the news as it happens or just about. So, you'll be listening to this just after the election. This is pretty much live from the morning of the election. Thank you very much.\nWhat can employers expect from the new Labour government's proposed 'New Deal for Working People'? CIPD Director of Profession David D'Souza hosts former Labour MP Iain Wright, Firstsource Senior VP HR Europe and Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity Jo Carlin, and Mencap Executive Director of People David Blackburn, to explore the implications and impact of potential day-one employment rights, apprenticeship levy reform, and how quickly the plans may come into effect.\nRecorded: 05 July 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 2: Relationships at work | Mouse jiggling | Therapy dogs | Summer of sport\nDuration: 00:32:46\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and welcome once again to the HR People Pod, the CIPD's fortnightly podcast, bringing you the topical stories, expert insights about the world of work and HR and people development. My name is David D'Souza, I'm Director of Profession at the CIPD and I've got two wonderful guests who are both Chartered Fellows with me here today, absolutely wonderful people. I have Gemma Dale.\nGemma Dale: Hello, I'm Gemma Dale. I'm a Senior Lecturer at Liverpool Business School. Before that I was in HR for about 20 years.\nDDS: And David Balls.\nDavid Balls: Hi there. David Balls, Chief People Officer at Newcross Healthcare.\nDDS: Before we get started, just wanted to ask, David, what have you been watching, reading recently? Tell us a little bit about yourself, give us a bit of insight.\nDB: It's all about the \"House of the Dragon\", back on TV as of this week. It's the second episode on Monday. I've been waiting all, I think it's about a year or two years, actually I think since the last one. Love \"Game of Thrones\", loving this. So, yeah, that's what I'm into at the moment.\nDDS: Excellent. I'm looking forward to seeing it. I've got it recorded, but I haven't quite got there yet and Gem.\nGD: I have mostly been reading a book on crypto, called \"Number go up\", just finished that and now diving into new Stephen King.\nDDS: Excellent. And they book on crypto, is it how to invest, how it works?\nGD: More a little bit like how to avoid the scams.\nDDS: How to avoid the scams, I am more than happy to share with people. I made a medium amount of money on crypto and then lost a medium amount of money on crypto very rapidly. It was a, it was a roller coaster journey having had a tip off from a cousin, who I don't speak to anymore. We're going to come back to, later on this podcast, as I say, obscure Japanese TV programmes, but also sport. But one of the things that's caught people's eye over the last few weeks has been BP staff concerned about a crackdown by the organisation over workplace affairs or what might be called intimate relationships, depending on how it's framed. As always, we'll be talking about the generality of the policy rather than the specific story, but this has got our thinking juices flowing. So, what's happened is that in 2021 the BP CEO left BP following serious misconduct over his failure to disclose past relationships to the board. BP are now asking for relationships between employees going back as far as 2021 to be disclosed. In a recent poll by the CIPD, more than 30% of respondents said that a policy is needed around romantic relationships for leaders and managers. But a further 50% said it's needed generally to avoid conflicts of interest or bias. David, just coming to you first, and it's really important when we do podcasts like this, not talking specifically about BP, but generally, your thoughts around things happening in this space. Should organisations have policy on this? How? Is it intrusive? Is it practical?\nDB: Yeah. Look, I think having a policy around relationships feels a little bit dated, with the amount of time that we're now spending in employment and at work. You know, relationships are going to happen. I think the issue here is about what are you trying to protect individuals from, and I think the two that immediately come to mind are sort of conflicts of interest, as you say, or corporate governance issues. And then the second one is any sort of harassment at work. And as long as you've got policies around that and you're managing within that context, I think we're fine. So, you know, I wouldn't have a manager and a subordinate in a relationship where they're signing off expenses or complex packages of activity where there's financial implications because, clearly you could find yourself in a position whereby it's being signed off for the benefit of both of them. But look, you know if a manager's going out with someone in a different department and they're a consenting relationship, then I don't see the issue.\nDDS: Yeah. And I think it's a really important point actually when we talk about conflicts of interest, perceived conflict of interest is something that we need to be concerned about as well.\nDB: Yeah, I agree.\nDDS: So, even if people are in a relationship and do play things perfectly straight, how that looks matters as well.\nDB: Agree. Agree. Absolutely agree.\nDDS: Gem, what are your thoughts?\nGD: Well, we love a policy in HR, don't we?\nDDS: Addicted to them.\nGD: But it's the easy answer, it's the easy answer, isn't it? You know, let's write a policy for everything and you just end up with documents that nobody reads. So, I think, you know, note the point we need to be mindful around things like harassment. We need to think about power imbalances. But you know, you can't have a policy, you've can't document absolutely everything. So, if you try, you just drive the thing underground and you end up with unintended consequences. So, I'm a bit more, I think in general in favour of treating people like adults, and if there are issues that arise like that, you know, the example of signing off expenses inappropriately or something like that, we've got disciplinary policies already that that would fall into. So, I think unless you've got a very good reason why a policy like this is important because of your particular organisational context, it wouldn't be my first choice.\nDDS: So, real life example, years ago I was working at the same organisation as my wife. And we were going through redundancy programme, and I was managing that redundancy programme, but I would have happily made my wife redundant, and I don't mean that in a callous way.\nDB: Does she know that?\nDDS: Yeah, look, we take this job seriously, right? So, that's what you sign up to. But quite wisely, my HRD at the time went, \"look, actually you probably need to be removed from this for a number of different ways\". And I guess to your point, Gem, it's people being open enough to have those conversations and it's probably harder, to your point, when people might not be aware that people are a couple or to that point. you know that I guess expenses is a very clear line, but actually how you assess someone's performance when you're in a relationship with them is more problematic. Would you still say, Gem, \"no policy for that?\"\nGD: Again, I think it does a little bit depend on your context and, you know, I'll throw this into a slightly different space. I work in higher education. We have policies that says, you know, if you are a lecturer, for example, you can't have a relationship with somebody that you're supervising as a student. So, you know, there are times in certain contexts where policies are important because there's a power imbalance. But as a general rule, unless you need one, let's just not write more and more policy documents. It's not really where HR add value.\nDB: I think, you've pointed there though, Dave, you made it earlier, around perception is key in this as well, isn't it, which is I think I think if you found yourself a manager and a subordinate having a relationship, they'd probably want out in the open anyway for both their benefits, you know? They don't want people looking from the other side of the fence saying what's good and what's bad and, in that situation, if it was happening, maybe something would happen with the relationship. But, going back to your performance review, for example, I'm not sure either party would want the other party doing their performance review. So, I think the more open you are about it and the more people know about it, the more organisational activities that could impact on both of them can be amended or changed to suit the circumstances.\nDDS: Yeah. And we all have friendships at work as well, don't we? And we expect people to still be able to make rational logical decisions and set them to one side.\nGD: It is a slightly different point, but I don't think there's any issue, generally, in sort of reviewing the performance of one's spouse. You know, in terms of, you know, DIY, contribution around the household, that sort of thing, I think you know that kind of performance management is perfectly acceptable.\nDDS: Quarterly basis? Or are you suggesting that's sort of more of an ongoing conversation?\nGD: Definitely the feedback should be in the moment, David.\nDB: I agree. In the moment, definitely.\nDDS: OK. And look, I'm going to come back. We're going to move on now, but I'm going to come back to that notion of kind of slippery slope definitions. So, when is a friendship or a casual relationship an intimate relationship? We're going to come back something similar later in the programme about, actually like, where do you draw the lines on some things? Because I think it's the, it's part of the art of the job. But I think it's also some of the areas where we'll naturally disagree because it's more subjective. Next headline that probably would raise eyebrows in a slightly different way is. \"U.S. bank fires, mouse jigglers pretending to work.\" So, it's a story that the U.S. banking giant, Wells Fargo has sacked several employers who were faking keyboard activity to fool the company into thinking they were working when they weren't. So, companies have been using more and more sophisticated technology, particularly where people are working from home to ascertain whether they are still contributing, when they're still active, but what's also happening is that people are starting to use technologies to essentially fake the work on the far end. Before we get into the nuances of the technology. Is it right or wrong, I'll start with you, Gem, to monitor employees in the first instance?\nGD: I guess that we're into what do we mean by \"right and wrong\" there. Are we thinking about this in a purely legal sense or are we thinking about this from a sort of morale, engagement, you know, being a great place to work sense. So, you know, from a legal point of view, as long as you are following GDPR and, you know, information governance rules and things, you know, you can monitor people. Of course you can. But just because you can doesn't necessarily mean that you should and.\nDDS: Gem's just basically stolen my line which I stole from somewhere else there and I'm feeling slightly bitter about this, but we'll continue the podcast. That's fine.\nGD: I think, you know, my broad question with that is, if people feel the need to use one of these to sort of, you know, have productivity theatre, what is going on in your organisational culture?\nDDS: But is it? So, the challenge back to that right would be, it is clear in this case that people are faking work, they're getting paid for stuff that they aren't doing. It's harder for an employer to spot that because they're remote, it feels a reasonable check and balance. It feels an unpleasant one to have to put in. But equally, how else would they have told that? I'd have liked to have thought there are other indicators around productivity other than whether someone's mouse is moving. You'd have thought that there are other output measures there, but David, I don't know your thoughts.\nDB: Yeah, that's exactly where I am, because when I read this, I thought, \"what's the world coming to?\". You know, look, organisations have every right to put in monitoring software, right? But that says something about their culture and how they view the individuals that are working for them, and you choose whether you want to work in an organisation, right? You know, last time I checked there weren't, you know, bars on the door that stopped people getting out of, in out of the companies they work for. And if you work in those organisations, you should accept that's part of what you're doing. And then to, to then have some, you know, some way of, nefarious way of trying to show your boss that you are working. Just what a waste of time for everyone. So, I think my points there; the first one is: choose the organisation that you work for and if an organisation, I think to, to Gemma's point. If the organisation is saying we want to monitor our colleagues, what does that say about what you think they are doing and the engagement levels within that organisation? But look if you choose to do it for a lot of the right reasons then as individuals, you should accept you're in that environment and do the work accordingly. I wouldn't be trying to circumvent it.\nDDS: It's a really interesting development in terms of technology, isn't it? Because the parallel I've drawn, and it's not a perfect one, but it's, I'm talking to recruiters who are seeing cover letters or CVs coming in that they believe are produced by ChatGPT. But we've also got that in kind of academic environments with students doing that. So, then you've got people trying to produce software to track that and then you've got people trying to produce software that evades the software that's there to track that and it feels like, to your point, we're getting away from the simple, \"look, how do you tell someone's doing a job?\" Well, there should be an output.\nDB: Absolutely. And I think this is where the world is moving on, right? So, take an example, you said there about covering letters. If you think they've been done by ChatGPT, why have a covering letter then? Why not actually ask the person to come online and talk to you directly so you can see that that's the person you're talking to and ask them, yeah, you know, to tell you a little bit more about it and I know, it's clearly. It's an application process, it's about a funnel, the numbers, etcetera, etcetera. But yeah, if you're not getting what you want from a covering letter, don't just keep pursuing it because it's the way we've always done it because the world is moving so quickly now. Look at different ways you can get to the same output.\nGD: I think the mouse-jiggling thing specifically. Employees will respond to the organisation signals and the situation in which they find themselves. So, if the organisation is assessing productivity by how many e-mails you send, how much time your Teams colour is green or how responsive you are to a message coming in. Then that's the signal they will take. That's what, how they will see I'm going to be judged as being successful, so they will respond accordingly. So, they will, if necessary, demonstrate that and I saw another example recently. This idea of we just don't know really how to manage and assess productivity. So, it was an organisation that had pushed for a return to office because they'd identified that when people were working from home on a Friday, for example, they were sending fewer e-mails. Well, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing less work. They might be doing different work, they might be doing deep work, they might have saved their, sort of, focused work. Equally, they could be watching \"Homes Under The Hammer\". But employees will respond to the signals that the organisations give them.\nDB: There's an intersection here which, we've touched on it a little bit, and I think this is one for another podcast maybe, but the, you know, with the advent of AI and what people will be able to do with AI and organisations. If you're worried about them not logging on or doing the work at home. If you're going to give them access to AI, you should be really worried. If they're, if they're finding ways to get round, you know, logging on and logging off, they'll find some interesting things to do with AI when they get access to it.\nDDS: Yeah. And we will, we will keep diving into that. We'll keep coming back to it in the podcast. So, at the moment, CIPD, we've got kind of four clear areas of focus. One is: champion the profession, we've got productivity and skills in there, workplace conflict. And we're just going to come on to that next, actually, but also AI because we know it's changing the way that people work. So, I am going to bring us onto workplace conflict next, or a version of that which is, we had the CIPD's Festival of Work recently. Really large show, brilliant attendance this year, but we had a journalist who attended who wrote a follow-up piece, essentially asking, \"does the world need therapy dogs or does it just need good old-fashioned management skills?\" I had a really good conversation with them. It was about \"quiet quitting\" and that notion, and I said like the noise around quiet quitting, it's possibly overwhelming some really important conversations that we need to have about quality of management, quality of support in organisations, what we need to drive productivity. So, there's some stuff that catches the eye on social media, catches a lot of attention, but actually it's getting in the way of some of the bigger things that we need to talk about. But there was a really interesting piece where he was essentially observing the shift that we've seen in organisations to providing more well-being services, to providing things to support colleagues, either through difficult times, financial or it might be mental well-being and stress and performance. Do you think that is a healthy evolution for the HR profession? I'm going to ask two questions. Do you think that's just where we are societally at the moment in terms of that need being greater than it has been before? Gem, if I come to you first.\nGD: As a general rule, I have no issue with, sort of, secondary well-being interventions. So, whether we talk about therapy dogs, whether we talk about other support that organisations can put in, like financial support, that help people to stay well. So, they're a good thing. It's easy to criticise them and say, you know, massage at your desk or whatever is not going to, kind of, deal with work-related stress and that's true. I think where things fall down is when we don't do the other stuff, which is we don't look at the potential causes of ill health within our organisations, when we don't look at things like leadership and management and try and prevent that stress from arising because the secondary interventions on their own will not help your employees to be well. They can help people, you know, with, you know, small issues or, you know, help them to stay well broadly. But I think we just need to lift that conversation and look at those more strategic things. And yes, that does include how we lead and how we manage.\nDDS: Yeah, it's a really interesting one, isn't it? I always think that you need things within organisations that compensate for problems and mitigate problems, but they can't. They're not the solutions, they are compensatory and mitigatory. So, the work that you have to do has to be on reducing, getting to the root cause and reducing the need for those things. So, I think the interesting thing about the chat I had with the journalist was just reflecting on how much, how many of these things are things that happen outside of work perhaps or impacting people outside of work, that we then can't separate them and ask them to be entirely different in work. You know, you can't leave all your problems at the door. You can ask people to do that, but we know that if someone's in financial hardship or someone's suffered a bereavement, that's going to spill over and has an impact. David?\nDB: I've got to declare a conflict of interest here, as the father of a dog that's in training to be a therapy dog. My wife runs a unit for children who have behavioural difficulties and maybe school-refusers etc. and our dog, Loki, goes into that school on a daily basis. And she will talk about stories where children will come to the school purely to see Loki, yeah? And that breaks a barrier, right? That breaks a barrier, so where am I going with that is, I think as we're talking about here, and I agree with what Gemma said earlier, which is: there is the first thing which is getting people over a threshold into the organisation or, you know, into the environment and if bringing your dog to work helps you achieve that because it gives you a sense of comfort or trust or what? Yeah, whatever the adjective is you want to use, then that's great, right? We should, we should encourage that and look at many different ways to get people to feel comfortable in the workplace. But that's not going to address underlying issues if management or leadership aren't leading that organisation in the right way, or if people aren't engaged, or if there's poor management practices. And you've got to address those at source.\nYou might want to put in things like employee assistance programmes, but I think the issue with those is, and I've always said this since they've been around is, you're saying to a person, \"you've got a problem, call this number and we'll do something about it\". Yeah. And that just feels wrong, doesn't it? Which is, if we're seeing people struggling in the workplace, for whatever reason, and it could be because of something that's happened outside of the organisation, because you can't just switch off as you come to the boundaries of it. We should be trying to help them, right? What does that look like? That looks like just great management. You know, people sitting down, talking to them, trying to understand, looking at solutions. Sometimes you won't have the solution, but just trying to work it through with people's got to be the way forward.\nDDS: Yeah, it is. It's a stretch, though, isn't it, for the profession? Because we're not trained counsellors, we're not trained social workers. So, knowing when to refer, I think, is an important thing for, it's an important thing, actually for the people that we're supporting within organisations, it's important for profession as well to draw that line as to where it can.\nDB: I agree, two points in there, David. I think it's really important. First of all, we don't have all the answers and I'd say to any practitioner in the people function, you don't have to have the answers, right? We had lots of challenges through the COVID period where we were being asked on a daily basis to make decisions which we had no idea about. That's fine, right? We can try and give the best ideas and the best solutions we can, based on our experience. But sometimes we just don't know the answer. That's fine. And the second thing you said there that's really important is something like the difference between coaching and counselling, yeah? At some point in a coaching conversation, you can go to a very, very dark place and you are not qualified to have that conversation. And in actual fact, you do a disservice to yourself, but more importantly, a disservice to the individual, and it could be very clinically, quite challenging. So, at that point you should drop out and pass it on to someone who's more professionally qualified.\nDDS: Completely. Gem, any final thoughts on that?\nGD: I think you know, we know that the role of managers has such a huge influence on people's health at work and I think if there's one thing organisations absolutely should do, it's make sure that they are providing training, guidance for managers so that they understand things like signs and symptoms to look out for of things like poor mental health. Know how to have those conversations and also know how to lead and manage in a way that isn't actually going to have a detrimental impact. So, I think if there are things to do, that's one of them. You know, easy to criticise, but if the therapy dog's going to help or indeed a massage at the desk or a lunchtime Zumba class, do that too.\nDDS: Absolutely. One thing the CIPD has, which we really hope people make use of and we know they do, is we've got a really substantial range of fact sheets and guides on the issues of the day as well as reports that come out on a regular basis. What we don't have is a fact sheet on the obscure Japanese TV programme \"Massage Detective Joe\", which I really want to try and find a way to link from that because I only found out about it this morning and just the idea that someone's written that, produced that and got it funded, I find absolutely amazing. But I want to get from that to a conversation around treatment of sport and entertainment in organisations. So, I'm going to see if I can do it. So, \"Massage Detective Joe\", and the clue's in the title. It's a whodunnit, kind of, Colombo-type show based around someone who uses their massage detective skills in a massage parlour to solve crime. And in episode 7 of \"Massage Detective Joe\", they use their massage skills, advanced massage skills to work out that the perpetrator of the crime is a professional Kabaddi player.\nNow, many of you may not know what Kabaddi is. It's actually one of the biggest sports in India and Bangladesh. Easiest way to explain it is, it's like dodgeball but without the ball. You have to try and tag people on the other side and get back to your side and that knocks them out. Historically you had to repeat the word \"kabaddi\" many times to prove that you weren't taking a breath, that was part of it as well. But the world Kabaddi Championships take place next year and I imagine there aren't too many conversations around whether we should be giving employees time off to watch the world Kabaddi Championships, whether in fact, you know, organisations need to be more sympathetic with people coming in the next day and they're quite tired. But we know, with the Euro's kicking off and the Copa America and other large-scale sporting events, it's the Olympics and Paralympics this year, that those conversations are coming up in the workplace. So, I wanted to ask both of you, look, where do you draw the line? Where do you start considering it? Do you think it's a requirement for organisations to support? Gem, I'm going to come to you first because I know you wanted to wedge in Roller Derby as well, but from your point of view, you know, this comes, we always have sport in the summer. It comes up, it will be a question for workplaces. Where do you stand on it?\nGD: Well, as somebody that does play a niche sport, I have some sympathy with the view that it's about more than just those really, really big events. But you know, we've all seen this conversation, I think probably every time there is a major sporting event, it's a common HR conversation. I think I'm going to, if I can, link this back to my area of interest, which is flexible working, which is, you know, we still have this view that a lot of knowledge work has to be done Monday to Friday, 9:00 to 5:00. We're still kind of hardwired to a system that evolved from the factory system. Frankly if people want to watch a particular sporting function, or indeed anything else, go to, you know, their child's sporting event at school, go and do something else that's more life-related, it doesn't have to be sport. If we think more broadly, if we give people flexibility, if we're open to things like non-linear working days, it becomes less of an issue. And frankly, if you can't do anything else and you worry that people are going to call in sick, which is the thing that I see mentioned all the time, put a big screen in the office.\nDDS: Yeah, it's really interesting. At the CIPD, I can guarantee each year we'll get enquiries from the press around, \"how do you manage Christmas parties\", will be a big one. What happens with sport in the summer will be, kind of, the other one that you can kind of appreciate that rhythm. David, what are your thoughts? And I know we spoke a little bit. prior to this podcast, around different environments we've worked in so contact centres, retail, if you need people physically on-site, it's a slightly different challenge, isn't it? I know Gem kind of mentioned knowledge work, specifically but we've got a challenge with everyone in the workplace.\nDB: First of all, I'd like to congratulate you on the segue. I think you pulled it off.\nDDS: Thank you. I'm. I'm not sure. I'm never going to listen back to this, so I'll never know. But if anyone doesn't, then please do phone our Contact Centre and complain. Just not, just not during the match.\nDB: But no to the more serious point, I look, I think, there are things to take into consideration here clearly, which is you know different types of workers can have, work in different ways and it's easier for some to accommodate a event of whatever kind. So, if you're on the phone every day or in a call centre, it's very difficult to take people off the phone for 90 minutes and allow them to watch a football match. Whereas you know, if you're working in more of a support-type function, you know, people function, for example, it might be easier for you just to slip off and watch 90 minutes and make that time up at another point. So, I think, not only is it role-specific, but then the impact between roles. You know, because clearly if you're a frontline worker who's facing off to the customer and seen to be generating the revenue, if you can't come off to watch the game yet, someone in a support function can, that can create some tensions. So, you've got to be aware of that.\nI think the other thing with any big event and let's take sports as the conduit for this point. Which is, you're bringing different types of people together in an environment where emotions will run high. We know certain countries have histories, we know certain individuals from those countries have history with each other and throwing them together in a field way with watching, watching football, for example, can cause that stress or tension to overflow. And you've got to be cognisant of that. And then the final point I'd make is: you know, when you're bringing groups together, invariably sporting events again, you know, you might encourage people to have some social time together, which might include alcohol. Again, if people are driving to the office, how do you manage that? But my overarching point would be the same as what's been made by yourself and Gemma, which is, you know, we should encourage people to work flexibly, and we should encourage people to enjoy these events. We shouldn't just have a classic 9:00 to 5:00. And if something sits in that period of time, you either call in sick so you can watch it, or you don't watch it. I think we should find ways to try and work around it. And I think organisations should try and address that by having, you know, groups of colleague representatives who can act as a conduit or as a way to manage this. So, you know, open the debate up with your colleagues. What are the important ones? If it's, you know, if it is Kabaddi's the most important event and it's not the Euros. Kabaddi should be the one that we give people time off for, but have that conversation with colleagues, get it out in the open. Let's find a way of managing it with the people that we work with in an adult way.\nDDS: Yeah. And if you've never seen Kabaddi. It's worth searching for.\nDB: I used to love it.\nDDS: On YouTube, I'm not pushing it too hard on this.\nDB: It was fantastic. It used to be on Transworld Sport on a Saturday morning, so if you're from my era, you used to get up early and not have anything else to do except watch Kabaddi on Transworld Sports. That's where I got it from.\nDDS: We're actually now plugging TV shows that don't even exist anymore.\nDB: Oh sorry. Yes, other TV shows are available.\nDDS: So, yeah. So, just kind of, digging into that a little bit more because I'll come back to that kind of slippery slope piece. Where do you draw the line? Are you both saying that actually a line doesn't need to be drawn, it could be done individually more than anything? Because I think one of the things that I think is really interesting at the moment is we're resetting the expectations, I think. The kind of social, psychological contracts between employers and employees, a lot's changing. It's not really a reasonable contractual expectation that I get to watch sporting events that I like, when I like is it? You wouldn't, you wouldn't go actually, \"that's a duty of an employer\". You would go, actually that's an additional benefit or level of flexibility an employer could provide. So, is there a line to be drawn or is it just look, \"this is just good judgement and it's about the individual organisational culture?\" Gem?\nGD: I would say the latter and I think you know the pandemic has had an influence on some of the things you've just said, David, this kind of reshifting this reemergence, I think of some aspects of the psychological contract. And that we are starting to see research emerge now that says you know, that was a fundamentally, a time of reflection for a lot of people, they have rethought about what they want from work. They've rethought about the place of work in their lives and that's part of the sort of, the push to work from home more frequently. So, I think, within the constraints of each organisation and noting, you know, that there are some roles, some organisations, some job types where you've got to be in-person, you've got to work at a specific time. But the more we can allow individuals to craft their work around their lives, the more we allow them to have that flexibility, whether it's a sport, whether it's family issues, caring, whatever that looks like. The better that's going to be for the individual from a well-being perspective, from an autonomy, engagement, all of those things. And in turn that has greater organisational outcomes. So, my argument is always; within the constraints of your own environment, maximum autonomy for that individual to shape how they work, when they work, where they work, and noting that's an ideal scenario and it's not achievable for every job. But I do believe that, within most jobs, there's some way of allowing individuals to craft, you know, some elements of that.\nDDS: If we are essentially leaving it down to the individual, how are we going to make sure that actually the parameters that we set for the organisation and the individual don't end up in competition with each other or don't end up causing issues?\nGD: I'm not sure you can leave it solely down to the individual. I think it's a conversation. The more you can devolve down flexibility from the high-level policies to the line, the better the outcomes generally seem to be, from the emerging research around things like engagement particularly. But you know what's right for an individual will sometimes disconnect with what's right for the team, what's right for the organisation, what's right for you know, cultures and relationships. So, I don't think you can just purely go, \"you know, it's over to the individual\". I think it has to be like a team conversation, a manager conversation and all of those people that. There's, you know, there's not always a Venn diagram where everybody's kind of completely happy and there's a circle in the middle that's perfect. You know, we have to kind of balance those stakeholder needs within that conversation.\nDDS: Yeah. So, I wanted to close with the final thought on turkeys, which just I, thank you. I like to think we've really covered a breadth today. But I think, from memory, it was kind of the authors of \"Freakonomics\" described it in terms of the pact and the contract that people make with organisations. I thought it was quite an interesting one to think about, which is, it was a turkey farmer who gave his workers a turkey as a Christmas present one year as a thank you for the year and it utterly made their day, and they were really thankful for it. The next year, slightly tougher, he gave them a slightly smaller turkey. And all he got was people absolutely aghast that somehow what they've come to expect had been removed. And I think we've got some really interesting changes happening in the workplace at the moment where we're trying to find that balance and a lot of the change and a lot of, I guess the, the bartering in the nicest possible way, the resetting of those parameters is seen as a loss, rather than actually still, quite often still beneficial to the employee over time, really fascinating relationship. Nothing else to do except to plug the CIPD's resources, suggest that you keep listening to this podcast because we got some great guests coming up and thank our guests for today, for being so patient and allowing us to roam across a vast range of things from \"House of the Dragon\", to jiggling, to roller derbies to, and I know you're all going to go and look it up on IMDB. It's a real thing. \"Massage Detective Joe\". Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Gem.\nGD: Thank you.\nDDS: And thank you, David.\nDB: Thank you.\nDo romantic relationships at work need to be disclosed? Can you trust a 'mouse jiggler'? How do you manage time off or flexibility around major sporting events? Join the conversation with David D'Souza, CIPD Director of Profession, Gemma Dale, senior lecturer at Liverpool Business School, and David Balls, Chief People Officer at Newcross Healthcare Solutions, as we unpack the topical stories over the past fortnight and look at how HR can consider their impact for their own organisations.\nRecorded: 21 June 2024\nHR People Pod - Ep 1: Leadership | Privacy | Second Jobs | Disconnecting\nDuration: 00:27:47\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello and a big welcome to the HR People Pod, CIPD's new fortnightly podcast, bringing you the hot topics, expert insights, and stories on the issues impacting HR, people development, and the world of work right now. I'm joined by two senior HR professionals in the studio here today, and I'm thrilled to say they are:\nKatie Obi: Hi everyone, I'm Katie Obi, Chief People Officer at technology company OneAdvanced.\nDDS: And.\nMelanie Steel: Melanie Steel, I'm a Career Interim\nDDS:   And just a reminder for everything that we discuss today, we'll be talking about the general principles of what's happening. You all know, as experienced professionals, that it's very difficult to know what's going on behind the scenes. So, we'll take the stories as a jumping off point for our discussions. I think broadly today we're talking about the difficulty of boundaries in work and working life. So, we've got a few stories that have caught people's attention over the last few weeks that talk about that. Where you draw that boundary, that kind of final line in some different aspects of work. And I know, Katie, if I come to you first, one of the things that caught your eye was a recent product launch which suggested some interesting balances between where we get value from something and the implications on privacy.\nKO: Yeah, absolutely. There is an interesting discussion that was happening, you know, across some of the social media channels, really about Microsoft's product launch around a product called Recall, which is really connected to its Copilot product, which goes and takes screenshots of your computer screen at various intervals throughout the day. And the aim is really for this to be a productivity tool to help you be able to search through everything that might have happened during the day and really get powerful recall of information. One of the things I think is really interesting about this is, there are obviously real productivity gains that can come from that, but there are also significant privacy concerns for employers to be aware about as well, in terms of what information is being captured. The information is being stored locally on someone's device, but who can access that device? Whether that changes in the future as well. So, that was a really interesting one for me in terms of trying to think about, as an employer, what do we need to be able to balance as new technology comes into the market and really making sure that HR populations are educated around positivities around productivity and advantages, but also unintended consequences before these types of things are rolled out.\nDDS: So, Mel, I'm really curious. What do you see is the opportunity in it? So, if we have both the opportunity and the risk, I think that's probably the best way of giving it some balance.\nMS: I guess it can be useful, if you are thinking about something that you did, you know previously and you can't quite, we all know like search engines or kind of filing systems are always, you put in keywords, and it still doesn't really nail it. So, I guess that could help with that. When you said productivity, I was thinking about those people are there where you're thinking about something, and it takes a snapshot and then two hours later you've still got a blank page. And then whether, you know, employers go, \"well, that wasn't very productive.\" You know, \"we've got these different snapshots in time and it's still no words on the page\". I mean, I've felt like that sometimes when you're doing like, you know when you're trying to brainstorm something, but also then I kind of think about the security implications of that, right? You know, in government, I'm sure they would be able to switch it off or something, but you know, you're cleared to a certain level to have access to certain information, quite rightly so and therefore you've got the whole issue then about how you protect that if it's taking a snapshot of sensitive materials and what have you.\nI mean, I guess what Katie said is like something that starts off seeming like a great idea, which reduces time in being able to circle back around to stuff, what's the unintended consequences of having that that ability too?\nDDS: Yeah, and it's key that the profession I think is really cognisant of both those opportunities and risks. You know, I often say we can't let the risk blind us to the opportunities, but we can't let the opportunities blind us to the risks either. And I think it's going to be one where, as the technology is moving at such a rapid pace, to your point, Katie, we need to do two things. We need to go, \"this is exciting because we've never been able to do this before, so what might it allow us to do in a different way?\" and to your point, Mel, yeah, I'm sure I spent a large chunk of my professional life staring at a kind of blinking cursor going, \"I hope something's coming next\". But equally, the ability to track down documents you haven't seen before, pull together information in a really rapid way would be really useful, but you've got those implications you need to think about in terms of how it's going to be used within the organisation, what the implications are for security as well, and I think there'll be a range of products, I'm sure, continuing to come out in that space that it'll be worth practitioners thinking and reflecting.\nMS: Just like one last thing, before we move on, on that is we talk about practitioners, but there is a bit about everyone's responsibility in it. Because I think the days of like, you know, HR, we've tried to move away from being like the policing and policies and such like. What we need is to educate everybody, right, within that, you know, managers, individuals have to take their own responsibility about these things that will come through and it can't all rest, I don't think, on the HR profession to be the ones who are thinking about the unintended consequences as well. You know, it has to be. We've all got to be because it's moving too quick, right? Otherwise, we force, I think the function back in that thing, it's not that we don't see things as a positive, but we can't be the only people that are thinking about the flip side to it.\nDDS: I absolutely don't think it's about identifying the downsides. It's about understanding how we harness it really thoughtfully. And that has to be cross organisations. But we've got, you know, we've got a core responsibility around change management, our expertise in that space and we'll come on to talking about a few stories where actually we've got choices and influence around culture as well, and some of those boundaries. But you're absolutely right, it's not a, it can't and doesn't all fall to us, but I think we've got a really critical role to play.\nMS: Yeah, for sure.\nDDS: And a really exciting one as well because lots of things we talked about five years being theoretical and now actually arriving month by month, as opportunities for us to deliver and make a difference with. Moving on a little bit, but actually there is a slight link here because I've spoken to quite a few people over the last few years who believe that some of their employees are working, effectively, a second job, but using AI to do that, or some who are suspecting that, in fact, people are delivering a large chunk of their core job using generative AI, in particular. Notable cases in the U.S., I think where most of the anecdotes are streaming out of, but certainly it's come up with me with a few HRD's and again that feels like a, feels like a message from the future, doesn't it? Actually, this person's juggling different jobs, but they're using technology to do it. So, one piece of news in the last fortnight. A recent study revealed or suggested that, in particular, Britons have become a nation of side-hustlers, which I love as a headline. So, partly in response to the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, people of all ages. So, it's not just kind of limited to kind of one demographic, have increasingly sought additional income streams. So, sounds like a good thing? Sounds like a bad thing? Sounds like a necessary consequence of where we are?\nMS: I mean, listen, as someone who started, I worked like two jobs, you know, when I started my career, there was no way I could have afforded my rent and stuff on a Civil Service salary at the time. And I did many years actually with a second job, doing waitressing. That's what I needed to do for me. And I think like there's multiple issues within that kind of statement, as you were saying. So, I believe in the right that people should be able to do what they feel is right for them and their family and such like. Obviously, there are certain jobs where you need to ensure that people aren't, you know, doing stuff which might impact on intellectual property and such like that, and therefore they'll have stuff in their contracts. But also, I am sensitive and I have been sensitive, you know, over the last few years with the cost of living rises, people who are in, particular maybe minimum wage type jobs. When you know senior folk are publicly talking about the bonuses and such like they're making, about them thinking about, you know, is that, are you taking account that some of your workforce are having to use food banks or do multiple jobs not by choice, but just to put food onto the table. I think there's a sense of responsibility in that one that, you know, they need to be cognisant of what's going on in their workforce.\nAnd actually, it's quite interesting sometimes they're not always so in touch with that. I saw Emirates this week had had record profits, and they'd decided to dish out additional bonuses to the rest of the workforce to share in some of that success. So, I think there's that piece about making sure, if you are making money in business, are you making sure that that's going to those who may be struggling, you know, and having to use food banks and stuff? And when you're talking in the press about mega bonuses and mega profits, so that feels a little bit out of touch. And then lastly, I love a good side-hustle. So, you know generations who have decided that actually they want to do that. I've had lots of conversations with clients who are saying, \"look, I just don't think this is right because they don't have this, you know, they need to reserve their energy for the \"day job\"\" as they call it. I always challenge them to look at it about how can they bring that side hustle expertise and what they're doing, running their own mini little (inaudible), how they're doing their marketing. I mean, there's some really good, brilliant skills. Some of them have been doing it since the age of 14 and stuff as well. I'd be like, \"hell, that's great. Let's bring that into the workplace. And how can you help us with some of those things?\" So, for me that kind of is a far-reaching kind of bit and I know we don't have a lot of time with it, but that's just my thoughts on it.\nDDS: Katie when we, Mel mentioned there, you know, the expectation of a leadership team, to come back to that notion of boundaries. Is it reasonable or is it old-fashioned for an organisation to think like, \"I'm buying your focus rather than just buying your time\" because and we'll come on to it when we talk a little bit about right to disconnect later, but there's a really interesting notion there, isn't it, which is; if I employ you, does that mean that essentially your contract is solely with me and that's where your attention should be all the time? Or actually is it, look, there's contractual hours and that's pretty much the deal. What are your thoughts?\nKO: If we think about second jobs, people who take them, I think, fall into three main categories. Obviously, there are outliers. The first one, as Mel talked about in terms of a necessity to work a second job in order to be able to make ends meet, and that's obviously exacerbated with the cost of living. I also think there are, there has been a breakdown in terms of the employee/employer relationship in terms of job security over recent years. So, lots of people are taking on a side hustle because they want to build the security in case something happens to their main job and then they've got something that they've started to build that can see them through a period of unemployment. Or they're starting to build something out on their own in terms of building their own thing. We've got lots of people who opt out of the workforce over time because they want to have more flexibility and be more in control of their own destiny. But I think there's a third one, which is, there's a difference between having a side hustle and moonlighting in terms of taking on a second job during core work hours, maybe working for a competitive element.\nMS: Agreed, yeah.\nKO: Which comes in a bit more to your question, David, in terms of what happens if a side hustle moves into that realm? And I think that's where the boundaries need to be, from an employer standpoint, and it tends to be contractually what we put in people's contracts to be able to prevent. So, side hustles that actually aren't competitive, that are happening outside of core work hours, I don't think employers should intervene around this. I think people's time that we're not paying for should be their time to be able to use on something that doesn't cause damage to the business.\nMS: Agreed, yeah.\nKO: I think that's entirely different than people who decide to take on multiple concurrent jobs and they use their work time that an employer is paying for in order to be able to do those. I think that's unethical from an employee standpoint.\nMS: Or it impacts on that day job because they're like, tired or not, you know, I think about if you're a driver or something where you have a safety element, you probably have got something in your contract about that, right? And the rest days are purely meant to be for that. So, if a pilot, you know, has rest days, you really don't want that pilot to be doing stuff which kind of zaps them so by the time they come on shift, you know, they're less capable than what they would have done. But I mean you have to be clear about that of what you're talking about.\nDDS: Yeah. Look, my time as Batman obviously left me quite drained the following day quite often. But sticking with this notion because I think there's a really cool thing in it, almost everything we're talking about today, which is that employees have rights, but they also have responsibilities and the same sits for employers. And working out the balance between them, either in terms of the actual contractual terms or in terms of the social contract, implied psychological contract that we have. There are shifts in that balance recently and lots of organisations are struggling with where to draw the line. Another headline that's kind of stood out over the past few weeks is the growing number of European and South American nations, primarily, but not exclusively, that have now adopted \"right to disconnect\" laws. So, essentially prohibiting larger employers from contacting their staff outside of normal working hours, so if you like the flip of the problem. It's about actually the employer asking for a bit more or an expectation outside of that contractual piece. In Portugal, breaching the law can be punishable with fines up to EUR10,000, so a not insignificant sum. Is this a legislation piece? Is this an understanding, an employer piece? Katie, I'm going to start with you. But I think again, it's in that rights and responsibilities bit, isn't it?\nKO: Yeah, very, very interesting. We're seeing more and more countries go down this way. So, clearly the legislators think that there's a legislative element to it. I have mixed views on this, so on the one hand I think where it has not been possible to self-regulate around making sure that work is sustainable and healthy for people, maybe there does need to be legislation that comes in. But I'm also worried about unintended consequences and as soon as you legislate, rather than do it on a company-by-company basis, then it becomes a mandate and there's flexibility that's lost. The number of people who come to me and say, \"I have commitments outside of work and actually it's really helpful for me to maybe finish a bit early so I can do some caring responsibilities and then I come back on later at night\" and I do this. If you put in legislation, that means that after a certain time of night, no e-mail can be sent to somebody, it's punishable with a fine, and it's essentially illegal. Then that takes away an element of flexibility. So, maybe there are unintended consequences associated with it. So, I think. I think, always wherever possible, companies should make sure that they're setting themselves up for providing good work environments, and they are trying to balance employee and employer needs without the need to have to legislate. But we're also so integrated now with technology and expectations that it's interesting, the lines are blurring more and more socially and for individuals and yet we're starting to see more and more boundaries being enforced as well to separate it out again. And I don't think we've necessarily understood the pros and the cons associated with both.\nDDS: It's a really interesting one for me because we're going to come on to talking about working from home, but not in the way that people may expect, because we want to look at that though a slightly different cultural lens. But there have been bits, if I think even in my career, early in my career. Might have been shift work, might have been doing a role which didn't require that carry-over responsibility. So, you've done your work for the day and then you go. That's an interesting piece of even legislation to look at because when you think about the beneficiaries, it's unlikely to, for someone to be in an industrial or retail setting, you know, doing that type of work. This is more likely to be impacting office workers, I would think, and we'll talk about the flip as we come on to it around different sides. But, Mel, I know you've worked across a range of different industries and sectors. Well, what are your thoughts on it?\nMS: I fundamentally disagree with it. I just don't think work should be set up like that. I'm also not naive to know that in some industries, in some areas that it's gone too far the other way. But with all of these things, what kind of goes to my heart, I think on it is, we really need to get to a place where frameworks are good in businesses, because actually having something from a starting point and a jump point, I think always helps. Legislation is absolutely right where we're looking at fundamental things which affect, regardless of what company you're in, should be there. So, I'm a big fan of legislation at the right time. But I think for me it's, I want to get back to this bit where there's a deal to be had between managers and individuals, because ultimately that's who you're working with every day and every business that I've been in operates in a slightly different way. Yes, you can roll it up at the macro level that you can say it's got so many similarities but at the micro level, individuals have different things going in their life.\nI think about it. Recently I was at a gym. I'm in the changing rooms and I hear like, particularly different generations. You know people in their 20s and 30s telling each other how they're going to leave a job because they just can't do the thing, which is very important to them, like go to an 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM class, which to me is not something that's a, you know, should be a deal-breaker because they're OK to work till like later on in the day. But they've been told they need to be back in the office, they've got to do these timings, and I feel like that's a step back. And I kind of hear and I want to will them, \"look, speak to your manager. There's got to be a compromise in this\". And I think, when I hear a number of these things, we have to make sure we empower the manager and the individual, because between them, to me, that's where it should work. Not for everyone, I appreciate that, but I think once we start legislating, you know, using legislation to try and do stuff we get into kind of that policing regime.\nKO: I agree and that's a great example because under that legislation there you can't, you can't as a manager be that flexible for that employee because you can't have them start late because they can't work later in order to be able to do everything they need to do. So, it limits the ability to match flexibility to individuals needs, and I also think, I've worked for a lot of global employers and it's very interesting thinking it from that lens.\nMS: Yes, good point.\nKO: Which is, you know, where, as a global employer are you going to focus investments in particular countries? And I think countries that introduce more hard and fast rules around this, especially with financial penalties, they may not be the countries that people invest in. So, there are also unintended consequences for individuals and employment in each of those countries as a result.\nDDS: So, there's been one organisation in particular making a number of headlines of late: Manchester United Football club. Their new owner has offered an early payment of an annual bonus if people were to resign this week as part of their drive to get people back into the office physically. So, that's an, essentially an incentive to people to make up their minds and leave if they're not going to be comfortable with that way of working. Now, we said we wouldn't talk about hybrid working per se, but actually it's a really interesting way of seeing an organisation being so decisive around culture, but obviously quite a controversial one as well. So, Katie, if I come to you first, what are your thoughts around how you'd set expectations more broadly, about the cultural norms within an organisation?\nKO: I think, on the one hand, clarity is really important and leaders need to be clear about what the organisation stands for and also what their position around various different elements are, because then people can make up their own mind about whether that works for them and whether that doesn't. And lack of clarity that can cause so much uncertainty as well. So, I always think being open, honest, upfront and direct about what the organisation will and won't tolerate is extremely important and it helps people to be able to make really informed decisions.\nI think also our duty as leaders and as organisations is to make sure that we offer good work, we're a good employer, we have well-designed jobs, we have strong collaboration and relationships, we're focusing on productivity, but we're also flexing to individuals needs as much as we can as well, is really important and one of the things that concerns me is, whilst I really believe that clarity and leadership is very important, mandates also. It depends on what is the motivation behind the mandate as well. If the motivation is for those elements of cultural norms that I just described, that's great. And that's a really good way to be, to provide bold leadership and clarity around what is expected in order to be successful in the organisation. If the mandate is for a different reason, then there are unintended consequences about that. If the mandate is just to be able to see people for presenteeism, you'll get presenteeism as the outcome. So, really thinking about what is the reason behind what you're standing for as an organisation and how you embed that all the way through end-to-end and then communicate with clarity. I think that's really where the role of leadership comes in terms of establishing the cultural norms.\nDDS: Yeah, because leaders and organisations need to be able to set out really clearly what they value, what behaviour they'll incentivise and what behaviour they won't tolerate. I think it's really important if you work for an organisation, you know what they want you to do.\nMS: Agreed yes. Yes.\nDDS: They know how they want you to show up. You know what you're going to get rewarded for. Yeah, it's the basic bargain, isn't it? And you talked about working for a manager and that importance of a relationship.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: I think everyone should know what a good job looks like.\nKO: Yeah.\nDDS: You know, and I think behind that, I do agree. Values themselves can be a little bit nebulous because the lack of congruence you often get between the espoused values and the real values. It's a problem for every organisation. And that means particularly if you make a difficult announcement. Sitting behind them is quite tricky.\nKO: Yeah, it's a really interesting one around, well, as we're talking about cultural norms, cultural norms aren't what you put up on the wall and the nice shiny things that you put on your website\nMS: Exactly\nKO: Cultural, cultural norms are more about, you know, how do people show up every day and also what's the worst behaviour that you'll tolerate and when you've got two really difficult decisions to make, which decision do you come to? That's where it really talks to what your culture is, what the leadership really value and I think as organisations start to navigate through some of these more difficult challenges around boundaries, that's where we're really starting to see what does an organisation stand for and what does it not and actually proactively thinking about that and communicating about that is a really good thing, rather than having it reactively done through lots of smaller decisions.\nDDS: Mel, final thoughts?\nMS: I think if, in terms of people going back into the office. I think we've distilled work down to task too much and we have to help people understand again, if that's what it takes, that work is more than just task. It's about relationships, it's about collaboration and I think businesses should be honest about that. And if they believe that's what they need for their business, they probably do. I read this week that someone had said, \"we need to earn the commute.\" So, they're investing hundreds of thousands of pounds in good office space so that people can work in a really great way. And I think we have to be bold to individuals and say, \"it's on them too.\" It's not a one-way relationship. So, you do the commute, but you also have to come in willing to be part of that workforce and show up and by that, I mean the willingness to collaborate, to build relationships. It isn't all like, you know, businesses give us the tools, but ultimately, we as individuals can do so much together too. And I can't help but feel like we've lost some of that.\nYou know, I'm not a fan of 100% of anything. So, 100% in the office or 100% working from home and I do want people to have flexibility because it really does hurt me when I hear people saying that they can't do certain things which are so important to them because, you know that's only going to impact on them and what they feel of that company too. I think again, frameworks are good. I think be bold, if that's what Manchester United need to do. Try and give the basis of why it's important and don't expect individuals to immediately agree that they think that's a great idea if they've been used to having, maybe more flexibility on their terms. We're humans, we don't suddenly, we change. We don't suddenly go, \"oh great, I can see the benefit that I can collaborate and that\", but many people I've talked to who have been made, maybe, to go back, have been able to see that actually, when push comes to shove, it is better and they can probably get back into that if they've still got an amount of flexibility. So, that would be my view on that.\nDDS: Perfect. Thank you. And a very clear one and to come back to it, I guess the point is be clear, be requiring, be considerate whilst you're doing that and if organisations can step into that space, employees can recognise their obligations as well within it, then that's probably your best way of setting your boundaries is doing that relatively collaboratively but with a lot of clarity. So, thank you to both Katie and Mel for their time today. We, as a professional body, obviously asked people to look at the evidence, make sure that they are focused on the outcomes that they're driving and to work to really clear principles. If you'd like to find out about our position on any of the topics that we covered today, please do visit the website. Otherwise, we look forward to you joining us next time for another stimulating HR People Pod. Thank you very much.\nMS: Thank you.\nKO: Thank you.\nDecisive or divisive, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's leadership message was definitely bold. Join the chat with David D'Souza, the CIPD's Director of Profession, Katie Obi, Chief People Officer at One Advanced, and Mel Steel, former HR director and interim people & transformation leader, as we unpack the biggest stories of the past fortnight including: is Microsoft Recall a privacy nightmare? Should we be wary of a growing trend of side hustles or second jobs? And do we need 'right to disconnect' legislation? Leadership like the Manchester United back-to-work offer.\nRecorded: 7 June 2024\nHR People Pod - Pilot Episode 2\nDuration: 27:29\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Hello, I'm David D'Souza and welcome to the CIPD's new fortnightly podcast bringing you the hot topics, expert insights and stories on the issues facing HR and people development practitioners and the world of work right now. Over the last fortnight, we've seen a number of stories surface on the theme of recruitment and we're going to touch on that today. Even the recruitment of a potential new leader for the United Kingdom.\nSo we've just had an election announced, and that's obviously quite an onerous selection process there. And we'll be talking a little bit more about selection as we go through. But I'm thrilled to say we've recruited an expert panel, today. And they are...\nMel Steel: Mel Steel, former HR Director, and career interim, specialising in change and transformation or, of late, specialising in travelling around and having a nice holiday.\nDDS: Yeah. So, Mel has a really horribly horrific, like, perfect glow about her at the moment. Looking really healthy.\nMS: Thank you.\nDDS: Okay. Al...\nAlastair Gill: I'm Alastair Gill. I've had a long old career in HR, and most recently I've set up my own consultancy doing coaching, working with senior leaders. But my expertise really is in leadership development, strategy, culture and engagement, which, thus, is about building the future of work.\nDDS: Excellent. cool. So we're going to get right into it. One piece of news that's caught people's eyes in recent weeks has been John Lewis taking an interesting step in sharing interview questions with prospective candidates ahead of the job interview. So, before you go to the job interview, you get a clear sight of the questions so that you can prepare effectively for that.\nWanted to come to you first Al, we had a chat just before this kicked off about actually understanding context that decisions are made in. So I'm wondering if you could just give your thoughts on that.\nAG: Yeah. At first my instant reaction was, oh my God, this is, this is crazy. Why on earth are they doing this?\nDDS: So quite positive there.\nAG: Yeah. Quite positive. So then you start thinking now, actually, why? You've got to understand why? What's the driver. What's the goal. What's the, what's the business trying to achieve in doing this? Or is this just some sort of crazy idea. So it's very easy to pick it apart and stuff. But my instant reaction was like, wow, you're giving everyone the questions before they come to interview. I can see the benefit of that. But that plus AI that sounds a little bit, a little bit crazy. So yeah, I think what we were talking about earlier is that you've got to understand why the business is doing this. John Lewis has been through a lot the last couple of years, so does it link with what the business is trying to do? Or is it just a sort of a vanity project from the team to create a lot of work? I'm not sure, but, yeah, it definitely divided my WhatsApp group of HR people.\nDDS: Mel\nMS: Yeah. No, I was like, okay, what is the story? Because I'm like, is this just some clickbait headline, first of all? Obviously, it's John Lewis. So, as a customer, then I'm thinking, okay, let me have a read and see, see what they say. I mean, look, I don't know why they decided to go down that route. Many businesses, I think if you go on their website, do offer, you know, example type questions of what they ask at interview. I don't think that's necessarily anything new. I know in the civil service you could go on and see what type of questions you might be asked. I, I'm guessing it's related to fairness and giving people the opportunity, who need it, to prepare for, I mean, we were talking earlier about as an extrovert it'd be my worst nightmare. Probably having, like, if there was pages of questions because my natural default is, oh, they'll expect me to prepare. And therefore, I think you can overthink it and maybe, you know, not get the best out the person on the day. But I think it goes back to the point. Not everybody's the same. So, they're doing it for those that need it, which I'm sure would be supported. I think there was quite a lot of positive stuff that had come out, in the press, from neurodiverse groups and such like, for those that don't, it's not a precursor that you've needed to go on it. You can equally respond, in the moment. That's kind of what I took away from it. That's what I took from it.\nDDS: Yeah, nobody's worse off and some people will be better off. That seems a good space to be in. And actually, I know what you're saying, that your initial reaction was like, here's a headline, but actually it's really nice to think that there's a team of people at John Lewis thinking through, actually, how they can support more people to show up in their best, during that interview process and selection process. Because if you went back a while, the point of the selection process would at times be quite an aggressive culling of the group of people to try and get to kind of last person standing. This seems like it's genuinely trying to help people turn up and show their best on the day.\nAG: Yeah. Does it create another, you have to think, does it create a problem down the line? That's the kind of sort of way I look at this kind of thing. So yes, I'm assuming that they've, they've done it to widen the field and make it fairer.\nMS: Yeah.\nAG: Yes.\nMS: Yeah.\nAG: So then does it create a problem down the line. You've got more people come into the funnel. everyone knows the questions. So, does that raise the bar for the pass rate, so to say? And I'm just speculating. You have to know what they're looking for. Do they need to hire a load of people? A load of people with particular skill sets. You have to be conscious of what unintended consequence could this create, further down the line in the next part of the recruitment process?\nAnd then that would be my sort of potential flag, but I'm obviously just speculating. I don't know what they're trying to do to achieve it. But when I saw 25 questions for the leadership.\nMS: Is that how many it is?\nAG: It was 25 questions. I was thinking, my God, I got to prepare for all of these. I've got to do this, got to do this. And I went straight into overthinking mode. So, where it benefits one, it'll always take - rob from Peter, give to Paul.\nDDS: I just want to touch on it because, I've chatted to quite a few, either CPOs or recruiters recently about this, and it keeps on coming up. ChatGPT or other generative AI systems are available, being used for either interview preparation or for live response during interview, where it's being done over video or certainly for cover letters.\nMS: Oh wow.\nDDS: Do we think that we're evolving our recruitment processes rapidly enough? I guess is the question for me.\nAG: I can pin that onto what we just said, that's the unintended consequences. And I think it's called Goodhart's law. It's like when, when a measure ceases to become a target, ceases to become a good measure. It's like, are we then encouraging people to utilize ChatGPT, or other AI tools. I thought, that's why I just chuck all these questions in and see what it spits out. So you're creating another problem further down the line? I just think it's, yes.\nMS: But I mean, it's not any different. I mean, you know, there's the technology so you get it quicker, but you could have asked people before, couldn't you or, you know, like the cover letter, you could have asked a friend to check it or to write it for you.\nAG: Yeah.\nMS: So now they just put it in a machine. I mean, at the end of the day, you're trying to get to the authentic self of the individual. At some point, I always like to think that, if you're not, I always say to people, well, look, you can do what you want. But at the end of the day, if you can't do what you're employed to do, then it will find you out at some point, right?\nAG: Yeah. If the nature of the job is, is that - I'm sure I heard Malcolm Gladwell talking about this, about the tortoise and the hare. His idea of the legal system, the stake favours the hares. So the people are very, very quick at stuff, get through the system. And actually, would the legal system, be better if there are more tortoises who need to slowly process it. But, for me, if the world of work is getting quicker, quicker, quicker, faster, there's, you sort of go, actually, I know we're speculating around it, it comes back to what are they trying to achieve? That would be my, what are you trying to achieve? Is this the right way of doing that? Or, is it going to create another problem and deviate you from the business?\nDDS: Yeah, I have no idea of the plural of tortoises. Tortai? But I'd kind of love it to be. There's a bit of me that deeply hopes that if you get many tortoises together, you call them 'tortai'.\nMS: Okay.\nDDS: That's not strictly relevant for this podcast.\nMS: Thanks, David.\nDDS: It matters to me in a like, very, very deep way. So, I'm going to, we're going to stick with, because it's been a couple of weeks for them, we're going to stick with that kind of focus on technology and recruitment. So, HMRC have enabled some of their roles to have a selection system that doesn't involve a human being in the loop. So essentially you, you go on, you do a series of tasks, a video piece that's then assessed. And you can, if you're successful and accept a role, through pressing yes. That's a thing that I'd like to do. I think there's a couple of really interesting things with this. One is in both of the cases that we've spoken about, you made the point around context. I think you both kind of made it around what we solve.\nUnless we know what's happening within those organisations, it's really difficult to judge. And I think it's always interesting I think when you see a headline come out and there are people strongly for and strongly against, and in fact you kind of go, look, do you actually know what that organisation is solving for the challenges it has? But secondly, I wanted to open up a broader conversation about where the profession's going in 4 or 5 years' time, but also flicking back a little bit to that really painful time during the pandemic, but where we know there was a lot of praise for the profession around its contribution. Now, there was some exceptional work done in that time, but I also think it brought to light a bit of focus on some of the great work the profession's always done and the contribution that it makes. But I was just wondering, like, be really good to have a rounded conversation about in five years' time, what the profession needs to have done to get itself into the right space with this raft of technology coming through.\nMS: I mean, for me, I think it's around, you can't predict, right, in five years' time. I mean, look at where we've been over the last, you know, few years. None of us have been able to, to predict it. So therefore, I go on the basis of you've got to be ready for whatever might come your way.\nDDS: Yeah.\nMS: So for me, it's about the profession being prepared. And I think the only way you can prepare is you have to invest time in yourself. So, I don't know where the, I mean the HR did amazing work during Covid, but was it just they do amazing work and it was just more recognized during that time because people suddenly had, well, leadership had people at the heart of it. Look people talk about that all the time. But the reality is we know when push comes to shove, maybe the people agenda kind of gets tweaked a little bit and they start focusing on, you know, financials and other stuff that, that come into play. So, I think for me, I would, the props go for at last they were recognised, or we were all recognised for, for what we've been doing for a long time. It just happened to be within a climate that other people really respected, I think, and, and had time to maybe step back and appreciate. And I think, you know, in terms of the change in the future, I'd really like to see, HR practitioners, you know, investing in, in time in themselves. And I know it's always going to be busy. They're always going to be oversubscribed for work. But I think the only way you can really take, you know, with new technology come in and new stuff, I mean, we're in a privileged position. Al and I, I guess in many ways, because of what, how we work that, you know, we have to keep on top of things all the time to be current, to be relatable, to be able to source new, new work.\nAnd I think, that, that will become the same, I think really within the profession. How will you know what's coming? How will you be able to think about what you're doing today and how it might impact my, got to put your own oxygen mask on first before you can help others, and it isn't going to be okay to be too busy or to do it. You're going to have to. Al I think our, you were saying before, you got to prioritise yourself within it and then you are useful to your business, to others, and also to yourself. That sounds like a bit of a sales pitch there for CIPD kind of development and that.\nDDS: Oh don't worry I'll take that. We haven't organised it but I'll take that.\nMS:  But as you know only too well that's kind of really you know, that is passionately, that's what I do believe in.\nAG: Yeah, I 100% agree I think the bit I was thinking, when you were just saying that is about you've just got to be, we've just got to be ridiculously useful. We're obviously useful during the pandemic. People know, oh, how do you do this? How do this? We've got to carry on doing that. We can't ride that way for being useful in the pandemic. Then help with some sort of, hybrid workplace, all that sort of stuff. We've got to be ridiculously useful and point that at the business goal.\nMS: But do you think that, sorry to interrupt you, but that bit being useful, do you think that's because people could see? Because I would say, I think HR people are being useful all the time, but it was just maybe, it was just taken more, people understood it and wanted it more. Whereas now when they go back to all the other pressures that are going on in the workplace.\nAG: There's a, there's a bit of that, isn't there. That's the, that's the branding piece. That's the perception piece with we're not the best as a profession, as a presenting and influencing and doing that sort of, that sort of work and sort of influencing that perception of us, rather than just 'we're doing great work, are people are going to notice it?' No, they're not, because they're as busy as you are. But I think with the, with the pandemic, one thing I really learned is like, we've just got to be useful. Think about what the business needs, figure out which bit of your work delivers that the most. Don't try and do all of it. You've got to leave some value on the floor.\nMS: Yeah.\nAG: Useful, useful, useful. And then tell people you've been useful. Tell people what you've done, tell them of how you've helped them build that sort of impact and influence. And then the, you were saying about the AI, I think that's the, that's the opportunity, how we look at stuff coming at us. I'm old enough to have seen, sort of, go from files to emails to laptops to phones and all this sort of stuff. If we've got to be, I know I have got to be, ahead of the curve to go, look, we've got this AI coming at us at 100 miles an hour. How is this an opportunity so we can be more useful? And I just see this is an opportunity to get rid of some of the, yes, slightly less useful stuff. Some of the clutter, some of the stuff that is getting in the way of us delivering the best work, the opportunity we had. So I think looking at AI and looking at technology, looking at it through the lens of being useful or productive and how can we utilise this before somebody else thinks how to do it better.\nDDS: It's kind of, it's kind of an enabler, isn't it, for it. So to kind of bring those two things together as two sides of the coin, you're only going to be able to add that, what you say ridiculously useful?\nAG: Ridiculous, or relentlessly, or sort of like, yeah.\nDDS: You seem really confident. Like that was the thing you always said, but.\nAG: It began with an 'R'.\nDDS: So let's go ridiculously useful. If you want to be ridiculously useful, then you have to understand the environment that you're operating in. You have to be well equipped for it.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: In which case, the only way you're going to get to be ridiculously useful, to your point, Mel, is to make sure that you continue to move with the times, develop your own skills.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: Invest in yourself. So technology can help solve that problem. But just freeing up a little bit of extra capacity that we don't go, that's a saving, we go, that's an investment that we then going to make in future capable.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: That has to be part of the narrative.\nMS: I think the AI thing, it's not just about what it does for us in our own profession. Right. It's about what it's doing in the wider business. And so, too often I kind of have been to these sessions and it's all about AI in HR. And I'm like, okay, yeah, that's one part of it. But as change agents too we need to be thinking and advising the business. Look, you've just put that bit of AI in your sales team and that, what's the impact of that? How do you know that it's giving you, you know, reliable information? What's the ethical stance on that as well? So, I think that's always a difficulty. We've got to kind of be looking at what it means for us as a profession, but, but also be the ambassadors or the governors or, not the police because we don't want to be in that, that place. And so, if we understand it, if we are able to role model it, if we're able to understand and say, look, this isn't about a cost saving. Yes. This piece of work is being, you know, AI can do that way better than we can. That doesn't mean to say I'm getting rid of three people. That means those three people can go on and do stuff they probably should have been doing anyway.\nAG: Yeah.\nDDS: Yeah, we've got, we've got a range of materials on the website I think I am allowed to plug the CIPD, I think that's the way it works.\nMS: Yeah, you go for it.\nDDS: It would be very limiting if I couldn't. But you know, we, we absolutely recognise within that that there are three things that we need to solve for. We need to solve for those principles of implementation and usage.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: So to your point, when you, when you're solving for it, it's not just putting a tech solution in. It's what's the impact that has on people, their jobs, the accessibility to jobs and quality of them. Secondly, there's a change management piece. And you're right, that's across the organisation and I think it's really interesting. I was chatting to someone the other day about the need for industrial relations skills. You know, there was obviously a time that was of a primacy in the profession. Then it probably became less current for a while. And then current environment, we've had a really challenging few, many, many years in a number of sectors where suddenly that's the skill set people are really, you know, caring about and investing in. Change management seems like that's going to be an [inaudible]. Change management. OD. The cultural understanding, that collaboration piece across organizations feels like that's going to be of massive value over the next few years. And then the final one to up to your point, and actually it links to stuff we've been saying. Is the profession being comfortable using the tools and understanding tools and not seeing it as a threat. So I'm still chatting to people who are essentially scared of it.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: And it's like, well, we don't really get to opt out of this because this is a, you know, potentially society-changing shift. We've got to understand it. We don't need to learn how to code. We don't need to know the ins and outs of the nuances that sit within it. You don't need to be able to map the whole market. But you need to understand what it can do and how it might impact.\nMS: Yeah, I mean, I would go and I'd be a bit more pushy, but I know, why not, I would always be but.\nDDS: That's so rare for you.\nMS: David I knew you were going to say that.\nDDS: I'm going to take it, and I'm going to push it.\nMS: That's what he does Al, he's just like. But they need to be on the forefront of those, those things. It's like I don't know how you can help others if you, if you're not comfortable with it yourself.\nDDS: Yeah. You wouldn't hire someone in IT, who went I was really good up to Windows 95 and then I just kind of opted out. You've got to stay in that space. So if we are, look if we're going to try and help support organisations to be the very best for their people and, and for their performance, and their contribution and impact, the only way you can do that is to choose from whole of market and go, look, all of these things are available to me. What's the best combination and tech's part of that mix, right?\nAG: Yeah, I just, I think there's a critical point there, isn't there. I was thinking, we've got to look at AI not from an HR lens, but from a business lens.\nMS: 100%.\nAG: And go that was one of the big bits. If we're just listening to the leadership team talk about AI and how it helps their departments, we've got to think about it from a business perspective first. If we want to be considered business people and then we bring the lens of HR, the human lens, this is the impact. In the same way a CEO would ask the FD, what's the cost of it? The tech CTO? What's the, what's the impact of this? How long is this going to take? I think that as soon as we start seeing it from a business lens and understanding it, and that requires us as individuals to understand business better, rather than just our silo of business. I know I've gone on a hell of a journey over the last decade to try and understand the business and understand how it works. We're one of the only professions...\nMS: Have you got the answer, though. That's what we all want to know. Now, to understand business.\nAG:  I haven't got the answer, but that's how you can influence people, in other departments, if you understand that's the empathy where they're coming from, their problem. If you understand how AI could potentially impact business, then you may have the permission to go, 'this is how we're going to use this in HR. And this is the benefit'. So, you're getting one step ahead of the curve, one step ahead of the problem, one step ahead of the other people in the leadership team or other departments. Which to do that requires stepping back a little bit, putting our oxygen mask on, saying no to some of the work that's keeping us relentlessly busy.\nDDS: Yeah, and it's that alignment piece, isn't it? So years ago, I was at a conference and I remember chatting to someone and they, they said they couldn't get any traction with their board, over wellbeing. So, they just weren't able to get the board interested. So I said, well, what is it that is on the board's mind that's taking up their time? And they said, we're worried about people getting burnout. And it was literally just needed to step back just a tiny bit and go, no the business problem that you're trying to solve is actually almost entirely congruent to the thing that you're trying to put in then.\nAnd I think, you know, you're right. Tech, tech, I think, is special in some ways because it's driving a lot of change, but in others it's just another component part that we need to deal with within that.\nMS: But we also know, you know, I talk to people a lot about, they've put tech in and they say it's not working, but it's nothing to do with the tech. It's the adoption of it. So, you know, tech is some technology. But really what we're talking about is about people.\nDDS: And change.\nMS: And change. And that's what we're about. Right. So, you know, with AI isn't about the tech that's, that's an enabler. But actually, it's about what we're going to do with it. How are we going to make it work for us? It's all about the people question. Right. And that is our bread and butter. That is what we're good at. And that's what we've got to ensure that in, you know, now and in the future that we're, we've kind of focused on in helping the business. Yes, I get it. All the other stuff has to happen when I say the other stuff, you know, the stuff that makes, you know, hiring and, and such like, but, you know, it's still very much progression of a business is still very much a big key role of us to play, for the profession to play, as well as, the chief strategy manager, if you've got one of them or whatever they call themselves, like, these days,\nAG: I think it's a phenomenal opportunity for us, in HR, now to lean into this technology and go, oh how can it actually help us do what we really want to do? Do all the stuff we've been talking about for ages. It's going to give us permission, but we've got to make sure we're not automating something we don't need to do.\nMS: Yeah, and make sure the ethical side of things. Right. Because, you know, I, as David knows only too well, I'm not a big like, policy kind of thing. I kind of, when he invites me to things sometimes I'm if I'm like [snore], I'm like if it's not kind of like enough.\nDDS: Live feedback [inaudible]\nMS: Feedback in the moment. But, you know, I do think that ethical piece is, you know, a really big thing when we're talking about what's the right thing for it to do, you know, what is it having access to? And people get very excited about new things, but sometimes they don't always think about that total impact on it. And maybe we are the only ones thinking about it. And in this time, it really is where I know the act has come out. The European directive, now. But, you know, it, it is something that we're running it in real time. So, we have an onus on us to, to catch it and hopefully to, to move it forward. That doesn't mean to say that's what we over focus on and we just become like in the ethical space. We also need to balance that with the change piece too, which becomes more you know, we're trying to say, well, we've got to do it all haven't we.\nDDS: Yeah look, well you know, as the professional body we ask people to be three things. So principles led us.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: You're absolutely right. It's that framework that you have, you know, evidence based and, and that's not falling for some of the hype that's going to be coming over the next few years.\nMS: Yeah.\nDDS: But thinking really clearly about what's possible and what evidence we've got and then outcomes driven, which links to, I think, the whole conversation, which is what are you genuinely trying to solve for and is this the best way of doing it? But I thought I'd just leave people with a story to reassure them that there's a little gap that we've got to operate in, to upskill, to get on the front foot, because it's not quite there yet. So, a couple of weeks ago, I was, playing about with one of the natural language models, and, I asked the bot to draw me a graph, which it did perfectly. Absolutely amazing. Like it went out into the internet, got the information, drew a graph. I then said can you change the axis on the graph? And it flatly denied that it could draw graphs or that it had drawn the graph. Right. So, like, because they are sometime quite human-like, I ended up in an argument with a chat bot.\nAnd I'm going, but I can see it and it's going you must be mistaken. I'm going, literally, it's two things above. And I ended up feeling, I think the words are overused, but I end up feeling genuinely gaslit because it, and it started going, well, what you call a graph might not be what I consider to be a graph. I was like maybe it's just semantics.\nMS: No but in real terms. If you're someone, we've all been on the on the end of those kind of conversations, right, where you want some help and how many times do we say, oh, I just need to speak to someone about this. And I always take it back to that, to people when they say, oh, well, AI is going to take over the world type thing, and it's like, look, let's hope it takes over the stuff which is really easy to do and can make people's lives so much easier in any walk of life, not just in, in the profession, but there's also hope that that gives us the capacity then of when people really need to have the human interaction where there's nothing better than a human interaction. Let's be honest about that. That it's there, there's the capacity and there's that human element we can bring. Because at the end of the day, if we lose that, that's that.\nDDS: Yeah, it's complex, nuanced, really important work. And that's going to be hellishly hard to automate. And you could probably make a good argument that you wouldn't want to do that anyway. And I think being in a profession that operates in that space, it's about absolutely how we make sure that, you know, we talked about five years forward. It's about how we actually make sure that that stays at and becomes ever increasingly at the heart of the work.\nSo, nothing else to do. So thank you so much to both of you, for coming in today, Mel, for looking so, healthy.\nMS: You're welcome.\nDDS: Al for making me feel that actually, I'm not the odd one out. thank you so much. Look forward to having you back again. But, to everyone else, the only other thing I'll say is, as many people know, because it's been difficult to avoid it. We've had, an election called, in the UK. So, the CIPD has been engaging with parties, across the spectrum with our calls for policies around the world of work. So we're looking forward to seeing the manifestos that will be appearing. If you want to see our work so far, please check out our calls for action page on the CIPD website.\nBut excitingly, I can say that the very day after the election results, as the last results are trickling in. We'll be having a dedicated election special of this podcast where we'll be getting luminaries, and experts to come in and talk about the implications of whatever the result is for the world of work and for the profession in particular.\nTo close, the final thing I'd like to say is that, you've been listening to the CIPD's new podcast. We hope you'll keep listening to it. You'll find it in the same place on a regular basis. But I'd like to thank Mel and Al for their contributions today in giving up their time. Really appreciate it. Thank you\nMS: Thank you.\nAG: Thank you.\nIn our second pilot episode, host David D'Souza, the CIPD's Director of Profession, recruits Mel Steel, former HR director and interim people & transformation leader, and Alistair Gill, Chief Alchemist at Alchemy Labs, to the panel as we respond to some of the key stories from the past fortnight, including the decision from John Lewis to share interview questions in advance with potential candidates and the use of AI in the recruitment process.\nRecorded: 24 May 2024\nHR People Pod - Pilot Episode 1\nDuration: 31:10\nTranscript\nDavid D'Souza: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. wherever and whenever you're listening to this. Welcome to the CIPD's new fortnightly programme, available on iTunes, Spotify, limited edition vinyl, wherever you get your podcasts, but you don't need to worry about that because seemingly, you've already found us. We'll be bringing you the top stories from the world of work that are impacting the profession and the organisations you work in or support.\nI'm David D'Souza. I work at the CIPD and joining me today are three of the finest brains from the profession. Woosh, who is Exec. Director of People, Culture and Inclusion at NCVO, which is one of the longest job titles that I've come across. Katie, who is CPO at OneAdvanced and Bertie, who is CPO at Collinson. We'll be doing a couple of things today. We'll be running through some recent news that's caught the eye of our expert guests and then we'll be doing a deep dive on, actually some of the changing impacts on the profession and the changing demands on the profession and what that means for the future of it and a little bit, actually, about what it means for you as practitioners and how it feels to do the job. So, without further ado, I'd like to come to Woosh. What's been capturing your eye over the last couple of weeks?\nWoosh Raza: Hi everyone. So, I, this headline kind of grabbed my attention. \"Gen Z aren't lazy, they just know that work doesn't pay\". So, there's a body, of kind, of interesting research, and that's hit the news around Gen Z being lazy or, sorry, not being lazy, just being clear on, like, work and life and just kind of, you know, seeing work in a more transactional way. And that's been, I think, kind of some evidence that CIPD have also kind of shed some light on around transactional attitudes towards work, specifically for those under 35. So, yeah, I thought this was interesting. I think inter-generational challenges for any HR professional right now who, like, who copes with having to deal with an inter-generational workforce. I'm sure we all see it in our kind of day-to-day.\nYou've got so many different attitudes in the workplace because you've got four or five different generations that are kind of all, you know, working at the same time. I find it it's interesting because I don't see Gen Zs in that kind of way. From my kind of view, from my point of view. Well, I don't have a point of view. I think every person is different. We see a lot of that individuality coming through Gen Zs, a lot more kind of purpose that they know what they want. They're very clear, the social purpose piece is really strong. But at the same time, I kind of can see this in, in terms of like, where does work stop and life begin and actually just being clear on the boundaries. Which is really interesting after the pandemic, you know, when everything just got mushed into like one big ball of life. So, yeah, I'm not sure what we, what we think, what others think around that around the Gen Zs not being lazy?\nBertie Tonks: I had a personal experience, probably within the last year, where I walked into my son's bedroom about 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock in the afternoon and he was in bed and I was like, \"get up, come on. It's about time you get a job\". He's 17 years old. I want him to start earning his way. He said, \"why would I bother to get a job?\" He said, \"do you realise that this morning I've earned PS250 just by buying and selling trainers without lifting a single finger?\" And there you have it. He was like, \"only a fool would go to work\". And like, I literally couldn't argue with him.\nWR: Did you shut the door? Did you go, \"all right, have a good day?\"\nBT: Yeah, it's just, but you know what? He really wasn't wrong. And I think, I do think that Gen Zs, there is a sometimes a negative connotation that's talked about, like they feel like they're gifted, and they should have everything they want and it's just a different expectation and we do need to appreciate that they see things automated. They, you know, they're digital natives. So, everything is, it should be easier. There's an, should be an easier way to achieve any result and we don't really, we don't really embrace that in the world of work when actually it's a very thing that we're looking to drive.\nWR: Yeah. Katie. Because I know you've got some view on purpose, right? And like purpose being clear with this generation. Like what, because. I think there's also resentment. Like, I think that's also coming because I hear. We got told the Millennials were lazy, like, you know on the news like five/ten years ago. It's like every new generation's lazy and I think it's just, there's something about resentment in the workplace. Well, I wasn't allowed to do what you do, which is work from home. I had to go into the office all the time and stuff, but I don't know. What do you think? Like, do you think there's more purpose do you think they're clear in that purpose?\nKatie Obi: Yeah, I, firstly every time I read or listen to anything that it talks about generation, and it stereotypes everyone in a generation, I'm, my heart sinks as well. So, I know people are more individuals, so I don't think one rule applies to everyone. And as, as you rightly said, Woosh, you know every generation that's come through, we've had similar debates. I think one of the things that is different though is society has changed and it has changed quite significantly. So, if we look at people who are coming into the workplace now, often they would have completed schooling or university in the COVID era where actually things weren't, they didn't have the same kind of experiences as the rest of us did; finishing school or going to university if that was our choice.\nThe world is different in terms of whether there's in-person relationships, the flexibility that you can now have in your work. The flexibility of options that are available as well. You know, the entrepreneurial options as you talked about in, in terms of your son. There are just different ways to be able to get to the end result and people have more choice around what they choose to, want to spend their time on, which links into the purpose statement too, which is people, if people have choices of how they can achieve the same end result, they're going to choose something that is meaningful for them, whether that's the mission that they're associated with building up, whether it's flexibility, whether it's the ability to earn money while you sleep, you know those are all different things that are available to people and the transaction is different in terms of reward for, for performance and results and working in a traditional environment because student loans are, you know, people have accumulated a lot of debt. It's really difficult to be able to secure housing. It's different for this generation than it was for a couple of generations ago. So, people are having to rethink how they get to the outcomes and the lifestyles that they want and what's important. So, it all ties together from that standpoint.\nBT: Yeah, yeah.\nDDS: And then the answer might be trainers, apparently.\nKO: Might be trainers, from bed.\nDDS: So, we need to be open to that. Bertie.\nBT: Yeah, and you know, I think, I think what they're really looking for, from the conversations that I'm having is the opportunity to do meaningful work. You talk about purpose, Woosh, absolutely spot on, but you know purpose isn't just about charitable organisations and doing good to the planet.\nWR: Yeah, yeah.\nBT: It's about feeling like you're actually making a difference, gaining the opportunity to play to my strengths, so actually I feel like I'm on fire when I'm working and work isn't just work, it can be fun, and I can enjoy what I do as well. But in order for them to do that, you need the leadership above that also exhibit similar behaviours and to acknowledge that that's actually not just OK, it's going to help our businesses thrive.\nDDS: Katie, what's caught your eye?\nKO: Yeah. So, there was a news article which was about, really about the rise in the UK minimum wage, but also the unintended consequences because I think a lot of us really think about that and think, \"well, that's great\". You know, it's important that we're keeping, we're keeping minimum wage increasing because costs have materially increased for people. But then there's always another side to anything that happens, and the unintended consequences and this news story was around employers who were cutting hours and hiring less to offset the cost increase associated with minimum wage increases. And I thought that was really interesting to think through in terms of, there are unintended, really negative consequences for individuals as a result of those increases. And it got me thinking a little bit in terms of; there are tough economic times for both people who are working and also for employers and there's a balance here that has to be struck and how a company is really thinking about navigating through this and how are we, as HR professionals really thinking about how we navigate and how we find the right balance. We do play that role that's in between the two. We want to make good workplaces, and we want to be able to ensure that people can afford to be able to meet their needs. At the same time, we also have to make sure that the organisation is able to be scalable and sustainable.\nSo, I started thinking also with the discussions that are happening around automation and AI and productivity. How do we create these workplaces that are beneficial for people, beneficial for society, bring in opportunities for productivity to be able to help enhance the way people do their jobs in a way that is sustainable for organisations so we can continue to strike that balance? Because it shouldn't have to be a one choice or another, which is what this article really implied, you know, was happening. We need to find ways to be able to navigate through that successfully, going forward.\nDDS: Yeah. And there's a range of things going on there, from industrial skills strategy. So, how we help rebalance economies at large right through to that kind of, you know, notion of what jobs are going to be created and how do people flex into that. I think one of the weirdest things I heard from an organisation a few years ago. So, they were reducing the number of jobs, but for the people that remained, there would be better quality jobs. I'm in favour of better-quality jobs for the people that remained, but equally it's not going to help anyone pay their mortgage or rent if they're not in that group. So, it's a real challenge I think in that. Bertie?\nBT: Yeah, I, I mean we do. We've got to continue helping people, helping our people grow, learn and build successful careers in whatever path that might go. There's a long way to go, I think in our organisations, even though the learning is all there, the research is all there to tell us what we need to do. But if we're going to get this right, we have to create different pathways for people and enable them to be able to tap into that.\nDDS: Yeah, absolutely, Woosh?\nWR: Do you know what we need to do? We need to let go of the notion; HR need to let go of the notion. We need to stop educating. We stop talking to our CEOs and stakeholders, of the notion that talent is going to be retained at the, like for a long time. So, I think we need to stop measuring, and I know this is really bold, retention because that links to your cost of living. Like, people are going to leave quicker because the world's a more difficult place. If you're going to get more money somewhere else, they're going to go and it's OK for that to happen, for people to support their families and their houses and their and have food on the table. And actually, for us, we have to get our organisation to be more agile in thinking about what talent looks like and how we can bring talent in and stop letting go of this, \"the longer you stay somewhere\" and all of that stuff. Yes, that comes with its benefits as well. But we're in a different market right now and I think we have.\nDDS: Yeah.\nWR: To kind of get on the front foot for this.\nDDS: Completely. Bertie. Well, the story that caught your eye as you had probably quite a strong link to retention of talent and how it's looked after in the different ways organisations are looking at that.\nBT: Yeah, absolutely. The headline for me was: \"No more return to office\". So, \"London firms let more staff work from home full-time\", by Bloomberg. Clearly a really well-worn path I think, this conversation amongst HR circles, but for me it's not going to go away anytime soon. At Collinson, my company, we're doing lots of really good stuff around this I think, but lots of lessons still to be learnt. Companies have a very clear reason why they want people in to work, but I think we also need to think about how we can give people a reason to come in as well and that this is a two-way exchange, again that more rewarding valuable work is part of it, making sure that our organisations remain much more social is also important. You know, the human-centred organisation is more prevalent today than it ever has been, and yet it almost feels like it's out of reach. Now we talk about hybrid, people communicating online through Zoom or Teams or what have you, that hasn't got rid of the social element of our organisations. But when they, when people do come in, the biggest problem for me isn't our workforce, whether or not they're coming in. It's that when they're in, our leadership and what I describe as a leadership deficit is a huge challenge because our leaders aren't equipped with the skills, techniques or even capabilities to be able to encourage people to want to come in in the first place. Personal view.\nWR: Yeah, I think. I'm so glad you said \"leadership deficit\" here and I know we've all spoke about it. It's like about kind of what we do in an HR to equip leaders. Because it's not a good, easy message to go to your, like, senior leaders like, yeah, \"you ain't got the skills to navigate this\". What you're saying? Right. But you did it really well there, like you did it. Really.\nDDS: I mean, there's a whole stakeholder management thing that we could do here. I wouldn't lead with it, but yeah.\nBT: Yeah, but interesting. Interestingly, I do that in my own organisation, because we talk about this, we're quite forthright and what was interesting is when we do, everyone says, \"yeah, I know what you mean. We, they do have a problem.\" And so, no-one. Everyone sides themselves away from the problem.\nDDS: Yeah. And people management capability was a challenge pre-pandemic. So, you know, strong links to productivity. We knew that it was a challenge then. It's harder now than it's been. You've also got what's a really interesting shift, which is a lot of attention on hybrid working and the shifts there. But we know it doesn't impact the entire economy and that leadership capability and managerial capability being uplifted would benefit us right across the piece. But we can't have those conversations unless we're going to be, to your point, open and challenging and open with ourselves as well about what needs to change. Katie, you got any thoughts before we go on to the meaty topic of the day?\nKO: Yeah, I do, actually. So, I very much feel that leadership is a duty and it's a duty that we all, that we all carry and it's. I think a lot of people think that leadership is a privilege, it's not. It's a responsibility and it's not one to wear lightly. And if you're not ready to take on that responsibility, you shouldn't be a leader and we need to make sure that there are lots of paths available to people who don't want to go down that route, where they can still progress their careers and we don't become accidental managers or leaders that aren't equipped to be able to do it. It's a really important role in an organisation, as is the role of a manager too, and I think not equipping people and putting the wrong people in those roles because it's the only opportunity for progression, that's what leads to this management deficit. But if you are a leader, it's really important to be able to step up in that you have to be out, you have to be talking to people, you have to be listening to what's going on in your organisation and you have to say \"thank you\". I mean the power of someone who is senior coming up to you and recognising and being specific about what you've done, what they've noticed and have a thank you for it that goes such a long way and if we're not doing that, then we're not in the right role. So, I really think that we need to make sure that everybody understands the role of a leader, how important it is and that it's just non-negotiable to be able to do those things.\nDDS: Yeah, I said \"thank you\" to someone a few years ago, and I know that one time I did it, I know I had a massive impact. Bertie, some final thoughts on that?\nBT: Yeah, it's just to sneak this one in very quickly. I think one of the big chasms that I still see is the is the gap really between the academic world and practitioners and actually consultants as well. Let's bring that, just triangulate that a little bit. There's so much research out there, whether that's coming from neuroscience or some of the business schools etc. We need to be bringing that in, particularly in relation to behavioural science and the link between behaviours and reward and because you know, it works for animals, works for dogs, works for people. Honestly, this stuff's still. You know, we're still apes without hair. It. There is so much to learn. I think if we can, if we can tap into this, it will really help our leaders understand what is it that they really need to do to make the difference.\nDDS: At the CIPD, we ask for practitioners to be three things. We ask a lot of practitioners, actually, and that's what we're going to be talking about now. But we talk about being evidence-based and that talks to your point around needing to draw from those different sources of evidence and make connections there. We talk about being principles-led, so actually you can't just make any decision, there's a kind of code of conduct and ethics that sits behind this. But we also talk about being outcomes-driven. All of those three things, I think, are more demanding now than they were five to ten years ago. And that's not to say the job was easy five to ten years ago, several of the people sitting around here would have been doing it. But the world is moving on at a rapid pace. But equally, I think the diversity of things we're being asked to do is ever more challenging. That places more pressure on practitioners, both in terms of expectation and that expectation can come from others or that can come from yourself. And we know that it causes challenges around burnout and feelings around confidence for the profession at large. I want to have a really honest conversation about actually how it feels, what's shaping up, what we need to do differently? Katie, if I come to you first, is all that right?\nKO: Yeah, definitely. The breadth of what we're asked to cover, as people leaders, is huge, maybe more so than almost any other function in the organisation. So, I think in some ways, just even acknowledging that we can't be experts in all of those areas is a great first step. What we have to be able to do is govern and manage and navigate through it and make sure the right things happen, and we have the right people around us. But there is often an expectation that we should be experts in every single area, and we should know all of the answers to things. And increasingly, work is getting more and more complex. And we don't need to know the answers to everything. What we need to do is be able to navigate through them and we don't navigate through things on our own. We have to navigate in partnership.\nOne of the things that I always find really important is that we, as professionals, should be business leaders who have an expertise in people and in talent. We are, we have a responsibility around ensuring that we're doing all the right things to support the organisation to be able to achieve a strategy. Talent is a really massive part in being able to do that, but we can only do that effectively if we understand, commercially, what the organisation is doing, what the rest of our counterparts on the C-Suite [phonetic] are trying to achieve and we can help figure out the right way to be able to do that collectively, in partnership with the CFO, in partnership with the other leaders to make sure that we are getting to that right end result. And I think the expectations about being a lot more commercial, understanding the business strategy as much as we do the people strategy, that's an emerging.\nI know we've been talking about a seat at the table for years, but it's an emerging requirement in that it's not a \"nice to have\", we shouldn't be people leaders first who understand a bit of the commercial, we are business leaders who understand people and use that to be able to help the organisation be more effective and build a great environment for people and that is a fundamental shift, to me and it moves us away from that requirement to, the older way of doing things, where we're more of a compliance function or an administrative function. We shouldn't be that. Yes, we have to make sure we're compliant. Yes, we have to make sure people don't do things that are illegal. Yes, we have to make sure that the administrative pieces are done. And yes, we have to make sure that we're advocating for employees needs and rights. But we have to do so with a commercial lens.\nWR: So, can I just, you know, that \"seat at the table\" thing, right? Oh my God.\nKO: I know.\nWR: Literally, I'm so over it.\nDDS: I'm glad you 've said that.\nWR: We have got a seat at the bloody. Like, I am bored of this. It's like we need to use that seat at the table to do things that only we can do.\nKO: Yes.\nWR: Like having a seat at the table is, and you're so right, it's a shift, right it's not just about, I don't know, \"we want to make all these massive issues and redundancies whatever\". All \"Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. Three bags full\". The current. It's in the profession map, I think, \"courage to challenge\", isn't it? And \"courage to challenge\" is like key. But I don't think we do enough of that in our profession. I think we need to be braver and bolder when we have that seat at that table, we've got the seat at the table. Do you know what I mean? Like we've got this seat at the table, we just need to actually do something like to champion the people who work in our organisations, and I think that we are still finding our feet in the profession around this. Like I don't think it's consistent.\nDDS: Katie, I'm just, there was something that you said that I thought was really interesting, was around working in partnership. And you talked about all of those partnerships kind of internally and you've talked about doing things together. And I actually think there's a real challenge for the profession to come together, if only because some of these jobs are some of the most emotionally demanding, isolated and lonely jobs that anyone can do in an organisation. Bertie, I know, you know, we were all chatting beforehand, but you know, we talked about the level of issue that people can have to deal with, how emotionally draining that can be. Don't know if we, I think it'd be a really good place to take the conversation actually, to kind of bring it into not just the changing impacts of HR and the shape of the job, but actually the changing demands on people doing the thing, yeah?\nBT: On us, right. You know, us three in this room are all practitioners and we feel it. And for people coming through their career, no matter what level you are in your organisation in HR. I've got a little bit of bad news is things aren't going to get any better. I don't want to paint dark cloud actually\nWR: No, but it's true.\nBT: Because this is the opportunity for us. But we have to recognise that all roads in businesses come back to talent and cash. Those two things ultimately. And when it comes to talent, the Board sit. I sit on a Board and people in this room do. The Board will look around and say, \"how can you solve these challenges for us?\" And I think your point around, Woosh, around being bold is really important. I can't tell you the number of times where I've had to almost be prepared to put my job on the line because it's something that I believe in. Now that's scary. I've got, I've got commitments, security, family, all that kind of stuff that I have to protect. But it's one of those things that in a, unusually across all professions, that's one that we have to be able to stand behind that integrity. And I find that, there's the saying, \"It's always lonely at the top.\" I tell you what, it actually really is. It is because you're there for your CEOs, we're there for our CFOs. If we share too much of the negative thoughts and feelings that we have, the challenges that we're experiencing with our team. It's almost like it's the end of the world, so they start to panic themselves. And yeah, \"if you're feeling like that. Oh my gosh\". So, we almost don't have anywhere to turn and increasingly I'm understanding the real power our profession holds, from the boardroom to the broom cupboard, of being able to be more vulnerable.\nWR: I love that.\nBT: In our conversations and relationships.\nWR: I love it. And you're so right. I mean, I, oh, my God. So much of what you've said just resonates with my, with where I'm at. OK. I'm sure you probably feel this as well. We hold so much and that's what I think we need to be talking in the profession more, and we're not talking about it and like, that's the thing that I feel like is such a game-changer. Even this conversation is cathartic because, like, you know, a problem shared is a problem halved. We know that we're not good at doing that, though in the profession because we think we have all the answers, or we need to have all the answers, and we don't. We don't have all the answers right now. And that's OK to say that. And if we say that our leaders will start to recognise that as well, but that takes courage and that's a difficult path to navigate.\nDDS: Yeah, and every everyone in this, everyone in this room, everyone part of this chat we're, you know, we're established in our careers at this point, but actually that loneliness can hit, and that challenge can hit at every part of your career. In fact, you know, in the early parts, you know, you've also got the uncertainty of, \"I've never faced this before\" happening on a far more frequent basis. But equally the impact of your actions, whether it's having to sit down in a room with someone who's suffered a bereavement, whether it's having to explain to someone that they're not going to get the promotion they want or even, you know, they're not going to continue to be employed. They're hugely emotionally draining topics.\nBT: They are and you know what? It's not worries me, but I actually feel I've done a lot of work around my personal purpose and that is; truly leaving a lasting impact on the changing world of work, and one that I'll hopefully one day when I'm dead, I'll be remembered for.\nWR: And the hats.\nBT: And the hats, yeah.\nDDS: For context, Bertie's wearing a hat. So, there aren't visuals on this and that would make no sense for anyone outside this room, but there are two things we're hoping, when he passes away, that he's remembered for; impacts in the world of work and the hats.\nBT: My hats, yeah. But I'm determined that, you know, we're in this position now, like we are in this room, we're discussing these challenges, we have to change this for people coming up through the profession, right? Because the world of work is just not going to get any better or any easier. So, part of that, I think, is making sure we start to push our leadership teams when they turn around to us and say, \"this is, what are you're doing about this in HR?\". It's not because they're trying to, I believe, trying to put everything on our doorstep. It's because they don't know how to cope.\nWR: And how to deal with it, yeah.\nBT: These are challenges that they don't know how to cope with either. And I think part of what we can do to change this situation and start to improve it is actually, is instead of pretending that we do know the answer is to turn it around and say, \"how are we going to deal with this? Because this is our challenge, collectively\".\nKO: I completely agree with that, and going back to the comment that you made in terms of these are lonely roles that I think this is. It's a lonely profession and we are here. We are the rock for everybody else. So, we're there to support everyone else and then there's nowhere else to go. Bertie, as you said, you can't talk to your team about some of the things that are, that you might be privy to. A lot of the things that we are working through with employees, we also can't talk about. They're deeply private things and very demanding topics that often we haven't been trained for as professionals as well. We're trying to play multiple different roles and there's a lot that we can't talk about. And then because we are so used to keeping the right things appropriately private, we then don't talk about things too, and sometimes I mean, I know something that has been really valuable for me is reaching out to peers in the profession as well. And obviously we don't share anything that's commercially sensitive or that's sensitive for an individual. But to be able to talk about similar themes of things that are coming up and realise that you're not alone, there are other people who are navigating through it and to hear different ideas of how people have managed to resolve certain items or where they're focusing can be so valuable. I've personally found it very, very valuable, when there isn't anyone else to talk to around those different elements.\nBT: I had, I had the most beautiful, Kate, the most beautiful moment, literally about two weeks ago, the head of our CRG, our LGBTQ+ community. I was walking into the lift, actually having a cracking day and he walked up to me. He said, \"you all right?\" I said, \"yeah\", he said and we, small talk. He said, \"you look like you've just been crying\". I mean, I absolutely hadn't. And he said, \"I was going to give you a hug then\" and I went, \"well, why don't you give me a hug anyway?\" And we had a hug, a random hug in the hall, and I can't tell you. It's really strange, right? It's just a hug and I was already having a good day, but I felt even better because someone asked me twice how I felt and they were really, really concerned and interested. My gosh, that was immense for me, even to, I'm talking about it today, but it's also a lesson for me in leadership.\nWR: I think. I love that we have this chat, and I love that you shared that example, Bertie, because I think, you know, men in particular need to be more vulnerable in the workplace and that was a great example of what you just shared. But I do think we are look, back to your point around what's coming on our, around our desk, we've got trauma coming into our spaces that we've never had to deal with before in the profession, right? So, I mean, yeah, that's really tough, bereavement is really, I mean that of course all of that is difficult, but I've had to deal with suicide. I've had to actually be on the phone to the police last year, to go to an employee's house to, because that employee expressed suicidal ideation, and you know. I come from a background, psychiatry, mental health so I was able to remember some bits and pieces from my back then, but counselling and mental health, I think it's so, there's so much of that coming through our kind of, you know, our desk and I think we, if we can't if we don't get it right with like connecting with each other now we have to start doing that.\nDDS: And I think that's, I think that's the point, isn't it? It's the difficulty of things coming across the desk, the intensity of that as well. It's then actually as a community, how do you form the bonds that you need for support, how do you make sure that you've actually got the right information that you need to act as confident as you can do? It's also, and I think conversations like this are really important. It's also being really open that everyone feels like that. Kind of one of the most enduring memories from the pandemic was chatting to a series of HR directors. All they needed to know was actually that other people were feeling the same way too. Because to that point around, you know, loneliness and isolation. It's really easy to feel, actually, because the expectations are so high, that it's impossible to meet them. Katie, I'm going to give you the final word and then we'll wrap up for today. I know like loads of pressure on there as well.\nKO: I wasn't expecting it to be the final word.\nDDS: So, I'm just. I'm just making the work environment even worse for you - live on a podcast.\nKO: I wasn't expecting it to be the final word. I was just going to add to that to say I think sometimes we feel a lot of guilt as well and that these issues aren't directly happening to us. They are very emotional and intense, but we feel guilty about having a reaction to that and saying that it's actually difficult for us because we're too busy wanting to make sure that person is safe or we're helping the families navigate through what they need to. So, I think that that guilt thing is a really important thing because we're quite good at compartmentalising in general, but letting people know it's OK to feel anything that they're feeling, that is OK. I think if you then add the, those different pressures that are coming through and those topics that we're dealing with, with also going back to the earlier comments around how the role is changing as well and that we have to also make sure that we understand commercially what we're doing and that we're having a role to play in that and we should have an opinion on different parts of the business and what's happening from a strategic standpoint. Those are a lot of things. We're asking people to, you know, navigate high, navigate low, be able to deal with lots of different, very intense topics all at once. And I think we as a profession need to understand how we can reach out and support each other more as we go through that.\nDDS: Absolutely, and you'll see more from us through the year that's focused directly on the profession. It's utterly something that we recognise, a greater focus from us will benefit the profession as a whole. We want it to feel like home. We want it to feel like the place that you go to connect to people that are discovering new ways to do things, as well as discovering different ways to cope or places that they might need support. I'd like to thank you all for the conversation today. I think it's an absolute critical one for us to have and for bringing such interesting news stories to us as well. Bertie, I hope you're with us for some while longer, actually, that sounds morbid, but as part of this conversation.\nBT: I will be. I thought you were my friends.\nDDS: Couple of reminders from me. One is that we'll be putting this out to you on a regular basis and I hope that you'll continue to enjoy the conversation. Secondly, as the CIPD, Bertie mentioned it earlier, it's really important that that evidence base is brought to light. If you go to www.cipd.org, you'll be able to find a range of things that we already do for you, and information on more stuff that will be coming soon, but otherwise thank you to our guests and we look forward to you listening again soon.\nBT: Thank you so much.\nWR: Thanks everyone.\nKO: Thank you.\nIn our first pilot episode, host David D'Souza, the CIPD's Director of Profession, welcomes Woosh Raza, Executive Director of People Culture and Inclusion at NCVO, Katie Obi, Chief People Officer at One Advanced and Bertie Tonks, Chief People Officer at Collinson to the panel as we discuss whether Gen Z are 'lazy', the unintended consequences of a rising minimum wage, whether more organisations are letting people work from home full-time and take a deeper dive into the growing demands on the profession.\nRecorded: 10 May 2024\nOur online Community\nA place to learn, debate and connect with other HR and L&D professionals\nConnect and learn\nWe offer a range of ways to stay connected,from events to networking, workshops and webinars.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:32:50\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy (NC): Got yawning skills gaps? Business needs changing faster than your people? It's time to upskill your workforce and here's ideas on how you can do it. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast. It's been estimated a staggering 9 out of 10 of us will have to reskill in some form by 2030. Not just to keep up with changing tech, but to stay in our jobs as work demands evolve. So, in this podcast we're going to consider what good upskilling looks like. And as things stand, half of all UK employers say they plan to upskill their people. That's according to the Summer 24 CIPD Labour Market Outlook, which only makes you wonder how the other half think they're going to manage. With us, a trio with a real handle on all this. Firstly, from the Government Property Agency and HR Director, currently running a pioneering and ongoing skills raising learning programme. One showing impressive results, it's won a CIPD People Management Award. It's Martin Keeler. Hello.\nMartin Keeler (MK): Hello there, lovely to meet you.\nNC: From the online learning and educational technology provider Udemy, we have Chief Marketing Officer Genefa Murphy, whose company charts global learning and skills trends. Hi Jennifer.\nGenefa Murphy (GM): Great to be here.\nNC: And we've the founder and CEO of the Skills Builder Partnership, which brings together 850 plus organisations, and in the last year delivered more than 2.3 million programmes to boost essential skills. Welcome, Tom Ravenscroft. Hi, Tom.\nTom Ravenscroft (TR): Thanks very much.\nNC: Well, just for fun, seeing you're all into your skills, I mean, here's a quick question to start with. I just wondered what's the most offbeat or improbable skill you have? And has it ever been of use for you at work?\nTR: Well, I'm glad to kick off, Nigel, because I think this is; when I was reflecting on it, I realised I had a very important skill which perhaps will be revolutionary to the world, which is I've developed a method to stop my own hiccups.\nNC: Impressive.\nTR: Which I'm very modestly calling the Ravenscroft method, and which just requires you to grip your diaphragm very, very hard for five minutes and hiccups stop immediately. And I think it's going to be pretty, pretty revolutionary, actually, when it's out there.\nNC: Yeah, I'm not even going to bother to ask you whether that's been of any use at work. Genefa, what about you?\nGM: I'm going to say that my skill is artistic doodling. I am no artist by any means, but I would definitely say I have a skill in artistic doodling. And it definitely helps me at work, helps keep me focused.\nNC: OK, so that's official permission. It's fine to doodle in your meetings then, Genfa.\nGM: 100%. 100%.\nNC: Martin, what about you?\nMK: So, I think my superpower actually comes from, I was diagnosed as dyslexic when I was 34. And apparently it means my long-term memory is much better than my short-term memory, which, as I get older, is really coming into play at work when I have these moments of sort of, twenty years ago, I'm pretty sure we did this and I can remember it like yesterday. Sadly, I won't be able to remember the next day who I was in the meeting with the previous day. But yeah, it's really been coming to its fore at the moment. Even the unions are looking at me going, how did you remember that?\nNC: OK, well, maybe one skill we don't all need, but Tom, I mean, these skills gaps are everywhere, tech skills to do specific tasks and of course, people needing those transferable skills to progress at work and indeed in life itself. I mean, where do we start? But where are the biggest gaps that need plugging, would you say?\nTR: I think there's something really fundamental, which is around what we call essential skills at Skills Builder, but which other people call 21st century skills or soft skills or transferable skills. And I think one of the challenges we've got is that it's got all those different labels to it, but actually what people mean underneath the labels is pretty stable, right? So, we're looking for people with communication skills, with interpersonal skills, people able to manage themselves and people who are able to creatively solve problems. And I think what's really interesting is that that set of skills has remained remarkably consistent over a long period of time and employers like to recruit for it. But I think they really underinvest in actually building those skills in their own workforces.\nNC: They might, Genefa Murphy, just be worried people will leave if they give them too many skills, it's a terrible thing, but you do hear this.\nGM: Yeah, it's a massive fear. Definitely a lot of the customers that we work with, they talk about, OK, well, what are we trying to do? We're trying to retain our employees. But I think at the end of the day, especially with the multigenerational workforce, people want to be able to grow their own careers. They want to be able to shift careers. And, you know, listen, they still want to have loyalty to an organisation where it makes sense. But they want opportunity. And that's really what skills are all about, is giving people opportunity.\nNC: And Jennifer, what's actually shown up from the work you've done recently about how we need to tackle this?\nGM: Yeah, it definitely supports what Tom was saying. I mean, we've seen especially things like creative thinking. We saw a 103% year over year surge in problem solving and creative thinking skills, adoption and consumption on the platform, because I think especially with the advent of AI and technology, those types of skills are becoming even more prevalent. The ability to add that human in the loop, that human touch piece to it has been really important.\nNC: OK, now, Martin, we'll get on to some of the lessons of your particular programme in just a minute. But I wonder, I mean, why are we talking about this now? I mean, people have always needed skills. Is it just that with this AI and everything, the world's just changing too quickly for us? Why are we having to play catch up?\nMK: Well, I think we've always talked about people needing skills. And certainly, in my period in HR, which has been quite a period, people always talk of skill shortages as well. So, I don't think I've ever been in a meeting where I say, you know, we have an abundance of skills here and we just don't know. I don't know how we're going to moderate it down. So, I think what's needed changes but you're always working in an area where the skills are required. And particularly for me and the Government Property Agency, this was a civil service organisation. They're really good at setting up public serving organisations. I would say traditionally, we're less good at the delivery operational side of things that you get in the private sector where it's very commercial and very pressured, and in the property industry in particular, you know, some very specific set of skills, technical skills you need. So, you know, our area was actually giving confidence to our clients and our customers that we had those technical skills, and we were able to build those technical skills to get the best of the civil service together with the best of the private sector, which is exactly where we're aiming. But, yeah, I think it's always been a subject. It's just the content changes.\nNC: OK, let's just look at the terminology a little bit, Tom. I mean, we've got skills training, re-skilling, up-skilling, lots of concepts. You slightly alarmingly said to me before we started recording that up-skilling is a black box.\nTR: Well, I think...\nMK: What do you mean by that?\nTR: Yeah, I mean, I think I think that's one of the really fundamental challenges around upskilling, right? It's that I think all too often we don't really have that much awareness of the skills that we have because we take stuff that we can do for granted and often then we get cross that other people can't do stuff that we can do because we sort of presume it's intuitive because we can do it or we call it common sense or whatever. The other side of that, though, of course, is that if we don't know what we're capable of, probably we have a slightly hazy notion of where the frontiers of those capabilities are. And actually, I think it's really important that individuals understand where those frontiers are, both so that they can appreciate what they've got and fill in any gaps, but also so they can keep thinking about what, what progression looks like. And so, one of the things that we've worked very closely with CIPD on developing is this universal framework for essential skills, because we're finding that actually these were really important skills, but people had a very hazy notion of whether they were effective communicators or effective leaders or working with others. And so, actually, by really breaking those skills down into small constituent steps, we're able to help people to better understand which parts of that skill could they do at the moment and which, because everyone has a development area, which of those were the next development areas for them. I think once you've got that sort of that model, that conceptual map, then actually you can take a lot more ownership over your skill set.\nNC: OK, and Genefa, while you're kind of mapping skilling issues, I mean, have you come to any sort of clear idea of exactly what we mean by upskilling so organisations can sort of work out what it is they actually need to be doing?\nGM: Yeah, and that's the challenge, because it's not just about what skills do people need, but also how do I validate those skills? So, we definitely see that when people and organisations are thinking about that's the biggest challenge. How do I identify what skills we need for the future? How do I understand what skills we have by skills analysis? What are the talent processes and opportunities to fill the skills gaps? And then how do we make this all work with technology as well? Because skills are changing, as Martin said, all of the time. And so, you can't spend, you know, four, six weeks, two months, three months going through a big skill analysis and skill gap piece. You have to make sure that you're able to do that on an iterative basis. And so that's where we see customers spending a lot of time is, OK, what skills do we need for the future? What skills do we already have? What's the gap? How do we close it?\nNC: And just still with you, Genefa, briefly, there are traps here, aren't there? Because if you keep firefighting the very obvious skill shortages, I mean, there is a risk, isn't there, that you won't kind of scan the horizon properly. You won't really assess the more profound needs.\nGM: Yeah, there definitely is. And also as well, I think. But the interesting thing is, yes, there is new technology coming out all the time. There's new skills coming out all the time that need to be refreshed. But those fundamental skills like leadership, change management, communication, coaching, those are critically important. You know, one of the pieces of research we found that 9 out of 10 employees believe that leadership is actually the most essential skill needed in order to be successful with Gen AI. So, it's not looking at the obvious skill, but the skill behind the skill.\nNC: Writing better prompts. That's what I would add. But of course, the leadership comes into it and people need to be on a very different path because so often people become these accidental leaders, don't they?  And they've just not got the right background to move forward.\nTR: I think that's true. But I think you also have a lot of people who are always overlooked, actually, in terms of their leadership potential. So, we did this piece of research which we found that, you know, if individuals through their career felt that they'd never got any opportunities to build essential skills, actually, their essential skills declined over all that time they're spending in the workplace. But actually, if they were having these repeated opportunities to actually build those types of skills and you saw them on a completely different trajectory. So, I think there's this real challenge, not just about a skills gap, but actually almost a skills trap where you assume too early what people are capable of, you stop giving them the opportunities that other peers might be getting to build their essential skills. And we really can't be surprised at the end that they don't appear to be developing in them.\nNC: OK, now, Martin, let's look at how this could start to work in practice. You've had a programme run which certainly the CIPD has been pretty impressed with. I know you could probably talk for half an hour about it, but just give us a sense of what it was you set out to do and what some of the early results have been.\nMK: OK, so I think like most private sector business, the question the clients were asking is, why are we paying for this service? And one of the key things that we do is you're buying expertise in the field of property management and facility management. And of course, the next question was, how do you prove your ability because all we see is the delivery and that can be great and it can be not so great, but how do we know? And also internally, I think we were asking the same question and a lot of our workforce were from a confidence viewpoint were kind of saying, I feel like I know what I'm doing, but do I? So, we came up with a mechanism of focusing on four key core skills, we call them. But we also then had those four core skills measured at four different levels, ranging from sort of awareness to expert. And we came up with the idea of self-ranking where you felt you were on that grid. And then also line managers and the individuals agreeing what levels were required for those roles.\nNow, the tool I already had in my back pocket was the enormous learning and development catalogue that sits in the civil service that I can just draw upon at any time. So, the one thing I didn't really have to do is develop solutions and it put them in a safe place because we weren't going to, it was done entirely through engagement in the workforce and the consequences were only positive. The consequences wasn't, oh, you've now identified you don't have the skills for the role, therefore you're in trouble. The consequences were, well, look, this isn't a scientific process at the moment. It's identifying a development opportunity. At the same time as doing that, though, we engaged with PwC to get some real thinking and points to say, actually, the next year we want this to be a more objective process where roles are assessed objectively, as are individuals. So, year two, we then introduced a 40-minute which we got down to 30-minute questionnaire, which then sort of spilled out the end what your level of competence was, which you could then compare to the role and then literally instantly puts together a development plan because you've got the metrics to say you need to undertake this development to get to the level you want to be. And I was able to say to the customer and the client exactly what our skills gap was. Now, one of the things that when I was questioning the CIPD, you know, what's the output like? Any company would want to say we have no skills gap whatsoever. We actually reported that we were operating at about 54 percent of our employees having the levels that were ideal for that role.\nSo, the initial question is, well, that doesn't sound great. And I would turn around and say, tell me anyone else who can tell me that percentage. Everyone else you're dealing with an unknown quantity. I know what the gap is and I've got a solution to fill it. 10% each year is our aim and that's what we're achieving to fill in that gap. But for individuals in a very short period of time, they come up with a selection of development plans that they can go into their performance reviews and say, I want to do this, this, and this to fill these gaps. But also, more importantly, they can then measure themselves against any job in the organisation. So, it's become a really powerful tool for our employees. And it's got rid of, I think, the cynicism. And it's, you know, it's all too difficult to do. It's turned it into quite a mechanical process that's easy.\nNC: And Martin, you say cynicism. Do you mean cynicism in the sense that some people might think if they're being asked to take on more jobs, they're being asked to skill up, they're in effect being asked to do other people's work for which they're not going to be paid or rewarded? In other words, are people a bit cynical about the whole point of this?\nMK: I think it was the thing I said at the beginning, plus something else, which is the cynicism of are you going to use this as a as something to hit me with? And it being genuinely a development tool that is taken in the right spirit moving forward. And that's why we did the soft year of making it absolutely crystal clear that there's no consequence as a result of doing this. There's still no consequence other than development but we had to really hammer that home. But also, there's that kind of like if it looks too good to be true, I don't believe it. Are you really telling me after 30 minutes that I will have a development plan that you will then deliver upon as an employer and I will commit to and contract to? And then we get up and running. And frankly, not many people believe that. Their past history would suggest that organisations, dare I say it, constantly saying development is really important. But by the way, you can't do that course because we haven't got the money or I can't do that course if we haven't got the time. We had to really put our money where our mouth was and say, look, we're investing all of this. But again, the business case writes itself. We get more business by showing our expertise.\nNC: OK, let's turn this straight over to Tom and Genefa then. This was a plan that clearly is working for this organisation, but every organisation is different and of course, then there's the question of all the different potential learning formats, how you skill people up, and how you monitor that and so on. So, Tom and Genefa, can you just sort of take that specific and give us some more general lessons in terms of what organisations can do to deliver more on this?\nGM: I was just going to say, Tom, maybe you can add on. I think you mentioned there about learning formats, right? I think that one is really important, and especially as you're looking at, again, things like a multigenerational workforce, looking at how do I create blended learning programmes in the workplace, making sure that you're giving people access to microlearning, you're giving people access to multi-platform learning. You're giving people access also as well. We love micro learning, but also as well, if you can actually learn a skill and you're going to apply it as a capability, especially with a lot of technical skills, you're probably can't do it in five minutes, like you'll get some understanding. But having that ability to have blended learning formats, blended learning programmes, multimodal, and then thinking about how different generations engage with content as well is really important. One of the interesting things we saw from our research on the multigenerational workforce is that actually Gen Z, who are going to be about 30% of the workforce by 2030, still prefer face to face meetings. Everyone thinks they're the digital natives. You know, it's all about doing things on Zoom, but still bringing in the face to face meeting element. So, I think looking at your learning formats and your learning modes.\nNC:  You're saying bring back the classroom?\nGM: Hey, you know what? Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes, yeah, it really makes a difference. You know, getting that interpersonal connections, you know, yeah, you can see someone's eye roll on Zoom, but having someone sitting next to you and being able to just give you a little whisper in the ear of a hint of something you can do when you're trying to apply a skill, hey, really helpful.\nTR: One of the things that's been really interesting about the Skills Builder Universal Framework, which we developed with CIPD, is that actually it was deliberately designed to work in lots of different settings. And so, I think the interesting part about that is that we've been able to see that actually, you know, whether it's Heathrow or Lloyd's Banking Group or Amazon, actually, there are these skills which are remarkably consistent across these different settings, of course they're contextualized and they're used in slightly different ways depending on the content. But, you know, these are the skills which enable people to use that technical skills and knowledge as well. And I think what we found as sort of the key phases on this to doing this really effectively. So, I think there's that point about awareness.\nSo actually, individuals having that understanding of their own skill set and I should say, you know, lots of this, I'm sure, is equally applicable to technical skills, too. I think then there's a really important place for explicit content. And actually, that's very normal for technical skill development, much less normal for transferable skill development. But there are really important components like, you know, for creative thinking, you know, how do you prototype something? How do you organise your ideas with a mind map? Like these are very teachable elements. And so actually having that explicit content is still really useful. But I think that has to then be accompanied, as Genefa was saying, with the practice, right? These things only become intuitive if actually people are putting them into practice regularly. And then finally, I think having the opportunity to review and reinforce as well. So, where we've seen this work most effectively, you've got the real buy-in of line managers who see their role as helping to coach and develop their teams in building these skills. So, it's not just a one-time thing, but actually there's a really clear view of what the learning objective is and a manager helps to reinforce and to track and sometimes just to encourage and champion a person on that journey of developing that skill, particularly if it's not something that's a quick thing to build, as you're saying.\nNC: OK, actually, Martin, something Tom just said there reminded me about something that was in one of our podcasts a couple of editions ago, 211, I think it was, Learning at the Point of Need, which considered the folly of expensively training or retraining people to do things. It would actually be a lot more sensible to redesign the systems, the processes. So, they were actually more intuitive and they don't require so much training. So, there's always, I'm just wondering whether this is coming out of your own work, that when you actually start deconstructing what it is people are doing all day, you might find it's not terribly sensible. And obviously this is relevant, isn't it? Well, take the National Health Service, for example, that, you know, it's got to redesign itself for the future in exchange for being funded. It's a big thing, isn't it? And for a government department to turn itself around and do something differently, it's actually quite different. But that might be the answer, not more technical training.\nMK: No, absolutely. And it's one of the things that attracted me to the Government Property Agency. So, we are an agency of the Cabinet Office. So, you can imagine that the Cabinet Office has a number of conflicting priorities, and some of which you can argue you can't plan for because the phone rings and the world can change. Covid being a good example. But the good news about the Government Property Agency is it is more of an operational wing. And we've got, we've set ourselves up right to have a 10 year plan. And the reason I love it so much is it's got a real good social value, but it's actually got a really strong business case as well. So, in very simple terms, it's about saving the tax payer literally billions through having one central place managing its property portfolio for offices. And at the same time, giving a much better working experience to all the civil servants.\nNC: Well, when it comes to change for the better, it's certainly good and refreshing maybe to see HR in the driving seat of that process. And it's not some major government initiative or whatever. But Genefa Murphy, this is a good point, isn't it? HR organising this upskilling. I mean, identifying the commercial goals of a business, the skills required is pretty strategic. And I just wonder how HR people do that job properly. I mean, are they even party to the knowledge that's required to make sure the right skilling is put in place?\nGM: Yeah, I think we definitely see with our customers who are HR leaders and learning leaders, people leaders like talent leaders, they are getting more of a seat at the table, more of a discussion. And the real key there is, you know, they themselves have to have that key skill of being able to communicate and partner with the rest of the stakeholders, because on one hand, you know, you've got teams who are like, hey, go to a central organisation and I want to know what skills I need to develop for my team. But really, people don't want that, but they want someone to help them with it. They want someone to guide them. They want someone to give them a starter because at the end of the day, the CTO or the head of engineering, they know what skills they need for their organisation best. And so, the skill that we're seeing the HR teams really having and they have in earnest, and it's one of those secret skills, is the ability to communicate, collaborate, and then be able to extract the real needs out of the business and find a way to be able to do skilling at scale, because unless you've got a massive L&D department, there's no way that they can do that all centrally, so they have to create this hub and spoke model. So, scale is one of the biggest things that we see our customers talking about and having that skill to be able to do skill at scale.\nTR: I think the key point is that people really respond to measurability, right? So, everybody who has ever started any sort of exercise or routine or anything like that wants to measure if they're getting better at something. So, I think thinking about how we can help people to understand where they're starting from and then to be able to track and celebrate progress on that journey is really important. And I think that's actually even more important with skills which are not easy wins to acquire, actually more sophisticated, complex skills you need to have that pacing so that people stay motivated, stay engaged, know that the effort and the energy and the time that's going into building those skills is so important.\nNC: And how, Tom, does that correlate with the organisation's return on investment? Because this is not without cost.\nTR: No, absolutely it is. And I think what we've, you know, some of the research that we did, so we did a piece of research a couple of years ago which looked at employees' perceptions around essential skills. And what was really interesting was that, you know, 92% of employees said that they saw these types of transferable skills as being absolutely critical for their future success, but only about a quarter of them felt like they had regular opportunities to build those essential skills. Only 14% could actually name an example in the last 12 months where they'd had an opportunity to build those skills. And interestingly, more than 80% were saying that they would consider the opportunities to build those skills when looking at other roles. So actually, I think all too often employees are seeing the short-term cost of investing in building these skills for their employees. But what they're not thinking about is the long-term cost, which is actually all too often people are looking for roles as an opportunity to build those skills rather than thinking about how they could build those skills in their role and therefore develop and grow within the organisations that they're already in.\nNC: So do your programmes reflect that, Genefa\nGM: Definitely. And one of the things that Tom talked about right there is setting, and Martin as well, setting the metrics up front. Right. So, what are your business priorities? What are your programme outcomes, your learning outcomes, your engagement metrics? And then also as well, looking at things like internal mobility. I mean, we even see this for ourselves at Udemy. We've set ourselves a goal around internal mobility, looking at the number and the percentage of employees who get to work on a key project outside of their core domain because, again, people are looking for those opportunities to develop skills, but maybe that's not currently in their current job description and they need that opportunity somewhere else. So, we see with customers as well, putting a focus on talent mobility is starting to become more of more of a priority.\nNC: OK, so let's just try and draw this together then with a quick contribution from each of you, starting with Martin. Some priority actions then, from what you've learnt so far, what would you suggest people do if they want to make a bigger splash and really get to grips with the skilling?\nMK: So, I think it's understand what your business needs are. If you don't know what it is you're trying to achieve, then you're never going to achieve what you don't know. So, a lot of time, the bit that we don't talk about is the work that went into identifying exactly what those needs were. And I've talked a lot about the skills builder and core skills, but it's supplemented with the thing we call Gold Standards, which is specialisms because we are a specialist organisation across all elements of the business, which we then call a Gold Standard. So, for example, my team, CIPD Charter Level is classed as a Gold Standard and we then set ourselves targets. So, we're currently sitting at 40% of our whole organisation hold a gold standard accreditation, which is which is huge. But that was because we recognised as a business that that, again, was our selling point. You are buying in this expertise, you are buying in people who really know what they're talking about. Now, if we were more, you know, some of the organisations I've worked in were construction and it's much more sort of front facing, then you probably wouldn't have a target of that level. You'd probably have a much smaller proportion at that level. And then you'd go much more into the tangible day-to-day skills and making sure that they know the core skills element was 100%.\nSo, I think, you know, know what you're talking about, know what your business needs. And then put in processes that make it easy for people to participate, engage and shape and own it themselves and have the ability to deliver upon the promises you're making when you set that expectation.\nGM: Yeah, I think it builds on that. Right. So, identify the critical skills for your org. Get started. Don't overthink it. Create what you would call a skills framework or a skills tree. Match that to your business need and then scale it, iterate and scale. That's the most important thing, because you need to get started. You need to be agile. People don't want to have to necessarily wait. So, yeah, I would think identify, create, match and scale.\nTR: For me, the big thing is to think about looking up just those immediate technical skill needs. So, we, you know, spend too much time, I think, generally thinking about the specific things that people need for the role that's right in front of them right now, and actually thinking more boldly and perhaps a little bit more bravely about how do you support individuals to develop more holistically? And I think for the short-term investment that that looks like above and beyond just solving an immediate problem, I think what you end up with is people who are better able to be adaptable within a business, who have higher levels of ambition and drive. And I think that also supports productivity more generally. So, I think that's a, you know, a well worthwhile investment.\nMK: Can I add something to what colleagues have said on there? Because I've made it sound like everything was great. One thing that you said there is, you know, get going. We failed on a number of things, but we learned to fail fast. When we first launched it, the people who were satisfied were satisfied. But there was a lot of people saying, well, what about me? You've not actually captured what I'm doing and we use the success to build the momentum. But actually, when we looked at it, as I said, we had a firm brief as to what to do, we realised there were loads of gaps. It didn't mean everyone got what they wanted. There were some areas we said, no, we actually don't need that in the organisation. That's a tough conversation when someone says, that's who I am. Well, that's not what we need. But fundamentally, we very quickly went back and reviewed. I think we reviewed in like four months and worked out what was right and what we'd missed, what was perhaps not right. So, it wasn't all plain sailing.\nNC: Well, let me thank our brilliant trio. I mean, this has been such a refreshing angle on aspects of skills that I'm sure many of us have not even thought about. So, let me thank the Government Property Agency HR Director, Martin Keeler, from the Online Learning and Educational Technology Provider, Udemy, Chief Marketing Officer, Genefa Murphy, and Tom Ravenscroft, founder and CEO of the Skills Builder Partnership. And let me thank you, our listener, all of you for your support in 2024. This autumn, we were really chuffed to win a Best Podcast Award against quite stiff competition from some national organisations. We've certainly had some cracking guests and people topics this year. So, if you have a spare moment over the holiday, do have a look through our recent back catalogue on the CIPD podcast page and subscribe. You'll find a clear guide to the topics covered and full transcripts. We'll be back with you early in 2025. So, until then, from me, Nigel Cassidy, and our fine CIPD podcast team of Christian Adams, Derek Tong, audio wizzes, Joe Hallam, and Nick Minter.

However, while organisations seek to reap these benefits in the long term, the immediate challenge is to cultivate a culture of psychological safety from which these benefits can grow.\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Chartered Psychologist, podcast host and Founder of Zircon Consulting, Dr Amanda Potter; Leadership Coach, Phil Lowe; and Theni Paramaguru, Senior Adviser – Future of the People Profession at CIPD, as we explore how organisations can foster, measure and fundamentally maintain psychological safety in the workplace.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:36:19\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy (NC): Ominous silences in meetings, too much comfortable compromise or a blame culture, afraid of being ignored or even mocked if you speak up. Welcome to your psychologically unsafe workplace. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the award-winning CIPD podcast. Yes, we are now award-winning. We've won Best Podcast at the Memcom Awards for Professional Bodies and the like. The judges praised us for our inviting listener experience and making a significant contribution to the discussion of work and HR. So, thank you very much indeed for that. Now, psychological safety. The concept has become pretty familiar, yet McKinsey found only around a quarter of leaders actually try to create psychological safety for their teams. Over half of employees questioned by Gallup felt venting at work could have negative consequences. So, this month we're here with ideas and tactics to move the needle on psychological safety. What barriers must you get over? What gains can you expect? Well, with us, only right, we have an actual chartered business psychologist. One with a deep professional and research interest in this area. She's the founder of Zircon, a talent consulting business and hosts her own Chief Psychology Officer podcast. It's Dr Amanda Potter. Hello.\nAmanda Potter (AM): Hi, Nigel. Nice to meet you.\nNC: With her, a leadership coach and facilitator, holder of a Master's in Organisational Behaviour, working with the likes of BP, the NHS and the Civil Service. He's also a fitness to practice panel chair for the Nursing and Midwifery Council and sits on complex employment tribunals, it's Phil Lowe. Hi Phil.\nPhil Lowe (PL): Morning, Hi Nigel.\nNC: And from the home team let's welcome CIPD's New Senior Advisor, Future of the People profession, her interests span employee experience and culture change. And she's completing studies for her Master's in Organisational Psychology. It's Theni Paramaguru. Hello.\nTheni Paramaguru (TP): Hi, Nigel. It's nice to be here.\nNC: So, well, safety or a lack of it. I mean, I'm sure we'll all go psychological in a moment, but I mean, just out of pure nosiness, I just wonder what's the most dangerous place or situation to be in in a situation like this? Any of you might have been in?\nAP: Thinking about this question in preparation for this podcast was a really interesting one because it took me back to a time when I had to meet the global CEO of a potential new client. And this CEO had the reputation for making suppliers and senior leaders cry. And he was intimidating and he was determined to create holes in your science knowledge through his questioning. And the stakeholder who took me into that meeting went at lengths to apologise for that interaction because it was such an uncomfortable, rude and threatening situation where this CEO was really trying to trip me up and put me in a really uncomfortable place. The good news is, I'm quite confident as a psychologist having worked for 30 years. And I was also more scared, actually, of my co-director, Sarah, because if I did lose the contract after all the work we'd put in to even get in front of that CEO, she was more terrifying to me. So, he actively went out to make the environment feel psychologically safe. And so, for me, that one interaction was the one that really, really stays with me and has resonated for so many years.\nNC: What about you, Phil? What was your most unsafe moment?\nPL: Well, yeah, I was kind of thinking back about my experience with psychological safety. And, do you know, for many years, kind of earlier on in my career, I never felt a lack of psychological safety because I was so naive about organisational politics. And I would find myself in all kinds of situations where I'd say things, not realising that this was completely the wrong thing to say to this particular individual who was actually out to undermine me. But it was, I have to say, it was my wife who caused the scales to fall from my eyes once when I was in the middle of composing an email to a client where I'd had some really bad behaviour from a senior person I was dealing with. And I thought, we've got to put this right. And my wife just shook her head and said, don't do that thing where you feel you have to give them feedback. You need this job. And that, in a nutshell, is psychological lack of safety, I think.\nNC: OK. And Theni, you were saying your life has been surprisingly smooth or you've managed to avoid such danger.\nTP: I did say that before, but now hearing the other two examples, I can definitely think of some. I think, in particular, where I felt it most, just on a general level, is where I feel that someone's encouraging a sense of competition between me and my colleagues. And I think sometimes some businesses do that actively, in order to kind of, what they think, encourage performance, they think if they're competing, they'll do better. But actually, for me personally, and I think others, and we're learning this more and more, it actually can stifle good performance and stifle people from being able to bring their best to work.\nNC: Absolutely. Excellent. So, Amanda, I mean, clearly having a psychologically safe workplace is good PR. Nobody wants an unsafe one. But there is so many definitions around, aren't there? What for you is the most helpful definition? What we actually mean by psychological safety?\nAP: It's a great question. And before I answer, I'd love to make the point that Theni has just said about competition, because we have actually identified in organisations that companies that have KPIs and reporting measures and create a sense of internal competition have the lowest levels of psychological safety. But what's really interesting from our research is that psychological safety, we all know when we're talking about it, is an environment where people feel confident and comfortable to speak up, to ask questions, to innovate, and to learn from their mistakes, to share and openly learn from their mistakes.\nNC: Phil, do you think psychological safety is misunderstood? I mean, a lot of people might think it's just about, you know, just forgiving mistakes. You know, as long as we all learn something, it doesn't matter if people make mistakes. So, in a way, it's about what it isn't, isn't it?\nPL: Yes. I mean, one thing that it definitely isn't is about making people just feel fluffy and happy and, you know, like the world is a great place. I mean, in a way, I'd love to have all organisations feeling like that, but it doesn't tend to get the work done. You've got to think of it as a kind of dilemma between challenge and support. The teams and organisations with a lack of psychological safety are generally where there is high challenge. And in fact, Amanda's research, I think, bears this out. High challenge, but low support. So, in other words, you know, it's all about competition and potential punishment. The danger is, if you think that psychological safety is switching to the opposite, low challenge and high support. You get a kind of warm bath, which is, OK, you've made a mistake. Don't worry about it. That's fine. Just carry on. I'll sort it out. I'll pick up the pieces. And what you somehow need to do, it's a bit like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time but you've actually got to keep the support up for people, care for them as people, while setting high standards and making sure that you're supporting them to deliver those high standards.\nNC: OK, I get all that. But, Theni, it is a bit subjective, isn't it? The degree to which any of us might feel free to pipe up at work depends on so many factors and some of them are within ourselves. So, I just wondered if the CIPD itself has any kind of angle on what actually the desirable level of psychological safety looks like in an organisation.\nTP: Yeah, well, actually, the CIPD, we did an evidence review on psychological safety and trust, which are both distinct but interrelated concepts. And what they found, one of the most important things in the five drivers that they found were important to encourage psychological safety. And what they found was that psychological safety was the role that leaders and managers had to play as role models to demonstrate that they were really encouraging of people coming forwards. So, there were various ways they could do that. They could do that by providing autonomy to employees to help build trust. They could do that by encouraging constructive feedback and actually listening to that feedback. We've all been in meetings where leaders might encourage questions, but then they shut down the conversation very quickly. So, you can kind of tell when they really want a question and when they don't. So, I think that's really important. And then the other thing that came out in that review as well is also involving employees in the decisions that are going to affect them and that autonomy can also have an effect on wellbeing as well as psychological safety. So ,through these behaviours, there is multiple benefits to be had.\nNC: And yet, Amanda, you were telling me beforehand about managers who do all the things on paper that look to create psychological safety, but you say they mess things up.\nAP: Well, we have a theory in our organisation around good leadership and strong management and we found very often from our research that even the best leaders, even the best managers don't necessarily create psychologically safe environments, because if you think about those leaders who are pushing the hardest, they're creating relentless environments. Those leaders who are trying to come to the right decision might create very inclusive, collaborative, consensus-driven environments. And so, we are our belief is, actually, the path to hell is paved with great intention, and we have found that even leaders who are very high performing and high potential in terms of their own capability, they're not necessarily creating environments of trust, to Theni's point, where people are taking accountability and ownership for their decisions, or they're able to build resilient mindsets because of this very relentless, very hardworking environment that they're creating.\nPL: Just if I could, just come in on that, actually, because there's some research which an authentic leadership consultancy called Holos have been working with, and I think it came from the Centre for Creative Leadership originally looking at what they call stages of maturity somewhere in the middle, you've got, you've got a dichotomy between independence and interdependence, the kind of independent mindset is, I think, kind of speaking to what Amanda has just been describing, which is the world is competitive. No one's going to help me. I've got to help myself. I've got to go out and sort of get loyalty from people so that I know I'm safe. Then you have the interdependent, the next stage up, which is I can work together collaboratively with people and co-create something really good. And I think, Amanda, what you were just saying just made me think that, you know, nobody gets up in the morning and says, let's see whose life I'm going to make miserable today. But actually, we get up, you know, thinking interdependently, I'm going to be psychologically safe, I'm going to get everybody working together, working collaboratively, and so on. But by the time you get to your morning coffee break, the sort of feral nature of organisations has created a kind of independent mindset in you, which is people are trying to do bad things to me. I better hunker down. I've got to compete. I can't trust anybody. Now, I'm overstating it, of course, for the sake of a short story. But I think that's the trouble. And that's one reason why people who genuinely want to create psychological safety find they trip themselves up and they don't get it done.\nAP: I couldn't agree more, actually. And what's really interesting is we work with a major organisation across the UK, a national organisation, who found that their desire to create a highly collaborative workforce resulted in groupthink and consensus-driven cultures, which fundamentally undermined their preparedness to take accountability for decisions and their overall level of psychological safety. So, their capability models were driving the organisation towards this sense of group ownership, where actually what they needed to create was greater sense of accountability. Because otherwise people were deferring up to the chain of command all the time.\nNC: I'd like to explore a little bit more how psychological safety kind of works in organisations, Theni. I've seen this sort of chart of four stages, which begin just with basic inclusion and then sort of move forward into sort of learning exchanges, experimenting, making more meaningful contributions, and then being able to challenge people, you know, is the final stage. Can you sort of turn that a bit more into real life? I mean, I just want to understand a bit more of the value, the value of psychological safety.\nTP: There's a talk that Matthew Syed gave a number of years ago where he talks about the cultures within industries that where safety is of the utmost importance. So, in that talk, he talks about the health care industry and the aviation industry and this was a number of years ago but a lot of what he said then still resonates and kind of resonates more with the psychologically safety concept. And it also goes a little bit to the point Phil was making at the start around what psychological safety is and what it isn't because a lot of people think, well, it's all very well, you know, encouraging failure. But actually, if people's lives are at risk, you know, we have to be careful. So, in this example, he compares the aviation industry with the healthcare sector. And in the aviation industry, you've got a culture where if a mistake happens, there is a commitment to really understand why that mistake happens. It's not about the individual that, quote unquote, made the mistake. It's about what were the conditions within environment that led to the mistake? So, they really interrogate what happened and because of that, it's one of the safest industries in the world. So, plane crashes compared to hundreds of years ago are very, very rare. And it's because you've got that black box, that black box is interrogated when a crash happens. Whereas in the healthcare sector, you've got a sense where when a mistake happens, the focus does shift straight away to the individual. And that culture of OK, why did that individual make that mistake? Then leads to people trying to cover up mistakes or deflect blame. So, you've got this blame culture, which means that when mistakes happen, it's much harder to learn from them because people are more focused on protecting their role within that organisation. So, you can see how safety is important in both. But one, where you've got that psychological safe environment, you're able to learn from that mistake. And in one, it could take years and years to uncover. So, safety as a result, as in general health and safety, reduces. So, it's much less about encouraging mistakes, but psychological safety is about accepting that mistakes are going to happen. But how quickly can we learn from them?\nNC: Yeah. Does that have any resonance with you, Phil? I know you've worked with people in the National Health Service.\nPL: I have. And I generally agree, and I'll come, can I come back to that in a moment? I did also want to say, Theni, that I think it's absolutely right what Matthew Syed says about it. But I think if we look at the very recent examples of what's happened with Boeing, you can see how easily you can lose that. You know, Boeing had a kind of reverse takeover of McDonnell Douglas and a new culture came in that was all about making money, make money, make money. And then you end with a situation where they didn't tell the pilots flying their new plane that they'd fitted a computer that would make it go into a dive in certain situations. So, the pilots didn't know what to do. And that shows you how powerful I mean, Peter Drucker, the management writer, who said culture eats strategy for breakfast. And I think the Japanese saying, the fish rots from the head is also quite relevant to this, that you get a kind of a new directive from the top and it can undo all the work that you do. The NHS, yes, I mean, I absolutely agree. I've worked a lot in the NHS over the last 15 years and it's a kind of complex. Well, sorry, I'm not saying anything you don't know if I say it's a complex organisation but my observation is that I don't think anybody really understands how to make it work and what they do is they fall back on what's the latest model and they implement a new model and then another new model and then another new model. And the people doing the kind of frontline work, dealing with patients and service users, just start to sort of buckle under this relentless pressure. You have a difference, I think, between the people who deal directly with patients and service users, who kind of are motivated clearly just to deliver good care where they can. And then you have the people who are responsible for those people who actually have to deliver stats and numbers and cost savings and things like that. And I think they are the ones who are constantly driven to send down new directives, it just doesn't seem to work from my perspective anyway.\nNC: Well, it sort of seems to link back to what Amanda was saying earlier. How then, let's put it back to you, Amanda, how do you get leaders to get their teams to sort of deliver this high performance, while not damaging people's safety.\nAP: Do you know what? It really starts with each of those individuals and their resilience and their mindset, because all of the research that we've been doing has found that resilient leaders create safe environments. Decisive leaders also create safe environments, which therefore means that if we are turning up to work with a negative mindset, experiencing negative affect, we are more likely to use negative language, our body language is going to change and the environment, which is psychological safety, it's an environment, it creates a feeling in the room is going to be one of tension. It's going to be one of discomfort, so it very much has to start with each of those individuals, and it has to start with personal awareness and resilience. And so, if we want to create a really good, a positive, psychologically safe environment, we have to learn how to hack the happiness chemicals. Inside our brains, so if we're going back to the neuroscience, we need to work out how can we release more dopamine, the motivation and reward transmitter, serotonin, the mood stabiliser and oxytocin, the love and trust hormone, so that we feel more content, we have more self-belief, we turn up with more self-confidence and we create an environment where other people feel more confident. And therefore, the most important thing is they're therefore more likely to speak up to challenge, to ask questions and to create this environment of safety.\nNC: So, in practical terms, I mean, Phil, when you work with managers, you know, looking for promotion, learning to cope in more senior roles. I just wonder how you open their eyes up to all this. I mean, it's like teaching them to listen, not to be autocratic in many ways. I suppose you're sort of teaching them not to behave like they think senior managers ought to.\nPL: There are some levels of challenge in actually creating new behaviour that people can use to promote psychological safety. So, if you've got somebody who is genuinely motivated to change their behaviour, who's a natural learner, you can do a lot of great work with them and they'll try stuff out, and then you can come back and talk about it, and so on.\nA kind of coaching approach, and that can work. The trouble is that very often the people who are causing a lack of psychological safety are dysfunctional in some way. I mean, I'm using the term mildly, but they don't know they've got bad habits. They don't know what they're doing wrong, and they don't thank you for opening their eyes to it if you're an outsider. And generally speaking, what you have to do is you have to get their boss, doesn't have to be their boss, but somebody who they really respect has got to take them aside and say to them, in effect, look, your behaviour isn't working. And if you can't change your behaviour, there's no future for you here.\nAP: I think the habit point is one that's truly interesting and the reason it's interesting is very often the habits come from a good place. For example, leaders who create psychologically unsafe places are often those who create relentless environments because they push hard, they work hard or they look for consistency because they don't want to make a decision that isn't well-approved or doesn't land well. Or they avoid failure because they don't want to make mistakes or they're nice all the time because they want to create an environment where people feel like they're included and they're part of something that is important. But all of those things, so relentless, being overly nice or lacking purpose or too much consistency, all of those things undermine psychological safety but they come from a great place, they come from an intention of trying too hard.\nTP: We obviously have those leaders that lack awareness that Phil was talking about that don't necessarily want to or they know they've got a psychologically safe environment and they're happy about that. But as Amanda was talking about a little bit earlier, there's also those leaders with good intentions that do want to create this environment but might not be sure how to and they might be facing a culture where people are used to kind of staying quiet, where there's a lot higher levels of deference, where they actually might underestimate how much effort they need to go into to encourage people to speak up a little bit more.\nI know one of my colleagues who was a coach, she worked with a leader that said that almost had to overestimate and really kind of exaggerate when people contributed, to say, oh, thank you, Sarah, so much. That really means a lot, that you could contribute that or say, I really liked it when Matt spoke up about that and challenged me on that. It might sound a bit...\nNC: Possibly, I might find that a little bit patronising, perhaps.\nTP: Potentially but I think if a leader does it consistently and is able to say, these are the behaviours I want to see, because by just saying, I want everyone to speak up more, people might just be a bit like, oh, I'll wait for them to do it. So, if one person can do it and you can say, by celebrating that, you're saying to the team, this is the behaviour I'm going to be rewarding, and this is what I want to see more of.\nNC: And Phil, I love the way you put your hand up so politely just then.\nPL: It's because I don't feel psychologically safe. I can't just jump in without fear of retribution. Theni, I know I really agree with what Theni was saying, but I just wanted to pick up on the fact that I don't think it's patronising when it comes from a genuine place and the way, if you're if you're somebody who wants to do more of that behaviour, the way to make sure it comes from a genuine place is to is, you either love this phrase or hate it, but somebody put it as catch them doing something right. If you can say in some detail what I really liked about what you did in that meeting was and then describe it accurately. It's very hard for the person on the receiving end to say, oh, you're just saying that because they can see you've made the effort to see what they've done well. So, that's what you need to do. Now, it's a habit. We're talking about habits and you can use nefarious means to develop a habit. I had a client who used to write in his diary. 10.30am, give someone a compliment. Now, as long as nobody saw his diary, that's absolutely fine. He knew that he would forget. He knew he had to get into the habit, somebody else had a right-hand pocket full of marbles.\nPL: And every time they gave somebody a piece of positive feedback, they could transfer one marble into their left pocket. And the idea was by the time they went home, they had a left pocket full of marbles. So, you can, you can use little artificial means to develop it but I think if you do it with, with the right intention, it will come across well and it will have a positive impact.\nNC: Theni, I wondered if you could suggest any other things that should be in your toolkit or practices that HR might be able to facilitate to sort of help all this to oil the wheels somewhat.\nTP: Yeah, I think the other one which I spoke to a little bit very briefly was around giving employees the say. So, giving them a voice in any change that's about to happen or if an organisation is looking to make change, actually get employees involved from the very beginning because that means that they, they feel like they have a voice and they have a say in what's happening to their organisation, which will increase their levels of trust and also help them feel more psychologically safe. But also, it just means that they're more likely to be engaged with that change as well when it does happen. And in terms of research, Amanda, you've already referred to one or two of the things that you found. But is there anything else you can share with us that will just kind of explain what you can do and what the benefits are in real life?\nAP: There's two ways I'd love to approach this. There's one from the individual's perspective, how we start the day, for example, if we start the day by getting up, looking at the daylight, looking at the sunlight, looking out the window, going for a walk, meditating, doing some exercise, all those things. We're going to help us release those neurotransmitters that help us to feel good and content and have self-belief. So, therefore, we show up to work as an individual and we contribute to that conversation within the team in a positive way. Because, unfortunately, our brains naturally have a negative information bias. So, 80% of the information we store is negative, 20% is positive and those negative memories are like Velcro, and the positive memories are like Teflon. And so, because of that, what happens is we have to retrain ourselves to Phil's point. The point about habits is excellent. We have to retrain ourselves to focus on the positive and we do that by looking after ourselves, starting our day well.\nBut the other thing, Nigel, is to really understand how we feel. And so, we within Zircon have built a tool, a psychological safety tool, which we're currently having verified with the BPA, the British Psychological Society, which helps people to raise their personal awareness and their team awareness to understand against 10 scales of psychological safety. How do I feel and how do we feel and what do we do about it?\nNC: Makes sense. One other bit of research I know you've done. I'd just like to get a little bit from you while we're talking here is about hybrid working and I was surprised by how unsafe you found that was.\nAP: Well, we went out to nearly a 1000 individuals who were either hybrid or in person, in office or completely remote. And we assess their level of psychological safety using the questionnaire I just mentioned and so, there's 10 scales. The 10 scales look at 10 distinct aspects of psychological safety, for example, whether they are prepared to speak up and share ideas or whether they are consensus driven. Whether they feel personally connected or whether they are professional only in their conversations. They are two examples. On those 10 scales, we found that the teams that were hybrid had the lowest levels of psychological safety on 9 of the 10 scales. The teams that felt the most psychologically safe were the teams that were in person, in office, and the teams that were consequently remote, solely remote, were in the middle. And so, it's very much about that point that whilst we enjoy hybrid working and it fits with our wellbeing and helps us to be more resilient because hybrid workers are more resilient. Actually, it undermines how we feel in terms of safety.\nPL: Well, that's really interesting. Amanda, I love all your stats. You've got some fantastic research here. You can see how hybrid working can breed distrust around people. For a start, why do people always work at home on a Monday and Friday and come into work in the middle? It's very easy for people then to assume that they're just trying to go away for the weekend all the time or come back late from something.\nAP: I think one of the things we've realised from this research and having worked with clients since having conducted the research is that if organisations structure the hybrid working in terms of the location that people come into when they come into work, or the days they come in, or they create tea parties or do something fun when they're in the office. There's a reason for people to come in. They all gather in a single location. We had one client, Smart DCC, who've got these giant offices and nobody knew what colour floor they were in or what colour area they were working in. So, they were all coming into work, but they weren't together as a team. So, there seemed little point.\nPL: That really makes sense because the sense of belonging is a fundamental of psychological safety. If you're partly at home and then you come in, you don't know where you're supposed to sit. There's a couple of real basic levers about psychological safety that this speaks to. One is significance, you know, it's a basic motivator for everybody. I want to feel like people notice me. I want to feel listened to, I want to feel like I matter and clearly a psychologically safe environment promotes that. At the same time, fear is such a huge driver of behaviour in the workplace that an unsafe environment drives that too. I'm frightened to speak up in case I say something stupid. I'm frightened to make a mistake in case I get punished. And for hybrid workers, I guess I'm kind of frightened to come in because I don't really know what's going to happen when I get there and I'm frightened to stay at home because people think I'm slacking.\nTP: Yeah and I just because that research is really interesting, Amanda, around how in-person teams are the most psychologically safe. Because we associate those companies that are dictating and mandating five days in the office as those ones that are the least psychologically safe. Because they're the ones like the Amazons or the banking industry that they're known for encouraging their, not encouraging, mandating that their employees are in five days a week and we assume that's because of a lack of trust, they're focused on presenteeism. So, I just wondered if you had anything.\nNC: I suspect they may not be doing it because they've seen Amanda's research.\nTP: No, I think not.\nNC: Maybe everybody should look at it and maybe, you know, we could all do things differently. So, what's the prize here? Let me just ask you all. How an organisation is going to benefit if psychological safety is done right? Amanda.\nAP: So, we've recently run a series of workshops and coaching interventions. They're probably very similar to Phil with Network Rail. So, they had an engagement score of 15%. So, their net promoter score was 15% at the start of the project. A team who are feeling very unsafe and very disengaged and through a whole series of interventions around psychological safety, we have managed to improve that up to 79% over a year. And the result has been incredible because the amount of innovation, the preparedness to come up with new ideas, the amount of challenge that they're giving each other has increased monumentally because of their level of engagement and because of their level of psychological safety.\nNC: I wonder if more trains are arriving on time, maybe not a similar percentage.\nAP: Well, eventually. So, this is the Innovation Centre. So, definitely they will be but eventually that would have a great impact. So, on that one team and the rest of the business, the level of engagement has been incredible.\nNC: Phil, benefits?\nPL: Yeah, I mean, it's an overused word, but I think productivity in its broadest sense, it has to come from people who are more motivated. If you follow that idea of significance, if a climate of psychological safety makes people feel like they matter, they will almost certainly contribute more to their work. And if they contribute more to their work, the organisation will get more. I mean, I think in terms of innovation which I know has been mentioned before, I don't want to use productivity as feeling like a sort of rather mundane word. I mean, in general sense, they produce more innovations, they produce more products, they get better results. Turnover will be lower in terms of staff, which is a huge cost, of course, to organisations, all kinds of benefits. I won't go over it here, but if anybody wants to look up Google's Project Aristotle, that was a big project that looked at the benefits of having psychological safety first. And they measured it in numerical terms, in terms of income, and in terms of turnover and other measures like that.\nTP: Yeah, I think Amanda and Phil have touched on the headline benefits in terms of performance there. But I also think it's something that we should really consider within the context of diversity and inclusion. So, a lot of companies are sort of feeling that their diversity and inclusion sort of efforts are stalling a little bit and I think one of those reasons is that it's all very well having a visibly diverse team. But if all the voices within that team don't feel that they're able to speak or contribute, then you kind of there's almost no point, really. Whereas if you create a psychologically safe environment, that means that all of those different voices you have in their team can actually contribute something. An example that comes to mind is that I've got a friend who has an ethnic minority background, and he joined the team as quite a junior member and he was invited onto the recruitment panels for quite senior employees that they were looking to bring into the organisation. And he was like, this is great like, I get to be involved in the recruitment decision of someone really senior, but he didn't feel like he could actually contribute to any of those discussions. They were, he was there almost as a tick box exercise. He was, he was there, he was in the room, but he wasn't contributing or influencing those decisions. So, that really speaks to the point about how important it is to make sure that you not only have a diverse team, but that individuals within that team actually have a say.\nNC: I was trying to draw this to some kind of a conclusion to sort of go around to all of you, some sort of tips. I mean, I won't say quick wins because this is not that kind of a thing, but stuff that you can do to make sure that you are creating a safer workplace, but not one which is just kind of too safe. Speaking to what Phil was saying earlier, I heard this phrase, an employer was wanting good vibes only. I mean, that's a bit creepy, isn't it?\nAP: Good vibes only is the opposite of psychological safety, surely.\nNC: Absolutely.\nAP: So, I would not start there actually. Personally, I would start with the foundation of psychological safety. So, from our research, we've identified that trust, personal connection, and purpose are the three aspects that are the real foundation of site safety. So, if we get those three things right, then we're more likely to create an environment where people are prepared to speak up.\nNC: And quickly, how can people managers, HR, try and engender that?\nAP: Well, we could start with the point that Theni and Phil were talking about, which is firstly, appreciation and gratification. If we're more likely to celebrate successes, if we're more likely to show appreciation, both to ourselves and to others, and to show gratitude to other people, we're more likely to create an environment where people feel included and feel like they can be themselves. So, it's a really simple one, which is to do a gratitude exercise or to show appreciation for colleagues. The 10 am point in the diary sounds strange, but actually it's a fantastic idea just to remind ourselves to say thank you a little bit more.\nTP: Yeah. And to build on that point. So, yeah, I think the recognition piece is really important. Another one would be to, in order to role model, the idea of psychological safety would be for leaders and managers to encourage feedback and do that in different formats, not just in a team meeting where everyone is there, because not everyone will feel comfortable doing it that way. Just encourage people to come to you one-to-one and say, I really want to hear kind of what's working for me and what's not. That's the need for role modeling, what they want to see within the team and encouraging employees to see that they have a voice.\nPL: Yeah, on the assumption that you're someone who wants yourself to create a bit of psychological safety around you, a very good starting point and really easy to do is next time someone talks to you, give them your complete and undivided attention. Never happens in organisations because everyone is multitasking, but it will increase the significance that the other person feels no end. They actually feel someone is listening and taking them seriously.\nAP: A brilliant book, Phil. A Time to Think is a brilliant book, which really covers that, of course. We get our best ideas, our innovation, when we believe we are being listened to.\nNC: Well, we've all got lots to do after this conversation. Let me just thank Authentic Leadership Coach and Facilitator Phil Lowe, CIPD's Theni Paramaguru, and Amanda Potter, founder of Zircon. I think we've all seen how psychological safety is so much more than preventing bossiness or just listening to people. It's creating a whole environment where people bring their best ideas forward and collaborate for success. Difficult, but so worthwhile. Until next month, from me, Nigel Cassidy, and all of us at CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:30:47\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: What's wrong with how we do workplace learning if costly skills training is soon forgotten? Why can't more learning be on tap at the point where people need it? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast. Well, so there I was trying to hang a heavy bathroom cabinet on a rather thin plasterboard wall, and the DIY place was full of rather complicated-looking metal cavity wall fixings, but I mean which one to choose and how do you put them up? The answer? Well, you've got it, I found and watched a YouTube video. Simples! Training at the point of need. So, this month we're asking why learning professionals don't take note and design content and tools to be instantly available to staff when they need them. Now I know what you're thinking, learning and development should go a bit deeper than showing how to complete job tasks. Yet is your content always accessible where it's needed? Does it bug you that you're somehow losing control of what people are learning? Well, with us the Leader of Learning, Knowledge and Performance Support for the health and life insurance provider, Vitality. He's also responsible for various operational functions across the business, which maybe gives him a different take from his HR and L&D background. It's the Director of Strategic Enablement at Vitality, Seb Tindall, welcome.\nSeb Tindall: Thanks, Nigel. Good to be here.\nNC: And with Seb, a digital learning and performance consultant who's had what she herself calls a rather squiggly career in retail, media, logistics, education and more. She's certainly built a big-name client list, focusing as she does on L&D, welcome Theresa Rose, founder at ConsultHer.\nTheresa Rose: Thank you, Nigel. Delighted to be here.\nNC: And Theresa, I was intrigued to see that, away from work, you're learning how to lift heavy weights in the gym, and you do a lot of salsa dancing. I just have to ask you; do you consciously apply learning principles to those hobbies?\nTR: I sure do, yes. So, I'm thinking about progression for lifting. It's starting with the basics of the correct forms and techniques, watching lots of videos and using apps and things like that to help me. I'm also a Vitality customer, so earning my points for Vitality helps as well, yeah.\nST: Great to hear.\nNC: Yes, I'm. I feel bound to say other insurers are available, but Seb looks pretty pleased about that. And I mean, do you kind of, seeing we're talking about learning at the point of need, do you find with steps in salsa, so you have to, sort of, mug up at the last minute or do you just sort of do it all long term?\nTR: Oh, now this is an interesting thing because everything's being talked about, skills-based organisations, isn't it? And there isn't much discussion around constant skills, so there are skills that you need to be using all of the time and without that particular fundamental skill you can't do the task or the job. So, with salsa dancing, the basic steps are the constant skill. You can't do the dance without the basic steps.\nNC: OK. And over to Seb, I know that as far as I know, you're not the owner of that cute dachshund on the Vitality TV ads, but you were telling me you do have an energetic 5-year-old. So again, do you, do all your learning and development principles work well with him?\nST: I don't know if anything works well with trying to raise a 5-year-old. I think the, it's a perpetually humbling experience, and I think the things that have really helped me learn about the profession of people development have been things outside of it. And I think watching, you know, a human learn the world, learn the tasks it needs to survive, you can kind of get lulled into a sense of trying to get them to avoid errors and trying to get them to stop, you know, doing things wrong etc. And that is a vital part of learning, is the ability to do something, fail, apply that back again and perpetually improve in, kind of, in day-to-day life. And I found it just a moment to really reflect on, you know, I know we're dealing with adults in the workplace, but some of the principles apply. You're never going to stop that person learning. You can't control it, and nor should you. All you can do is try and guide them in the best way possible in order to get the outcome required for them. And it's, you know, it's a timely and perpetual reminder in the household around that, really.\nNC: OK. So that's Seb and Theresa. So, we're talking in particular, Theresa, about learning at the point of need. I mean we get these phrases, don't we? We've had \"learning on the job.\" There was \"learning in the flow of work\", \"performance support.\" I mean is learning at the point of need, do you see that as something distinct, it's a \"thing\", a step further?\nTR: Yes, and it makes me reflect on when I joined the profession because, as you said, I've had a squiggly career and learning and development, the people space is something I came into around 14/15 years ago. And when I first started going to conferences, there was discussion around \"just in case\" or \"just in time\" learning. And the \"just in time\" learning, was that learning at the point of need and I've been in the profession over that time, it doesn't really feel like we've achieved that. It's still around, and there's still so much \"just in case\" learning. Even if we look at what's happened in digital learning over that time, going from interactive PowerPoints to e-learning to what I call now \"death by pathway\". So, it's gone from \"death by click next\" to \"death by all of this content put into learning pathways\". It's still just in, \"just in time\", \"just in case\" learning, sorry rather than \"just in time\" learning.\nNC: So, Seb, we haven't, if we haven't got very far according to Theresa, I mean that suggests that the whole profession, you know, needs to redesign its essential content and make it accessible.\nST: I'm never a fan of bashing the profession. You know, I think that the future exists. It's not, it's just not evenly distributed across the profession at the moment. I think if we, if you forget the definitions, you know the methodology. I think the irony about performance support, itis, it's methodology agnostic. If you think about the opportunity and you go, you know, you're a business you're trying to grow, you're trying to serve your customers in the most agile way possible in a challenging job market. Imagine the power of being able to bring someone into an organisation, sit them down in a chair and be able to seamlessly conduct that from the moment they enter the business, no training required. It protects the customer in terms of the interaction, all the processes are ergonomic enough to be able to figure them out and do it for them. Well, that's when you know you've arrived as a learning development function, and I think some people struggle with that notion because they want to see formal interaction with that individual. Well, it's as much about the ecosystem helping them to perform as it is about the inputs of any single support function in an organisation.\nNC: Well, in a way, you're not only challenging whether we need to have all this learning prepared at the point of need, but actually whether you should send people off on expensive training courses. What you're saying is that the work processes are the things that need revisiting.\nST: Yeah, I think you should redefine your influence as a function. And a lot of times, you know, and I've fallen into this trap myself. I sit here and you, again, you learn from a lot of mistakes in your previous career, but you might advertise, \"Isn't this amazing? We've trained people for 60 hours a year. Isn't that wonderful!\" By the same token, if I trained your people for six months a year and they didn't do any work, I'm the best learning development function in the world. Training hours and hours spent away from your job are not a good thing. In fact, they're a cost. It's actually going to cost you. So, you've got to be really sure that you're trying to find the optimum level between performance, going out there, being exposed to the role, learning by doing, and then reserving any time away from the role for it being absolutely necessary. I think that's the key distinction for me.\nNC: OK, well, Theresa, just indulge us a moment, let us assume that you do have people that need more access to the stuff that you've got somewhere sitting in the organisation. How do you try and get it out there? I mean, what sort of format might it need to be? Do you need new tools? What's the process of making it available?\nTR: I think, linking back to what Seb has said, it is about that ecosystem and learning and development can't do it all. So, it's where you work collaboratively across your organisation with your subject matter experts, but also understanding that people are going to be at different levels. So, there is a danger that subject matter experts are the expert, and then they don't understand and relate to what the novice does. And this is also about observation as well and going and spending time with your people in the organisation that are at different points in their experience with your organisation and looking at workflows, particularly around performance support. And that's where it started, really, it was about workflow analysis. That was where this performance support originated from. And I think you pointed out that that I've written about this, and going back into the research, and it goes back to the 50s, 60s and 70s. It's not anything that's new, as with most things, but it's that we've got more tools in our toolkit to enable that to happen in a more efficient and effective way now.\nNC: So, Seb, how does it work in your own organisation, Vitality? I mean, clearly people need to give the correct answers, there's a lot of compliance, people can't go off and do their own thing. So, how do you keep people on track and empower them at the point of need?\nST: There's a number of steps that we've, you know, we've created a bit of a custom process, but you know, I'm conscious of time, so probably draw back to some of the principles with it and I think, to Theresa's point. You can't do it all, but your first warning sign, if you're going to deploy a new process is, if it requires a lot of training to run a process, it's probably not a very good process. That's your first warning. So, if you're going to get together as an organisation and say \"that's going to be an issue. It's an inefficient process. The human brain is fallible. We could train them a lot; they'll forget a lot. There's going to be a lot of issues in there.\" So, we've got a process by which we'll go around, and we will assess the intuition of a process with the end users and say, \"OK, well, try and do it, try and do it cold with no instruction. What happens, where do you get stuck? Where are the issues?\" That's the intelligent point, number one intelligence point number one, sorry. Number two is, you start to work with all your operational stakeholders to understand what are the things that we just can't get wrong here? You know, there are some critical things that if we get them wrong, you just cannot recover from that and they become the real focal points of what you're going to do in terms of your resources. So, we have to get those things embedded in, ideally the processes mean that, you know, you don't have to worry about that because it's automated, but if it's not, you know that's number two. And suddenly, you're starting to bring together the stuff that's a really high mental load. The stuff that we can't get wrong, and that is going to inform that process, and it's great to have that. The final point, which is one that's quite often forgotten, is that perpetual feedback mechanism. You know, you leave any learning intervention, whatever happens, you are at best an enthusiastic amateur, at best. So, if I set you loose in an organisation, what happens to ensure that you actually continue to retain and maintain competence? And I think the question we ask, as a collective is, if someone goes out there right now cold and they get it wrong, what happens? Because it's far more important that that mechanism is right than any input into people's knowledge upfront, because it's got to perpetuate and continue long after the training is forgotten. And I think those threads kind of come together in our process to try and identify and understand criticality, ergonomics and, kind of, perpetual improvement.\nNC: Theresa, how does that all chime with you and the work you do?\nTR: Really very much. And I think what Seb's talking around there is things like critical incident techniques, is identifying those real crunch points and selecting what it is that people need to have knowledge where they retain it. Which is where you would need the training and/or the learning and development and things that people do on an ad hoc basis, which is where you might have the performance support or job aids so people can pick those up if it's something that doesn't occur that often and you don't need them to have that knowledge to use all the time.\nNC: OK, Seb, we're talking here a lot about the kind of run of work, the crucial stuff that needs to be done. But if we go back to my bathroom cabinet, I mean, it was still on the wall when I last looked this morning. But I mean, solving my DIY problem with a YouTube video doesn't make me a builder and I just wonder whether we're in danger of confusing or prioritising immediate task support with the kind of longer-term learning which organisations ought to be offering? You know, developing people's skills and capabilities, their future problem-solving, their decision-making. Are we losing sight of that because of budget cuts and everything else?\nST: There's a couple of points that have occurred when Theresa was talking it's good to pull out because they help to answer this question. I think number one, we just touched on, is frequency. You know, the amount of times that you might get approached as a learning development department to say, \"Every year there's this process and it happens once a year and people get it wrong, so we need to train them.\" You know, it's absolutely pointless to do that because by the time you train them, they'll have forgotten, and it runs around again. And the first sign of insanity is having to do the same thing again. So, there's a frequency piece in here to say, when you come to us, if a process is infrequent, that's all the more reason to rely on performance support and use that methodology because a fallible memory will fail you in between those instances. I think the second one is around performing your role here. Now, it's really difficult to connect with someone about future career, future skill needs if they're struggling to do their job on a day-to-day basis, that will not be their primary concern. So, I think what we're looking at at performance support here is, ensuring that the environment is absolutely supportive of you being able to do what you need to do, to buy you the bandwidth to do that, and there's almost an assumption that if you become, you know, really effective, if your efficacy is absolutely right when you're interacting with somebody, that you don't do anything else. Well, no, well, that preserves capacity to talk about skills that can be transformative for your organisation, to talk about scarcity, to start growing them in advance of when you need them. But you can't do that if you've got a customer on the end of the phone who's shouting at you because can't do what you need to do.\nNC: So, you've got to do it all?\nST: I'll take your word for that one, Nigel, but I wouldn't recommend doing it with the bathroom cabinet, you know.\nNC: OK, I want to talk about AI, Theresa. I mean, it's here. It excites some and terrifies others. I mean, perhaps we can talk about the part it might play in delivering your learning in a moment. But one aspect of it which seems to worry people is the loss of control. They've got learners asking for what they need, I wonder if there's a sort of, rather misplaced thought in the mind of some L&D people that they're, they should be controlling what people are learning, and they're losing that control.\nTR: It's a difficult one, isn't it? Because you want to stand out as a profession and showing support in your organisation and enabling people to do their jobs, but you cannot put your arms around and touch everything. And I experienced that when I was working in an organisation where we had significant cuts, both from an operational point of view in learning and development and also from a behavioural point of view. So, because we had those quite separate and I think that's also sometimes dangerous because we don't then sense-make for people in our organisations. And everything's very separate, the learning's separate and it doesn't, it's not joined up together to give them a holistic experience. So, what I found myself doing was collaborating with people in the organisation and equipping them to equip themselves because there was no way that we could do it on our own. But then with more, with things that were far more highly strategic, that were much bigger pieces of work, we had a process in place that made sure that we had both the resource, and it was a business imperative. It was going to deliver on key strategic objectives to say \"yes\" to that work. And detailed resource planning. That was how we really improved our learning operations and saved a significant amount of money, time and enabled people in the organisation, which is ultimately what it's all about. It's about people and performance.\nST: When we talked about AI, it's a tool. I think the dynamic thereafter is trying to control people's learning, you know, long before AI was around, people learn perpetually in an organisation. You better hope they do, because if they don't, we are, you know, every organisation is in a lot of trouble. You cannot be absolutely everywhere, looking at people all the time and controlling it. And nor should you want to. I think that the real nuance and skill of a learning development professional is to identify the areas either where they're most needed or where they can catalyse performance the most. But if you're there to control learning development, then I think there's a real inflection point for every professional to say, \"you don't want to\" because it's a key. It's a key support for your department and it's a key thing for an organisation to do.\nNC: So, while we're on AI, Seb, do you think that enables you to make more learning available at the point of need through using AI?\nST: I think I would probably change the question to an extent, Nigel, in that, having learning available at the point of need isn't the useful thing per se, and I think, just to use a provocative example, you know, imagine I'm speaking to a customer. I'm using it as an example because it's usually quite time-pressured, and they asked me about a complicated process. I'm not going to go and log on to a 20-minute module and watch that and get back to them while they're on hold. You know, I think if we move away from that piece and say, \"does AI look like a viable tool for advancing our profession?\" My gut tells me \"Yes\", but I'm yet to see it done really, really well. I think there's a couple of options where we've explored and we're utilising it. Trial and error of course, but I think that's the same for everybody. But I think when you do asynchronous events, everyone's learning at the same time. You know, you do lose a critical ability sometimes for people to question and add conversation, post that event. And what we've seen is you have the ability to not only scrape the questions that are coming through to shape the resources in real time, which is really useful, but you could also start to inform the LLM, the Large Language Model, about here's how we want that to be answered in the future. So, you're, you're almost increasing the accuracy of the responses on one side. But you're also trying to use something that people worry is going to remove a connection, a human connection, to almost enable it. So, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a grey area, but I do see it as a viable tool.\nNC: It's interesting, Theresa, I mean Seb has sort of, systematically demolished the premise of our discussion is that perhaps sometimes you might need to put learning at the point of need. I wonder, with your wider work with other organisations, can you see places and situations where it might be helpful? Because I just want to pin you both down a little bit more about how you get all the stuff that's available to people when they need it, even if we have to accept, from what Seb says, that it might not be while you're on a sales call.\nTR: Yeah, I realise I didn't answer the AI bit from your question as well and it's probably good because, listening to what Seb was saying, it's made me think around well, we have to train the training even. Because it's that accuracy of information still and Seb's point as well around losing that human connection is really key. And I feel like that's happened a lot, particularly during COVID and probably carried on, where we've gone far too much down the digital route and the view of self-directed learning which hasn't again really, really paid. It hasn't really paid back the profession and the investment in it because people do need that human connection. There's probably too much of people learning on their own and not together and collaboratively and, for me, learning in the flow of work would be more about those conversations and working on business problems in a collaborative way rather than. \"Here's some information because you might need it here, mightn't you?\" That, for me, is where facilitation of learning in the workplace is the sweet spot, and that might involve AI as well, as a partner in that rather than as an alternative to.\nST: You know well, well, well what? I think it's important to try and be provocative in these discussions because I think, sometimes we're all violently agreeing, right? You know, we're all talking about the same sort of challenges. I think what I've witnessed, particularly post-COVID is, you know, a lot of hybrid environments existing. You can't ask that person next to you, so that a lot of those informal in the moment connections of kind of diffusing information from experienced individuals are lost.\nNC: And in a way that was learning at the point of need, wasn't it, when that happened?\nST: Correct, correct. And a very effective one, you know, some organisations you wouldn't have a learning development department, you'd go and sit next to someone experienced and away you go. And I think that, what you lose then is an ability to support people who were isolated early on in their career and that is a struggle. And that's something that the profession has to respond to, which, you know, certainly that's where there's expansion. I think the second one is, if you're an organisation that wants to automate a lot of high-frequency work, which we all do. You know customers want, have a heightened expectation of being able to deal with things when they want to deal with them. They don't want to have to call your contact centre and you're trying to make it as easy for them as possible to be able to do that. You end up losing some of the low complexity work into your organisation and what you're left with is quite judgement-based, difficult work. So, it's a very potent cocktail because you can't ask the person next to you and the stuff that's coming in is more and more complex, you know, sitting in that grey area. So, as professionals that's the real challenge is. Because I can't bring you in and start on the easy stuff because it doesn't exist any more. You need to be up to speed as quickly as possible because we want to have the agility to help our customers at the time they need it and they've never been more demanding and you need to do it whilst you're on your own, probably at home. And that is not an easy equation to solve.\nNC: And all this, Theresa, raises the question of; if your resources are limited, how you're going to deploy them to try and make this accessibility possible? I mean, I've got resources or courses written down here, but I'm not sure that's the answer.\nTR: I know somebody that probably would say it is. It's again, it's like saying, well, not well not one solution is going to solve all of your problems, but it's also understanding well, what is the problem? Because often the presenting problem isn't the problem that you need to solve. It's doing that research and delving underneath to find out what it is and that either/or courses or resources. Because you know, I'll go to courses, and I'll use resources and they help me in different ways for different things. So, it's not about throwing out the baby with the bath water. It's choosing. It's choosing, as I said earlier, the right, we've got so many tools in our toolbox now, as learning and development professionals that are learning tools and tools beyond, far beyond learning and development. But it's thinking creatively how you can use them and it's making people's working lives and your customers, as Seb's pointed out, it's your customers ultimately, making their lives as easy as possible. And it's going back again to those, where are those critical incidents? Well, what data in your business have you got to say that these are failure points or are you creating more failure demand?\nST: I think I've learned a lot over the years and that's a lot from doing it, probably quite badly at times. I remember thinking, \"oh, this is great\", you know. But, at this point, when they want to serve a member, a screen pops up and there's, you know, there's four pages of information. There's everything you need, you know, isn't that a great idea? Amazing! And people just kind of, \"no, that's terrible. That's the last thing that you want to pop up at that point, because it's confusing and it's just going to alienate the customer.\" I think we came to the conclusion quite quickly that, and you get this question of \"what is a resource? Tell me what it is?\" you know, \"Be specific!\". The reality is, it's whatever helps people do their job. It doesn't matter how ugly it is as long as it helps them do the job, that's the pertinent thing. I think when we talk about resources and courses, it feels like it's a binary choice. Well, it's not and I think the reality is, if you can become really adept at what you do, you've gone from leaving your job to do learning to come back to it, then to try and apply it. People progress as a profession then, and you started to do some application in the training room. Then you started to blend it a little bit and that's great, you know, right at the end of that spectrum, you know, into the future, for me, is pre-emptive error avoidance. Systems that can start to understand what you're doing at the time that you're doing it, you know, and if you deploy AI well, it can listen to the conversation. So, it can start to surface things and say \"oh, you forgot to do this\" or \"you haven't quite done that\". And actually, you ensure that there's error avoidance to support that person to get to that that highest level of customer service but also performance in their role. But I kind of, you know, I think we've moved past that resources/courses conversation as a profession. But I think what we need to almost unite on a little bit is what's the future state? And for me, it is trying to get to that pre-emptive point of error avoidance.\nNC: OK, so trying to bring this together, Theresa, if we've slightly demolished the premise of having lots of information popping up at the point of need, which Seb has already made clear, is not helpful in his organisation. You must have some thoughts on how you can make a greater body of information that people need available to them when they need it.\nTR: Yeah, it's something that we haven't talked about but there probably is a lack of in our profession, is content management. And where and how you're using that content and keeping a catalogue because we know we get learning management systems that get, you might search for an item, and you get thousands or hundreds of the same thing to try and search through. I mean, I've done that, gone into my systems and typed things and thought, \"Oh my goodness, we've got all of this.\" And then you haven't got the proper tagging. That's going to be so critical, is the tagging of your content and your content management, particularly with artificial intelligence. I think that is one thing, you start to look at all of what you have and where you can reuse it and repurpose it and what you need to get rid of and how you manage that content as well and who it serves. Where and where and who and how it serves and as to, to go to Seb's point, if it does the job it doesn't have to be all lights, bells and whistles. If it does the job for what people need, great. And getting their input as well and spending time observing in your organisation and looking at what all the pain points are and using that are most important data.\nNC: And in fact, Seb, the AI might actually help you drill down into that information you've already got somewhere?\nST: Yeah, I mean Theresa made a couple of really, really, really good points that would be good to draw out, I think. First and foremost, being ugly, but just about doing the job is my calling card, you know, it's something I've been known for in the industry. It applies to resources too. I think the second point is almost around that knowledge management piece. It's such an important point to make there that the more you're able to curate an architecture that supports performance, the more you have to maintain it, and you almost start to move to a behind the scenes architect as you do this role. And I think that sometimes that's a really challenging thing for people to start to get into. It's a noticeable shift in our profession, where I think it was seen as a quite distinct skill set: knowledge management. But now, you know, to the point around pathways, curation is such a key part of it that it's not just what resource do you use? The ergonomics, is it accessible? It's also kind of how is that continually developed to make sure that it's reaching the optimum state for that person? And that's quite a tough pivot for a lot of people to make just from administering a course and updating that instead.\nNC: OK, I think that's a great point to end on. A massive thank you to both of you, I mean, clearly real specialists in the field and I love the way you've, sort of, challenged the premise, but given us lots of new insights on it. That's Theresa Rose of ConsultHer and Sebastian Tindall from Vitality. I'll just mention, there is another CIPD podcast on the stocks which some might find useful as an adjunct to this episode. It's number 181, where we zoomed in on learning transfer, how and why learning does or doesn't stick. And one lesson there was that learning rates vastly improve where people are made accountable for using what they learn, and managers are accountable for making sure they do. That sounds more threatening than I intended, but that's our podcast for now. Until next time from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us at CIPD until next month, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:26:19\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: So, what do we need to make the best use of our people? Data. Absolutely, but how do we use it wisely to build more productive and fairer workplaces? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast. Now, the best-performing organisations understand their people and what they're capable of, and ever more, do that by amassing a lot of information on staff performance, engagement, and much more. But being data-driven is easier said than done. I mean, how do you know what data to capture and what to do with it to boost productivity and make a difference in key areas like recruitment and retention? And how do you get more confident in handling people data, and where possible, make it accessible so all employees can use it to make better decisions? Well, joining me this month is a chartered CIPD fellow with long HR experience across a number of sectors and now developing practical solutions to people challenges. She's Director of People Consulting at Grant Thornton, Katie Nightingale. Hello.\nKatie Nightingale: Good morning.\nNC: And we've a computer science and human resources graduate who started her career in the private sector, developing a deep interest in how the people profession can contribute to good work through technology. It's public policy and HR practice senior advisor, Technology and Analytics. Hi, Hayfa Mohdzaini, Hello.\nHayfa Mohdzaini: Hello.\nNC: So, Hayfa, let's be crystal clear what we're talking about here. I mean, in simple terms, what are people analytics? Because you get these other terms, don't you? People data, people metrics. Are they interchangeable? Do they mean exactly the same thing?\nHM: So, in simple terms, Nigel, people analytics is about solving business problems using people data. And what we mean by people data is literally what it says on the tin. Data about people. This could be, for example, how long you've worked in the company, your performance rating, for example, and perhaps your demographics, your gender, and so on. So, what we mean by people metrics on the other hand is these are measurements of the people data. So, examples would be your turnover data, absence levels, your average performance rating.\nNC: So, Katie Nightingale, give us an example of the current landscape. What would you say are the main areas where organizations are currently using this kind of data to just try and improve their performance?\nKN: Yeah, I mean, we're used to seeing, you know, the standard stuff around data. So, attrition, maybe hiring rates and things. But I think organizations are seeing the benefit of capturing more data, rich data around people to support the business, to innovate a bit more around what's going on, and actually really focus where they're spending their time and money to increase the performance of people, to increase the experience of people as well. So, we're seeing much more data gathering around different demographics to make sure that there is much more inclusion in organizations. But also, how do we make sure that, in this more hybrid world, that we are understanding that people are getting the right engagement in a remote way, that they're actually getting, you know, the performance levels based on output. So, there's a lot more intricacies around the data that's required and how that is then shared as an organization to make the best decisions.\nNC: OK. And we can go a bit more deeply into some of the potential areas in a minute. But Hayfa, do we actually know that strong people analytics do lead to improved outcomes? I mean, has the CIPD got any findings on this?\nHM: Good people analytics can help you hone in on where you target your HR initiatives so that way you don't waste time on things that don't really matter.\nKN: You know, the thing is, we're seeing a lot more around, you know, data helping us understand, you know, what's the connection and the correlation between capturing people data and the input on the bottom line for organizations. If you look at that correlation with organizations around profitability of when you know, you're actually seeing greater engagement, you do see a positive correlation. So, I think, you know, in terms of kind of that empirical evidence, that evidence out in business capturing that data and making sure that people are doing some focused initiatives, we are seeing a positive improvement.\nHM: If you have good data to make decisions, then you make more informed decisions, then you're not making decisions on gut feeling. Obviously, it's important to use relevant data, and that's where people normally fall over. And that's where we need to be careful about what metrics we choose. And what questions we ask in the first place.\nNC: Well, that does bring up a really important issue, doesn't it, Katie? Many people, certainly some employees, would say people data has a dark side, doesn't it, when it's clumsily introduced, say, to monitor the productivity of people on minimum wages, for example, in warehouses. I could give you lots of other examples. I mean, one springs to mind that I saw recently of the boss of INEOS, Jim Ratcliffe, was complaining about a 20% drop in emails on a Friday when staff were working from home, clearly those people's work was being monitored. I mean, he clearly thought that told him something about productivity, which I suppose it might have done, but it might not.\nKN: I think it's really dangerous that people just look at one data source and suggest that people aren't working. So, a lot of people you'll find on a Friday use that as their administration date, which means you might see, again, a correlation with emails going down, but that doesn't mean to say productivity is going down. So, it's very dangerous if people take one source of data. You must look at multiple sources to then give you that richer picture around what's going on. And I think that's where organisations struggle and where you get a natural distrust around data because people are looking at just one or maybe two and making quite sweeping kind of conclusions around what that means.\nNC: And I guess this is particularly dangerous if there's an algorithm of some kind been built in. So, people are seeing results, which actually, they're actually biased, and they don't know. They reflect their own biases.\nKN: Absolutely. And I think we also have to be conscious that the work that we do across industry with HR functions and businesses is often, you know the data is only as good as the input that goes in there. And actually, making statements on just data you're getting from different sources, you've got to look at the broader data sets around the lived experience. And that's what I mean about different data sources, not just what you're grabbing from a spreadsheet somewhere. So, I think there's a lot more to be done around making sure that you've got a proper data strategy, you understand where you're pulling that data from, you understand how cleansed is that data, and making sure that you feel comfortable and confident that if you're putting those stats out, whether it's internally or more, kind of importantly externally, that you can stand behind that data and then make the right decisions because that can be really dangerous. And then again, it just breeds this distrust of kind of, decisions that are being made. If you're hanging it on certain data points.\nHM: Yeah, just to add. So, the CIPD really calls for people professionals to be to do evidence-based practice. So, apart from expertise and other sources of data, do consider, scientific evidence, there's lots out there. And you can also look at the CIPD website, there's evidence reviews, bite-sized research, certainly around, there's a bit of tension when, especially Katie mentioned, around the move to remote working. That's a slight change in how people do work and therefore, there's tensions around how people's performance should be monitored. And certainly, we highlighted in the talk piece around what monitoring measures are acceptable when managing remote workers. We found that where it's not obvious why that monitoring measure is relevant and necessary. People question the value of it. So, for example, if you know, tracking billable tasks for clients is a normal practice, say in the accountancy firm, doing that at home is equally fine. But if that's something that was not practiced before, people might question the value of it.\nNC: I was chatting to somebody the other day, Katie, who mentioned that her organization collected data every year on staff concerns, but never acted on it. And I mean, that sort of thing itself would undermine trust, wouldn't it?\nKN: Oh, absolutely. And I think this is kind of what I mean about kind of having a data strategy. And that's not just kind of understanding the tools you're going to use, the data you're going to gather. But what are you going to do with that? And how are you going to engage with people around why you're capturing data, particularly when it becomes quite personal data? And if you think about diversity and asking people about, you know, their sexual orientation or, you know, their social background or ethnicity, they're very, very personal. And obviously through, you know, what we've seen historically is that, you know, where people have been discriminated and these are protected characteristics that people are very nervous about providing that because it may be used against them. So, if you just go out and ask individuals that you want the data without explaining why you're doing that, but then more importantly, saying we've captured it, this is what we've done with it. And this is how it's made a difference to the organisation and you as an individual, you know, you're either going to make that trust go down in negative points, if you like, rather than, you know, making sure that people really, truly understand why they should give you that information or their perception of how it feels to work in an organisation. So, having a proper strategy around how you're going to capture, use, communicate that data is really important. But I, again, I'm not seeing organisations do this in a really robust way.\nNC: So, I wonder, Hayfa, have you got any tips or examples of best practice on how people who want to maybe step up their use of people analytics, but can do so in a way where people understand why this information is collected and it's collected in the right way, obviously compliant with GDPR, and that it will be useful to all in the organisation?\nHM: So, I'm thinking about OK, practical things, think about what problems your organisation is facing. Focusing on performance, are we looking at the organisational performance or is it individual performance? So, what is the question we're trying to answer here? And then look at what data you have and then understand how easy it is to get that data. If it's difficult to get that data, is it time to perhaps update that reporting system? So, perhaps if you're looking at within your area of work, you know, time to hire, is that an easy metric to get through your HR system? And if not, is it time to get help to upgrade the report? Or actually get a different tool to make that data easy to extract for yourself?\nNC: OK. Now, Katie, there's an evolution going on, isn't there, in how data is used to drive decision making, performance, and all that. We've mentioned some of the traditional areas it's used for. I mean, more on the positive side, where is this going? What sort of potential benefits are there out there?\nKN: I think from, you know, in terms of, you know, the HR and people functions really coming to the table. When it's about providing the organisation with really rich data to enable decision making, you start to become a commercial business partner. And I think that's really important. And I think that what we're starting to see is where organisations are leading in this space, they have got that rich data. They're working with organisations to kind of understand what they need, how they use that data. And they really pull on a number of different skills. And I think, you know, the skills part of this, you know, HR functions traditionally do not have those kinds of like those management information skills, that data analytical skills. And it's just not a natural skill set. But we are starting to see, again, those leading organisations really lean into that, but work with the organisation to provide data in a timely manner, really kind of focus on the accuracy of that, think about the engagement and getting all of that data, both internally and externally, to do that benchmarking. And then again, make really laser focused decisions.\nNC: And you've had things to say too about the behaviours affecting performance. been, you know, talking about those behaviours affecting performance. Absolutely. I mean, you know, if you don't focus in on, you know, how someone does something, which is the behaviours around that, if you don't focus on that and you just focus on the what, you're going to find that you're not going to get the best performance. So, and behaviours are quite difficult to measure. So, it's not an easy thing to kind of capture. But again, there's a lot of things that HR functions can do to set the standards, the guidelines around what that looks like and then be able to measure proficiency against that and again it's that regular communication, having development interventions which are aligned to that. But again, you need the data to be able to tell you, well, what development do we need? Where should we invest that money? And if we don't do skills audits, which is gathering data, if we don't look at that and understand how to use that data, you're just going to be kind of like a bit of a scattergun approach or a finger in the air about what you should actually be doing.\nKN: And that can be very wasteful and actually not give you the outcomes that you're looking for.\nHM: Yeah, to expand what Katie mentioned, so it's about understanding the questions and being laser focused. And linked to that is also the skill around storytelling and co-creating that solution with your business leaders. And I think, certainly as a judge at the People Antics Best Initiatives at the People Management Awards, I noticed that the best companies do actually work together with their business leaders to get that buy-in and also to gain a real understanding what the problems they're trying to solve for.\nNC: Does it require, Katie, a change of mindset once you are, I mean, everybody wants to say that they are data driven, but once you're really looking at this information to make your decisions, that maybe means that people need to shoot from the hit less and consult more. And that's easy to say, hard to do.\nKN: Yeah, well, it's a balance, I think. I mean, you know, you have to be confident you've got the right data, as I sort of mentioned. But there is a skill in knowing how to read that data. And as Hayfa said, you know, that storytelling skill. So, when we kind of talk to organizations and we do a lot of work, whether it's with HR functions or finance functions, and that whole kind of piece around, there's a there's a technical data analytical piece that, you know, you may need specific people to do. But there's an understanding, even as a business partner who is using much more of what we would call power skills. So, those skills that will enable you to do your job really well. It's the how.\nNC: Is that the same as soft skills? Power skills? I've heard that one before.\nKN: Yeah, no, it's really interesting. So, the problem we find is that when we talk about soft skills, it doesn't give enough emphasis around the powerfulness of those skills, you know, communication and things. So, we're shifting that narrative to be these are power skills. They are true enablers in order for you to successfully execute those technical skills that you have. So, I think that's where we're going in the fact that, you know, you need to have a balance of those. And HR, you know, HR professionals, as we move forward, really need to grasp that. At least have an awareness and have an understanding about how they can really kind of, you know, utilize those skills. They don't have to be a data analytical expert. But I think it is where the evolution is, is that, you know, we can't have job descriptions for HR functions without something around data analytics and storytelling and data visualization.\nNC: Absolutely. I love that. I thought I was too soft, but now I'm powerful. Hayfa people do find a lot of this quite scary. How do they get up to speed? How do they get a bit more confident in using more people analytics?\nHM: Well, firstly, you can visit the TIPD website and read the people analytics guide for people professionals. Secondly, look at what people data that you have. And if it's quite difficult to extract the relevant data you need in your day-to-day business, think about how you can make that easier. Whether that means getting better reports, working with colleagues or doing it yourself, or getting external partners to help you improve your reports.\nKN: I think to build on that, there is luckily now a new apprenticeship around HR data analytics, so, it's a data analytics apprenticeship but there are some that have been specifically focused in on HR professionals. So, there are actually qualifications now to build that. But I think, you know, notwithstanding, you know, there are those kinds of more qualifications and much more deeper dives. I think, you know, there are lots of sources out there around the best way to kind of capture data, what data to capture. You know, we do a lot of work with clients where they really are just starting out and (inaudible) I just don't know, where to start. And actually, just engaging externally with the CIPD, with other organizations to kind of get that confidence because, you know, you're not alone. You know, lots of HR functions are going through this same thing, but actually there is a lot of kind of information about this. And it's been a topic that's been around for a while, but I don't think we're quite grasping it yet. But, you know, I think that, you know, yeah, just reach out, you know, just to start looking at where there's sources of whether it's kind of individuals that can support or actual kind of formal qualifications.\nNC: And in fact, Katie, are there any kind of case studies that spring to mind of where you've been involved with bringing organizations up to speed with their data use?\nKN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, so we do a lot of work around kind of HR function transformation and that absolutely means systems, data, you know, digital solutions. And so, we worked with a FTSE 100 organization. And, you know, the expectation is that organizations in that space are going to be very sophisticated when it comes to their practices and their data. That's often not the case. So, what we what we tend to do is kind of help them understand what that data strategy needs to look like for them. We help to understand the data they've got, where they are at the moment, what they need to capture, who they need to speak to, to do that. And also, how they can make best use of you know the different solutions they've got already rather than going oh, I've got to go and buy an expensive system to do this. Absolutely not. You can do it simply through Excel if you needed to. But having you know the right tools to do that. But I think the important thing is helping. It's a culture and a mindset shift. And it is scary, as you said, Nigel, for organizations and HR professionals to make that move. But you do it slowly. You put a plan together. You bring, you know, individuals along the journey, again, tapping into where you've got that expertise elsewhere in the organization. And slowly but surely, having a bit of a pathway that will get people to their ambition around data just feels a bit more manageable. So, that's what we tend to do is kind of really kind of handhold. Depending on where organizations are on that journey.\nNC: Does HR tend to keep this stuff to themselves? I mean, we hear this term, the democratization of data. I mean, presumably you can't put all this information out publicly. But I mean, in many cases, if it's anonymized, you can provide access so people can use it to make better decisions themselves.\nHM: There are certainly more opportunities for HR to share data in safe ways with the people who can act on them. And certainly, thinking about line managers. What kinds of data would be helpful for them in their day-to-day management? It's quite normal within the self-service environments for line managers to have data around absences, holidays, performance ratings, data around their team members. So, having that data is good but at the same time, you need to support line managers to know how to use that data because not everyone is data-savvy. So, helping them interpret the data and being able to use that strategically in their work would be really helpful as well in terms of support from business partners.\nKN: Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a nervousness with HR professionals around data and how you know how you capture it. Because of the data collection regulations, you know, there are very clear guidelines around what we can capture, how long you can keep that for, and how you then share that. And I think sometimes that can create some nervousness around really using it. So, this is where I go back to this data strategy around what you're collecting, how you're collecting, how you're storing it, and how you're sharing it. But again, you need to make sure that you understand the boundaries around that, making sure that you've really thought that through before you start to do anything. So, you act on it. So, I think in order to understand all that, that's where the confidence will go to. Say look, we understand how we're going to do this and we're going to make sure that it's really transparent about what we do. And then make sure we're really clear on how we're going to use it and follow that through. But I think there is that nervousness around getting it wrong, because, you know, clearly there's, you know, there are huge implications for that. Not only financial implications, but also reputational damage if you get that wrong. So, I think we have to kind of get comfort around that to be able to go, well, look, this can be really powerful. Don't be kind of like paralysed by the fact that there is, you know, clearly regulations and guidelines that need to be followed.\nNC: So, Hayfa, how do you sort of signal to your employees that you are doing more of this? But this is the reason you're doing it, and these are the potential benefits in terms of organisational performance.\nHM: I think a classic example I can think of is around employee surveys. It's so easy to ask so many questions and people wonder whether any actions will be taken and how honest they should be in the answers. So, if you want to build that trust with employees, you do need to follow on through the actions that you said you would. So, you explain to employees, we need your answers on this because we need to understand how the organisation is feeling and what areas we need to work on. And then when you get that feedback, come back to them with the results and say, OK, these are the areas we're working on. This, you know, we've listened, and we've heard, and this is what we've done. And by establishing that rhythm, you create that trust over time and hopefully build that momentum for people to be more open with the area of work and together to improve organisational performance.\nNC: Because in a way, Katie, this is a big change, isn't it? From just sort of reporting organisational data, collecting it and sort of using it in a small way to sort of enabling strategic decisions are way beyond HR.\nKN: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, and that's what I mean about kind of, you know, HR can really have that seat at the table to give that rich data for the business to make, you know, really informed decisions. You know, if we think about finance functions, you know, they use data all the time. The reporting, it's a given. I'm not suggesting that they're all, you know, innovative around their data. There's still, you know, skills and development there. But I think there's a lesson to be learned around you know how that can really inform decisions. And I think it's just really kind of working in partnership with, you know, our finance, you know, and our IT colleagues to be able to kind of move that forward and really think through the different things. I mean, one thing that I still see at the moment around that is so important, you know, there's a huge kind of war for talent as we talk through. But yet I don't see really, really robust strategic workforce planning going on. And you cannot do that without both internal and external data to inform how you're going to kind of, you know, grow those skills, buy those skills in. And that is a really powerful thing that, you know, HR teams and professionals can help the business with. So that, again, we're thinking in the future and we're saying, well, you know, we know we're going to get a skills gap. We've got these critical skills. How do we make sure that we've identified them, and we understand where we need to find these skills? And how are we going to develop them?\nNC: And as far as the sort of productivity side of it, improving that, Hayfa, would you say there are any particular measures which do tend to have a good result when it comes to getting organisations to be more efficient, more productive?\nHM: There's so many measures and it really depends on the business. Nigel. At organisation level, a popular metric is revenue per employee. Obviously, if you're a charity, that might be phrased slightly differently. Because, you know, speaking in terms of profit. At individual level, we are looking, you know, it would be customized on that individual, whether it's, you know, number of calls or whether it's, you know, number of widgets they produce. When it comes to knowledge work, there's more subjectivity and therefore perhaps less opportunity for automated analysis of that where people come in. And that's where, you know, you would still be relying on manager assessment. And also 360 assessments from colleagues. But even in those cases, you could have that facilitated collection of that information, you know, through a survey just to make things easier to collect, the data to collect and analyse.\nNC: OK. And a final thought from you, perhaps, Katie, on making this work better.\nKN: I think, like I say, I think, you know, the first thing is to just, is to really understand, you know, what is it that you're trying to achieve? What data do you actually need to inform decisions? What are some of the, I guess the boundaries you need to put around that? So, this is where I keep coming back to sit down and plan this before you start acting, look, get a data strategy. So, what is it you're trying to achieve? What's the data that you need to collect? What data do you actually have? What mechanisms do you have to collect that data? What do you need to think about around risks, and kind of, you know, any governance around that data, who needs to be involved in that? How do you need to communicate that? So, all of those things, and if you've got that plan together, that will make it much easier for you to understand what you need to do next. So, you know, where are the gaps in the data? What, you know, what tools do we need? And you can start to then really think that through, and then also overlaying, well, what skills do we need to enable us to do this effectively? So, sit down and do that planning. Just take a bit of an audit around what you're doing around data and what you have, you know, before you start kind of ploughing in and acting. And I think that that's that what we, we constantly say to organizations is think, plan, then do.\nNC: Excellent. Well, thoughtful point to end on. Let me just thank our guests this month, that was Katie Nightingale from Grant Thornton and thanks to the CIPD's Hayfa Mohdzaini. On the technical side, some might just like to follow up some of these ideas with a listen back to one of our earlier podcasts, number 183, Building Inclusion with Computers. You can find that and all of our past editions on the CIPD podcast page on the website, and lots of CIPD information on this topic too.

But what are some of the other factors that prevent work from being ‘good’?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Marek Zemanik, Senior Public Policy Adviser, UK Nations at CIPD and Aysha Al Marri, UAE National Talent and Development at Etihad Airport Services L.L.C, as we unpack the barriers to ‘good work’ and how you can overcome them.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:28:30\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Too many workplace conflicts, staff saying managers don't listen to how to discover and remove barriers to good work. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWe're trying to think about what makes a good work and at first it seems pretty obvious, i mean make jobs fulfilling, and as autonomous and as well paid as you can, and then people should stay loyal, and productivity will rise. You can't imagine setting out to offer pressured, poorly organised and badly managed jobs, but well I suppose employers never learn. If people keep quitting or taking inordinate amounts of time off sick with stress, it has to be a sign that something is lacking in job quality and your organisation. Luckily CIPD's continuing research into people's experience of work can pinpoint many of these barriers so you can hopefully start knocking them down. Joining us to talk about good work and what gets in the way, with firstly a talented development manager with over a decade of experience in the fast moving and pressured airports operation industry, she's with Etihad Airport services, its Aysha Al Marri from the United Arab Emirates. Welcome!\nAysha Al Marri: Thank you.\nNC: And from the home team an advisor with a close focus on fair work, skills and productivity, he spent almost a decade advising ministers and civil servants in the Scottish government and now leads CIPD public policy work in the UK nations, its Marek Zemanik.\nMarek Zemanik: Hi, Nigel.\nNC: So, before we get stuck into those hurdles to great work, i just would like to ask both of you, what does a good job look like, Marek?\nMZ: Well, I think this is a great question actually, it probably is the first barrier to overcome when we think about how to improve jobs, it's to improve the understanding of what good work actually looks like, because I think, I mean even thinking back at my time before the CIPD, if you ask me what is a good job i would probably think, you know, pay package, reward package, benefits package, probably job security i would think about. I think the pandemic probably increased our understanding of the importance of work-life balance and flexible working etc. But there's other things there as well. And you mentioned actually some of them in your opening remarks, like job autonomy, job complexity, the meaningfulness of work as well, and also things like effective employee voice increasingly I think clear, that's one of the dimensions that underpins all the other elements of job quality as well. So, I think improving our understanding of all the various dimensions of jobs and of course the inequalities and the trade-offs that we make between those job quality dimensions I think is absolutely crucial. So, yeah, lots of different dimensions I think, the seven dimensions of job quality that the CIPD conceptualise are incredibly useful and helpful and widely used, and spreading awareness of that should be key.\nNC: Excellent. Well, we'll go into some of those barriers in a bit more detail in a moment but just broadly, Aysha, what's your concept of good work?\nAM: Nigel, good work to me is having a clear direction, the environment of the place that I'll be working with. Also, Marek mentioned about the pay, it's all compiled together, one another can make the good work for me better, especially if the leadership is really looking after their employees and their employees have a voice which can make the difference in a good work.\nNC: Do you think you should expect to be happy all the time at work, for example?\nAM: Let's be realistic, being happy all the time is not an option as a human, we sometimes we are happy sometimes we are not happy, but if you see all the lets say all the good aspects that you need or anybody need at work to make you happy, why not? So, we need to separate our personal from the work to make ourself happy because when you always have something to be busy with, you should be happy.\nNC: Okay. Now Marek, in your latest CIPD good work index, you were hit immediately on one particular barrier and that is conflict at work did come up quite often. I mean, just elaborate on that a bit, I mean, we're talking about conflict. Is this always between workers and managers, and what are the wider implications if you don't address these conflicts?\nMZ: Yeah, so we focused on conflict in this year's good work index because its questions we asked in the past and we didn't for a while and we wanted to see if there's a difference over the years, but also i think the evidence that we have uncovered shows the real impact experiencing conflict has on the individuals, on their wellbeing, on their job satisfaction, but also of course then linked to other outcomes including their performance for example, as well. So, overall, we found 25% of employees experienced some type of conflict. Now, that can be lots of different things. That can be things like being undermined or humiliated in your job, it can be verbal abuse, it can be a lot more serious things like discrimination based on your protected characteristics, of course physical assault, sexual assault very uncommon but they did come.\nNC: if I just stop you there for a moment, you're talking about these protected characteristics, you're talking about people where it's been more likely that they've experienced problems because of their situation?\nMZ: Yes, I mean it falls logically that people with protected characteristics are more likely to experience this type of conflict and we see that in sort of overall differences as well, women more likely to report that they've experienced conflicts, disabled people more likely that they've experienced conflict. The question then is what is the impact this is having, how are employees dealing with it and most importantly what can you do to try and prevent it. And I'll start with the last one i think, and that's probably because there's three dimensions there and all of them are linked to sort of our understanding of job quality in general. Number one its line managers, line management quality, training line managers\nNC: OK. Well, let's ask Aysha how she deals with some of those things, I suppose where there is conflict, you need to know first if it's specific to a particular difficult relationship, a kind of a one off, or whether it's kind of baked into your way of working. So, can you just sort of talk about some of the actions you might take where you see there is conflict, which is getting in the way of productivity, for example.\nAM: So, I'm giving you an example of from our organisation. For example, if there is a conflict then it should be raised to the line manager immediately, then the line manager with the Representer of HR sit with the each one separately and then sit together to put everything on the table to be transparent and then to find where, is the solution or where is the issue in this conflict. Then this is the way that we build on, on our organisational, cultural that open conversations, speak to each other, find the problem, then find the solution. This is the only way that we can go further. The leadership are taking a great measure on this as they always ask for, let's say for a monthly meeting with the direct reports. They follow up is also a key from my experience, the follow up from the leadership to the direct reports is key, so whenever we ask the line managers have you done the collaborations, have you done one to one with your employee, you know everybody should be prepared with that data. So, it's clear it's like a cultural that we built.\nNC: I want to go back to the issue of sort of handling the senior managers in a moment with you Aysha, but before we do that, I can see that if there isn't proper training Marek, we can get into trouble here. Let's say you decide to address work quality issues for people. It starts with a conversation, say, involving a, a senior, or a line manager. Many may feel the need immediately to be rather defensive to respond, to justify, you know, the status quo, things they can't or won't fix, and that can make things worse. Because, I mean, if a team member thinks something is a barrier to them having a good job, then then it is, isn't it?\nMZ: Look, I mean, ultimately it has to be, it has to be a conversation, right? I mean, it has to be a conversation between the manager and the employee. And, you know, I think going into a conversation thinking it's your way or the highway on either side, by the way, it's, it's surely not conducive to try to sort out any issues. And I mean, there's so many different aspects of job quality, where there has to be a bit of give and take I think by employees and by employers as well. I mean the probably the most obvious example here is homeworking, right, we've seen a huge shift and there's been some moves to try and bring employees back to offices to a certain number of days per week for example. I think the way to do these things is to speak to each other, explain personal circumstances, explain the reasons for that particular approach, and see if there's a way of finding some sort of a middle ground and the vast majority of cases there is a middle ground to be found.\nNC: What? What if there isn't middle ground, Aysha? I was thinking of an example perhaps where a manager doesn't want to be told how to run the place. They maybe don't think they should be put on a programme, for example.\nAM: So, if the line manager feels that he can't handle this conversation, he always will be referred to his line manager or to the HR to gain a support and have the training to handle these kind of cases because it's a, it's a bit of sensitive and you need to know how to deal with these kind of conversations. And just adding to Marek about the COVID. A great example happens to us here from our region we actually never been introduced to work from home unless we have the COVID, then suddenly everybody's been working from home, and we start to see conflicts between us as a team. Our manager just decided that we will have a meeting in the morning and meeting in the afternoon and teams, so we all can get on the same page, and this shows like 100% of alignment of the team, which can show you how the communications is really effective in this case.\nNC: Hmm, well, it's a very good point and I think it's come up several times on this podcast that it's quite valuable for managers maybe to change their style, to devolve responsibility for different things so that you don't have one person trying to sort of lead a team in an autocratic way online. Responsibility can be shared around a bit more. Marek, this leads us on to the fairly obvious conclusion that good jobs are those where I mean, whether it's in a conflict with a manager or any other situation, the employee feels they have a voice. Employee voice is a term that's sort of banded around a lot. And of course it can be informal or it can be formal with the sort of meetings that Aysha has just described, just tell us how that fits into the sort of good job picture.\nMZ: I mean, I think feeling like you're being hurt is one part of it and then feeling like you are able to affect change is another thing. I think both of those extremely important. Now you're right. There's many different types of voice channels, quite formal ones, collective voice channels, trade unions, for example, but also individual voice channels, which is just your meetings with your manager, for example, on a one-to-one basis. The thing that has struck me from the first time I looked at these numbers five years ago when I joined the organisation, the first time I saw the numbers around the voice, I was quite shocked because consistently, you've got about a fifth of all employees across the UK who say they have no voice channels whatsoever. A fifth! And that includes one-to-one meetings with managers. That includes team meetings as well. Remember that all this, this is people excluded from the numbers who are sole traders who don't have manners, etcetera. So, these are people who should have access to voice channels, but they don't. And it's such an easy fix as well, you know, to try and put in place at least you know some sort of a formal meeting once a week with your employees. But still this has not changed over the years that we've been doing this research. It has simply not shifted despite its importance.\nNC: But of course, for employee voice to be powerful, managers do need to respond to what people say, Aysha, and that can be more difficult in a pressured organisation.\nAM: Yeah, that's for sure. If the employee don't feel that he has a voice, then this is the real problem, you know. He will just lost the trust of the company. So, the line manager need to act smartly to see where he can fit the need of or the voice of the employee. For example, doing a survey to listen from the employee. If they are engaged, if they are unhappy, what suggestions they can bringing up something with this concept having huddles with the employee, like monthly huddles like we do here we have monthly huddles where employee can have free voice like to raise their all concerns and these concerns will be written down to be answered by the leadership and then afterwards they will study it and then they will see how can they adjust and implement some of these within the organisational capacity to apply.\nNC: And Aysha, would you say your region is strong on employee engagement in general?\nAM: I would say that as we have more than 300 nationalities. We have different events that always allowing the employee to interact. For example, recently we having the diversity day, you know, everybody's showing case their own country. This makes you feel so proud of your country, even though we are learning about each other cultural and each others let's say food because they are sharing some food from their own backgrounds. So, I feel the engagement in my region is really strong as it is a part of the cultural even, in, in our cultural we always gather, we always speak, so it's also accepting our organisation on that.\nNC: Well, that's good to hear. And of course, there are a lot of different ways of engaging with people Marek, and I guess you see a lot of well diversity for lack of a better word across the organisations that you follow in your research.\nMZ: I mean, I think this is, I don't want to just keep bringing this back to home-working because I think one of the mistakes we've made over the last few years is just to sort of keep talking about home-working, forgetting about, you know, the let's say 45% of all workers who can't work from home, but homeworking has certainly meant challenges when it comes to communication. When it comes to, let's say, a sense of team spirit, a sense of, you know, shared values. And it is one of the things that does come up in research in this case in the Scottish report that I wrote that home-workers tend to report slightly poorer relationships with their colleagues than those who do not work from home. So, I think it's probably even more important to try and you know, find ways of engaging with each other on a social basis as well, and make sure you don't just sit on teams calls on a daily basis talking about work, but you, you know, you put extra effort into, you know, a bit of fun as well, getting to know each other on a personal level as well.\nNC: Well, we're talking about different barriers to good work Aysha, one which is a problem for many people, is technology in its many forms, and now, I mean, it's such a massive subject and I can't just blandly sort of throw them together, but how large do you think technology looms as a sort of barrier to job satisfaction and what have you done when you're sort of bringing in a new platform or trying something new, how do you ensure that it isn't frustrating people in their job?\nAM: So, I'll just give you one example that we had to implement a system for a disciplinary where everybody felt like they are unconfident to do it. So, what we have done, we have done several sessions of training for the line managers on how to use it, in additional to that we have also implemented some 'how to do' videos to help the visual people to understand how to use it, even though we were having like opening a door of the office for like one month for anybody to just come in and see a trial, how to do it and in reality. And afterwards we can see that everybody comes down and like it and they start to commend that, OK what about changing the next, what is the next system that we can use? So, they see then the benefits, but of course after the training, after the sessions after all this like it took time for them to be feeling comfortable to use technology.\nMZ: I think it's important to realise that just like people have different work preferences, so they, you know, some people prefer working in one way or another, people also have different learning preferences as well and for some, they would much rather go into an office and take part in a training session, be able to try it out themselves, for example, learn from peers, others, me for example, right, I would much rather sit at home and try it myself and do some sort of a webinar situation. And I think when it comes to the adoption of technology, it's important to recognise that people are not the same when it comes to learning. Now we did actually ask in the good work index this year as well about people's learning. One of the options that they could select was whether they had any sort of training on AI and sort of emerging digital technologies. The percentage was 2%, so it is sort of still I think, I wouldn't say in its infancy, but I think I think we're still a bit slow in trying to adopt it. I think the fundamental problem is there is still a huge amount of uncertainty around it. I think people have you know have not used it enough to be able to see its benefits, and I would encourage anybody who's listening to actually go and try one of the AI tools because it is mind blowing and it can help you in your job immensely.\nNC: Well, in fact, we have a whole podcast, two or three back I think where we talked about particularly AI and learning development, so there's a lot of useful information for people there. Marek, how can you kind of measure and test the quality of the jobs that you offer before some of these barriers emerge?\nMZ: I think step one, as I mentioned in the sort of first thing that I said is understanding what the different elements of job quality are. In an ideal scenario you would understand it, explore it and try and perhaps speak to your employees about it as well, do some surveys and try and ideally compare yourself against competitors, right? I mean, there's lots of surveys organisations, we were especially large organisations that tend to measure quite a lot of metrics but very rarely do we look at quite sort of fundamentals of job design because you just think right, job design is that's what the job is and that's what it is, right? But sometimes it is just a matter of, you know, having a little think, right? What if we allowed this employee a little bit more initiative and allow them get a little bit more job autonomy to try and do that, for example. And well, who knows? You might actually be surprised that you'll find improvements in performance and productivity from that employee just because they were given a little bit more job autonomy. So, I think understanding it. Perhaps figuring out where some of the biggest gaps are. I think our good work index, even though it's a, you know, it's a big report based on the UK by survey, but it does show some of the clear inequalities between different groups of employees, but also between different occupations and industries, differences by employer size, for example. So, if you can see yourself in that, you probably already have a good idea of where some of the biggest gaps might be. Skill development, career advancement, career progression, for example, some of the low, lower paid occupations struggle in that particularly badly. Yeah, I guess understanding it is step one.\nNC: Aysha, taking responsibility for improving job quality, it's another job for HR, isn't it already doing so much? Do you think that it is the responsibility of people, professionals or they're being stretched too thin already?\nAM: At the responsibilities of leadership and of HR, it's really huge. However, we are trying our best, especially to measure what we have done already with the conducting some surveys during the year, trying to get some feedback, offering some kind, sort of development where it need from the organisation perspective. We get this from the line manager. We work on them, then we create some programmes even for to just develop people and where they think they need these developments. It is a responsibility and we are keen to understand what is the gap? How we, can fit on there? We always offer our support to the business in any case of the employee development.\nMZ: I just don't think it should be seen as an additional responsibility. I just think this is what we do. This is what HR does. This is what people professionals do. I mean recruitment and retention, that's all done through creating good jobs and that's why our organisations purpose is to champion work and working lives, better working lives. It is simply part and parcel of working in HR, trying to make sure that employees have the best possible jobs and they can, we can get the best out of them in terms of performance.\nNC: Makes sense. So, to bring this to some kind of conclusion with both of you, I mean, we're in a world where as we discussed in detail on last month's podcast, ever more workers see their jobs as transactional. You know, there's risk that they're just doing it for the money and they're not so committed. I mean drawing on some of the things we've said already during the discussion, what are the priorities then in ensuring people stay committed, happy and productive doing good work then, Aysha?\nAM: First of all, you can see the attendance of the employee. It can show you a lot. The commitment of the employees. Coming, setting initiative. You can see from the environment or from the cultural everybody is greeting everybody, talking to each other. For example, we have finance and HR and we all know that they are very close to each other, but they don't actually communicate. They always use like emails, any sort of communication which we always encourage, to forget about e-mail. Go to the person, greet him, open a topic, open a conversation. This is how we started this in our teams between finance and HR and it's really very well working. We can see they are sitting in meetings together. They are talking the same language, even though it's finance and HR. So, we see all of this, plus we have the organisational health survey that we conduct yearly to see how we can prioritise our employees good work.\nNC: Banning emails. What a good idea. And Marek?\nMZ: I think there's, I mean there's obviously quite a few things, but I think the values of an organisation are incredibly important. I think, to sort of feel that you are in some sort of meaningful job, you agree with the values of the organisation, the purpose of the organisation that you, that you and doesn't matter what sector this is actually because you can, you can always, I think articulate those values to improve levels of engagement. I think that's very important. I think that's where senior leaders have a really crucial role to play. And then, yeah, we've spoken about line management quite a few times. I mean the old idiom of people don't leave bad jobs, they leave bad managers. I think I think it's just absolutely correct.\nSo, for us as people professionals to make sure that managers have enough training, but also crucially enough time to manage their staff well. Have these conversations quite openly, quite honestly, feel make sure that employees feel that they are listened to. I think that's just so, so important. And then, you know, looking at all the other elements of job quality. You know, some people trade off elements of job quality for others. You know, the most obvious example being, for example, going for a job that's much better paid but has a much higher workload, right? So that's a sort of trade off that people will make, they trade off some work life balance for better pay, right? But understanding that are things that you can do for all employees to improve their job quality experience and there are skills that open up opportunities, career progression. You know there are sectors where career progression is virtually non-existent, you know flat. But the steps can be taken to try and make it a bit more stratified and show people these sort of paths through the organisation and that's what makes people feel a bit more committed to the organisation as well as seeing that there's some sort of future.\nNC: Well, thank you for that. I think you've both done extremely well in talking in some detail about the nature of good work and some of those barriers and the things that can be done to bring them down. So, a big thank you to Marek Zemanik who leads CIPD public policy work in the UK nations. And a big thank you to Aysha Al Marri, Talent and development manager with Etihad Airport services in the United Arab Emirates. Just still on the same theme, I can't finish without a quick shout out to our podcast listener Emily M, Who handles a product marketing for Finn Qi. She posted the result of listening to our June episode about our growing transactional attitudes to work, she thinks today's managers must advocate for employee autonomy. Talking about that today, step back and ensure staff have the training, resources and mentoring to succeed. She also says she's going to consider how each of her daily tasks contributes to her personal goals and career before just ticking off items on her To Do List. Until next time from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us at CIPD.

While it could be argued that there is nothing wrong with employees taking a transactional view of work – it may after all be a way of them self-determining healthy boundaries – disengagement with the organisation may be a concern.\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Jake Young, Senior Policy and Practice Advisor at CIPD and Garin Rouch, Consultant at Distinction, as we explore how a refreshed organisational development approach can help get that balance right.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 33:06\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: With more seeing their jobs as just a way or making money and easing back on commitment can you redesign work to remotivate people? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast. Let's face it most employers will take as much dedication as we're prepared to give but they don't always get it. CIPD research suggests that post Covid work is becoming less central to our lives. Going above and beyond is no longer seen as a duty in exchange for a salary. Your boss may be a hugger but work isn't family. Employees might just call it getting a better work life balance but for employers though it may be time to rethink job roles and expectations if they want people to reconnect. So our mission with our guests this month is to explore how an organisational development and design approach might help here. But before we meet them let's just listen to actor Ron Livingstone. Here he is playing a demotivated company employee in the movie Office Space and unlike most workers he doesn't even try to hide his feelings when meeting his bosses. [plays extract from film]. Well, as that comedy film neatly illustrates if people don't find their work rewarding and actually benefit from the extra effort they put in well, there may be trouble ahead. It's time for a rethink. Joining me now a consultant with long experience of helping organisations to bridge their performance gap he's also coacher of the CIPD in Central London it's Garin Rouch from Distinction Consulting. Hello.\nGavin Rouch: Hi. Thank you very much for having me.\nNC: With him a CIPD research advisor who has amassed a lot of evidence around employee engagement and leads for the CIPD on the annual Good Work Index it's Jake Young. Hi, Jake.\nJake Young: Morning Nigel.\nNC: So Jake I'll start with you. To what extent are you picking up on this rather transactional view at work that seems to be coming through?\nJY: Yeah. So work centrality is something we've explored since the Good Word Index began in 2018. So the Good Work Index is our annual benchmark of job quality in the UK and we've looked at to what extent people see work as central within their lives. So couple of things in particular we've looked at firstly at the kind of perception of whether work is purely transactional. So whether it's just for the money and this feeling has been slowly rising. It peaked last year in 2023 and it's peaking actually again in 2024 with half of our sample feeling the work is simply for the money. And then alongside that we look at how willing people are to work harder than they need to in order to help their organisation. Again, changes are pretty small but this has hit a low in the last couple of years. So again, we've got around 50% of people who are willing to go the extra mile for their organisation. So there is a clear trend that is going on over the years and initially this might feel like quite a negative finding, I suppose. But actually, if we kind of think about work centrality on its own it's not necessarily a negative thing.\nSo for most viewing work is just a part of their overall lives. You know it's more significant for some people and less for others can be a really good way to create a healthy balance between their work life and their home life and to swich off outside of their work into protect their mental and physical health. But things do get a little bit more complicated when we start to look at things like employee engagement and the kind of meaning that people get from their work. So we do in the Good Work Index we do find that people are pretty engaged when it comes to work. So they have pretty good levels of enthusiasm, they're emersed at work. Feelings of boredom, exhaustion are pretty comparatively pretty low. And this is really good.\nYou know we've found from other research that more engaged, more motivated staff are more likely to perform better. They're more likely to be more satisfied. Less likely to want to leave their jobs. However, and I'll let Garin jump in at some point shortly. I shouldn't be too much longer. When we look at meaningful work things can become a little bit more troublesome. So we see that people tend to gain meaning at work from their contribution to their organisation. So they perceive their work as useful, valuable and important for their employers. But unfortunately, employers feel less positively about the impact of their work beyond this. So they're less likely to feel that their work makes a positive difference to society. And they're also less likely to experience higher levels of kind of internal intrinsic validation from their work, such as feeling inspired by either their own jobs or the purpose of their organisation.\nSo this does potentially pose a risk for employers and people professionals. So if people are identifying less with their organisation and see work as less central is it possible that their levels of engagement, commitment, motivation all those things could also slip. And then if we combine this with the fact that work is shown to have pretty mixed effects on people's mental health this again, could cause a risk of unfulfilled and uninspired workers.\nNC: Yeah, that's great - you put a lot out there and given us a very good overview of all that. Let's for the moment park this issue of how you may be leaning to go with this rather more transactional approach because of social factors and all kinds of other things. But Garin Rouch in your work are you seeing this trend? Because this idea of people saying, look, I'm not paid to do that. This is it's quite you because traditionally people have close friends at work. They perhaps meet a partner there, you make connections. You get your skills for your future career. It's suddenly almost as if none of this matters. That work has no purpose beyond the salary.\nGR: Yeah. I think it's a really positive thing that the CIPD are starting this debate, it's a debate that needs to be had in organisations and as Jake is really opening up there it's multifaceted. So if we sort of look at within organisations. You now organisations are the micro causing of our society. You know it's technologies our work practices all different things coming together in their messy glory. And I guess it depends where you sort of start looking at this. So the transitioning employment. Re-engineering in the 90s started to undo some of the loyalty that people had towards their organisations. Organisations to a great extent failed to put boundaries around people's workloads and to a certain extend our employees - if you're not going to do this for me and we're going to have cosmetic wellbeing, maybe it's time I need to protect myself.\nSo I guess the question you know when we go into organisations to what extent is this a conscious decision on behalf of employees? Are they consciously withdrawing their labour and saying, right, that's it. To protect my identity, I need to have other interests and I can't be defined by work. Or is this a defensive reaction because of the way in which organisations are being run. This is the only way I can literally protect myself from the relentless nature of change and growth that's not necessarily linked to operational reality all those things as well. So I guess the mantra of organisational development is it depends. So it is really there is a lot of things that are actually going on within an organisation that is a huge impact. And all those wonderful things that add up to our culture can have a huge impact in terms of what does this transactional work look like in this organisation? And is it a bad thing?\nJY: Garin is talking about different societal changes that kind of impact how people feel in the workplace. And I would say that the fact that this feeling appears to have grown since the pandemic is definitely no coincidence.  I think it's quite easy to underestimate the impact that living in a really, kind of, uncertain state where you know people's lives were at risk, people were fearful of various things. For the best part of two / three years had had on us both in our personal lives and in our working lives. So I think during that time people kind of had the opportunity to reconsider their priorities in life. So I guess it's a kind of one simple way of putting it might be that people simply their priorities have simply shifted and they felt that you know I have other things to consider in my life now. As a result of such upheaval.\nNC: Okay. So Garin, take this on for us. So engagement is dropping, performances of some team members whether or not they're working remotely are rather doing the minimum so problems amounting. As on OD practitioner how do you discover whether there is this disengagement and whether it's a problem and then start thinking about what you can do to change the nature of the jobs to re-engage people?\nGR: Yeah, absolutely. Looking at it through an OD approach it's important to look it through different lenses. The concern when you have data like this comes out is that we just don't understand enough about the data. So sometimes data like this is a bit of a lag indicator. It's like a build-up of things that have happened over time and they contributed to this as well. So the other concern is that when you get data like this we start to pathologize the individual. What's wrong with the individual? Why are they starting to work in this transactional way that's - is it impacting outputs and outcomes and productivity? If you look at a plant and it doesn't grow we generally look at the system. You know where do we plant it; how much water did we give it? The temperature. But if we think about things like this then we start to go what's wrong with the individual. Maybe there is something wrong with them. So it's really important when you look at it from an organisational development perspective and look at it from a systems perspective which is how are the different factors contributing to it as well.\nSo if you think about it you know what is the order doing? What is it about them, you know, not scrutinising the ambitious targets that are given to them by senior leaders and saying, actually, does your resources actually match up to this? Are you stretching them too far? You know the senior managers that feel they have to deliver on these promises that have been made. There are managers that aren't pushing back on decisions and actually putting this pressure onto their front-line staff. And then you've got frontline staff that are maybe practicing what's the term? Structured antagonism. Such as purposeful silence where they actually, you know, what it doesn't matter if I don't say anything. So I'm just going to be quiet and I'm just going to withdraw my labour. So it's really important that we look around what are the factors that are influencing it and making sure that we're all taking our part of the responsibility here as well.\nNC: Now, I know as long ago as 1980 job roles were kind of split up into core characteristics. You know jobs needed to be motivating. You needed skill variety, task identity significant, autonomy and feedback. Jake, I just wondered whether that traditional way of kind of deconstructing a job and making sure it has the elements that keep people engaged. Is that still useful?\nJY: In short I think it is. I think motivation is quite a complex topic and construct because it's a really well researched area. And there is so many, kind of, different theories that have been used over the years. But what I would say is that quite a lot of these theories are either outdated or widely discredited by the kind of body of evidence by scientific research. So for example there are two theories that have really persisted over the years. The Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Motivational Hygiene Theory and these are no longer backed by any solid evidence. And actually, I did have a look at the Hackman and Oldham Job Characteristics Model and this is actually another outdated theory. However, there are some elements of it that still remain in our importance. So it is supported by some really solid evidence but the downside of it is that it fails to consider different context such as working in teams. So aspects of this have been included in a theory that's called Self Determination Theory of Motivation. So this is a newer theory that is actually really well evidenced. And this basically says that we have three psychological needs. That when fulfilled enable us to kind of grow psychologically and enjoy better wellbeing.\nSo these are autonomy so that's kind of having freedom of choice, freedom of choice in kind of how we work. Competence is another and that's kind of having mastery of our work. And then relatedness which is having connection and belonging with the people that we work with. And there are some other really solid evidence-based theories out there which include some of those aspects that you mentioned. So for example feedback is really important as a basis of improvement. Autonomy as I said. I don't think you can really overstate how important autonomy is. I think in this whole conversation empowering employees to kind of describe the ways in which to do their jobs is really important here too. You know improved engagement, improved motivation. Other factors include things like goal setting. So using smarter goals and then finally developing psychological safety. So this is basically ensuring group members feel safe to take risks and speak up without fear of judgment or rejection.\nSo I would say to kind of yeah, long answer short I think there are definitely some aspects which are really important in terms of building people's motivation. But I think it's important if we look at from my kind of perspective looking at the evidence there are some theories that kind of need to be questioned.\nNC: Okay. So moving some of these ideas through the organisational development and design process Garin, just take us on how do you build these in to creating a kind of working within teams, within organisations which is likely to make people feel a bit happier about their work and more engaged and go the extra mile again?\nGR: Building on Jake's point the thing about autonomy and by definition ownership as well - I think that's a key area. You know if someone is working transactionally how do you start to rebuild that relationship? How do you sort of put the breadcrumbs down to lead them back into full engagement, as well? So there is that saying no-one washes a rental car. So how do you actually start to create that sense of ownership in an organisation?\nSo I guess some of the ways we do it. And you talked about design at the beginning of the programme and we have to be intentional in the way in which we design organisations. And often the people doing the designing don't necessarily have access to the same theories and research that Jake has and that's a real firewall that's getting in the way here. Like all this great research is out in the academic field isn't finding its way into the hands of managers and HR teams so that evidence approach is really important. So part of that design and it's not necessarily about moving the organisation chart around it's really thinking about how do we create autonomy and that's and it's often the delegation of power and decision making rights within an organisation and job crafting and giving people independence to do that. But that requires a real sophistication on the part of managers and there is some really scary statistics out there in terms of management capability at the moment.\nOften we all hear about the good practices but on average a manager I think it's called YouGov (?) waits ten years before it receives any intensive leadership development. And I think it's 51% managers are overloaded by 51% in terms of capacity of workload. So if we want them to take on a more sophisticated way of working with their teams we've got to support them. The big thing is okay we're going to make them more autonomous. Well, they don't have the reps. And so, you say be autonomous and then people don't take up the invitation and as a result they then disappointed and take the power back.\nA nice kind of metaphor to think about how you sort of delegate decision making rights and power in organisation is almost like an irrigation system. So it's kind of thinking of it as water going down through the pipes and making sure that all of the power is given to all of the different places in the organisation where it actually needs to be situated. So power and decision making are situated in the right place. But the challenges that you get are often quite tough because senior managers can be quite territorial. They don't necessarily want decision to be in certain places as well. So we have to be realistic and pragmatic in terms of how we go about doing it. But again. Remote work has been a big driver behind this I would hypothesise. And some of the research that we're seeing is that traditional hierarchical, power driven, charismatic, management doesn't work as well. And things such as shared leadership works better where leadership is led on a particular task based on experience capability and capacity as well. So there is lots of different approaches. I'm going to go back to it depends for each organisation.\nNC: Okay. We'll let you say that once more.\nGR: Thank you.\nNC: Jake Young I mean all this is about employment engagement and that in itself I'm going to term it's been a big thing since the 1990s and everything from sort of rewards, you know big stuff like health insurance to free tickets to shows, career pathways, sales leaderboards liked or loathed by people depending on their jobs perhaps. Is there much evidence out there on the whole panoply of employee engagement whether that is a way of getting people engaged again?\nJY: So we did a big review of employee engagement kind of looking what it is, how it can be measured - what kind of factors influence it. What kind of outcomes does it have? In terms of those sort of tactics that you mention I don't know if there is a great deal of evidence but there are a number of factors that we found can predict engmagnet. So Garin was mentioning job - you mentioned organisational design but job design as well I think is really important.\nSo one thing particularly is called the Job Demands Resources Model and so that's basically balancing the demands people face in their jobs and the resources that they have. So ensuring employees don't feel kind of overwhelmed or overworked in their jobs and then providing them with the resources to perform effectively such as line manager and colleague support. Really quality feedback and again, autonomy to try and control their work environment. Those things are really important. Also, people management skills as well. Managers need to kind of foster engmagnet among their staff and Garin mentioned different types of leadership. Especially in a kind of transformative leadership way. So this means kind of inspiring them towards a goal or a vision that's found to be particularly effective to improve engagement. But that's not only on the part of managers they need themselves to feel empowered through things like training to actually kind of conduct this sort of people management authentically and effectively.\nAnd then you mention interventions as well. I just wanted to touch on there is a kind of small body of evidence for things like mindfulness techniques. Other things like that that may help improvement engagement but I should say that the evidence if kind of fairly primitive on those kind of technique.\nNC: I was going to say it depends on the individual, doesn't it? Because I'm feeling hostile already as soon as you said mindfulness.\nJY: Yeah.\nNC: But that is not universal. Work can be stressful and different things work for different people. I just want to take up something you said earlier with Garin and that is the fact that on the one hand this is where people sort of clawing back different work life balance. And that it might be a good thing. If you talk about a transactional relationship I mean I work freelance in the main. And I really strive to do a good job for the people I work with and I would sort of slightly argue that commitment is a transaction. The fact that there is a transaction involved might actually mean people do a really good job. I mean contractors are not all awful and sustain many organisations.\nGR: Absolutely. If you look at it from an identity perspective what happens basically is that when things go wrong at work if work is so central to your life then it has an enormous impact on you. It becomes more difficult to draw boundaries around hours and that as well. Whereas often contractors will have a healthier balance in terms of how they approach work. It's really focused time often they will be balancing the needs of different clients at the same time too as well. So it is that kind of real focus that they can actually have and making sure that things stay within perspective. I guess the other things that contractors can have that others don't have is that they can leave the building at the end of the day and they don't feel like they need to go back in. Whereas, if those internal relationships are really difficult you know if they're feeling that they don't have a voice in an organisation then an employee can often feel quite trapped.\nNC: So Jake, supposing an organisation is done some of the things which Garin has suggested how can you kind of tell that people are starting to re-engage again? Is it work measuring?\nJY: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I would say 100%. I think there is some fairly clear measures. Some well used measures that you can use to think about engagement. So engagement itself is quite an interesting concept because in our research on it we distinguished between employee engagement which is a kind of broader term under which sit things like commitment, identification with the organisation and motivation. And then work engagement which is more specific. And in order to measure work engagement the clear dominant scale is called the UTREICHT Work Engagement Scale and this is one that we really recommend. It's commonly used it's really robust it's been around for years. It has different numbers of scales if you want to be more specific. Or kind of less detailed I suppose. So this kind of looks at the psychological state of engagement by asking about three keys areas and I think this kind of gets to your question. If you want to understand how engaged people are. So it's essentially looking at vigour towards work. Dedication towards work and absorption into work activity.\nSo I can give you an example at the kind of questions that people would answer. So the first one would be, at my work I feel bursting with energy. So that's measuring vigour. I'm enthusiastic about my job - dedication and I'm emersed in my work - absorption. So again, I don't want to go into too much detail into the scale but I think that's a really, kind of really robust, rigorous and quite straight forward way that organisations can easily administer to their staff and kind of get a sense of whether these interventions and practices are actually making much of a difference when it comes to engagement.\nGR: Yeah, and if I can just come in on that as well. Because the measures are really important but I'm not really sure that managers know what to do with the data. So often we do the events and say, who measures engagement? Great and then who does anything about it? Not many. So you know fundamentally I think sometimes we can overcomplicate things. You just need to ask them and you just need to involve them. And I think probably one of the most underestimated capabilities in modern contemporary organisations is the ability to facilitate and really open up spaces where people can actually feel like they can input and a change actually happens. So you know things where you start giving them safe spaces to ask questions about what's going on. To give them feedback. To help them feel informed where they're involved early and often in decision making. That's all these things are absolutely critical.\nSo one thing that we do regularly building on the work of Professor Julie Hodges is a change readiness assessment. So what we do is we use it as a dialogue. We do quite a lot of dialogues you can change. And that's where before they do a change we actually go in and ask them how ready are you before we take this new strategic direction? Do you buy into it? Do you think that the benefits outweigh the pain that's going to come with this? And all those kind of things can really start to help people feel involved and a sense of ownership and a sense of inclusion and just the act of talking - I think sometimes that can be a little bit lost and it is difficult when you have organisations of a certain size. But you can facilitate it in a way that people can feel involved or at least feel represented as well. I think the research is incredibly useful because it starts to give us clues about what the problems might be. But Kurt Lewin says we never understand a system until we change it.\nSo if we go for wholescale change it's an enormous amount of risk and resource that goes into it. So we have a hypothesis we think that people are being transactional because of these particular reasons. So in organisations it's really beneficial often to do pilot groups or to experiment and therefore iterate as well. So and even in small organisations you can try a new way of work - you can try job crafting with a particular team and then compare and contrast with the performance against another team as well and what that does that allows you to get some insight into - okay, is this the thing and how are people responding to it and getting their feedback. And then you can really start to work on it as well.\nNC: Do you think you need to be a very large organisation?\nGR: No, you can be a small organisation and you can just try it with individual teams to see how they work with this and obviously you need their informed consent to make sure they feel happy with it. But it just gets an idea that okay, so these particular interventions are having this impact as well and I guess the other thing about OD is that you intervene at different levels. So it is that thing we intervene at different levels and we just see what the different reactions are. And we try just different ways of working. And going back to Jake's rigorous and robust way of working we measure it to the best of our ability. Both qualitatively and quantitatively. As well.\nNC: And of course, before making these changes Jake Young you need to talk to people because I hear so often people will have left the job without even explaining why they feel demotivated.\nJY: Yeah. Absolutely. As Garin said I think getting people involved at the earliest stage possible when you're bringing in interventions and kind of any organisational change is really important. I think that really helps kind of create those shared goals and just to get people's feedback throughout the whole process up and down the organisation. Yeah, I think that's really key to kind of bringing these changes.\nGR: Yeah - there was a fascinating story done by Paul Knott in 2002 and he said he liked decisions at strategic level over 20 years and they've just found that all the data shows that participative decision making out performs top down. So even if it's just not from a transactional perspective it's just from an actual output perspective as well. So I guess all of the things that we're sharing in terms of evidence based here don't just impact the world being an employee but they actually have a hard tangible outcome on the output of the organisation as well. And I this is not soft and fluffy stuff that we're talking about here. This is organisation performance at the highest level.\nNC: But particularly difficult Garin if an individual's values and goals in life are in conflict with the organisations. I mean that can happen, can't it? And that's quite difficult to resolve.\nGR: Yeah. It can and people with the organisations as well for different reasons as well. So you know Jake was talking earlier which was a really good point which is about our peer to peer relationships. So that's often that kind of sense of belonging. So you may not necessarily agree with the strategic direction and many people have to work to live. But if you have those bonds within your team and that's done by design and done intentionally then people can actually feel like a flourishing member of the team. They're making their contribution. It does make a difference and they do feel significant as well. So also, organisations you know they don't always espouse their values very clearly so it's not very easy to align yourselves with either anyway. Often the values that they talk about that sit on the wall behind the reception they're not the values. They're not the values. The values are actually something else.\nNC: There is a whole programme around that - where this leaves organisational goals and values. So we'll save that for another day. So bringing this together then so kind of final question really for both of you and that is that starting with Jake have we seen a fundamental shift in what organisations can reasonability expect out of people and what kind of work life balance people expect. In other words, can we work with where we are now or do we have to have a bit of give and take on both sides if the sort of work contract is to continue successfully?\nJY: I would say the evidence suggests that there has definitely been a shift. As I said people's needs and priorities appear to have shifted definitely accelerated by the pandemic I would say but as I said earlier and just to kind of wrap up I don't think lower work centrality or feeling like work is a more transactional relationship is necessarily a bad thing. I think it's more about prioritising the other aspects of job quality and making sure you kind of harness the potential of those I suppose. So trying to really keep people engaged. Allow employees flexibility and autonomy to control their work environment and then provide managers and leaders with training to kind of encourage and demonstrate and manage their staff to develop really strong supportive relationship. So kind of focusing on those things as opposed to worrying too much about the prospect of lower work centrality I would say is a positive way to go.\nNC: And maybe Garin organisations are going to have to work harder at convincing people of the real values to their lives and careers of what they can gain from the workplace.\nGR: Absolutely, yeah. But they need to make time to design by intention. Things like remote work have been approached in a really haphazard way in many ways and naturally so because it was a really involved situation so it was about how can we intentionally design organisations the way that we work? Engage our people in the process of actually designing it but also investing in the capability of our leaders to sort of manage in this more sophisticated way. But the word is investment. It's not a cost and I think sometimes that's a bit of confusion that's happened. The things that Jake was talking about the importance of L&D and the role that plays in engagement as well is huge. And that investment has to start with leaders as well.\nNC: Brilliant. Well, many thanks to both Garin Rouch from Distinction Consulting and Jake Young CIPD Research Advisor.

Is it finally time to consider HR's next top operating model? \nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Dave Ulrich, University of Michigan - Ross School of Business, Natalie Shiels, Chief People Officer at Mosaic Group, and Perry Timms, founder of People and Transformational HR, as we explore what approach to HR would be fit-for-purpose in the rapidly changing business environment of today and the future.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 34:02\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Is your HR set up fit for purpose and value for money or is it time to radically change your HR Operating Model? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast. Now people professionals don't need reminding how their working days, duties and responsibilities constantly change.  So it's kind of surprising that the human resource structures that determine who does what and who they report to haven't really changed much in 30 years. Take the original tried and tested Ulrich Operating Model it's the one that divided HR functions into strategic partners, administrative experts, employee champions and change agents. Because technology and employee needs, well, they change so much. Is it time to pick and mix from a welter of new HR models out there? Or can current models adapt and evolve to respond to all that pressure to be more agile and deliver better value. Well, we're delighted this month to welcome the man behind that original HR business partner model no less than top management guru and HR thinker Dave Ulrich. Welcome Dave and thanks for getting up so early to join us from Salt Lake City.\nDave Ulrich: Nigel, thank you. I'm delighted to join the conversation.\nNC: Our other two guests with a global HR strategist with a track record helping to optimise HR operating models while nurturing inclusive workforces. She's Natalie Sheils Chief People Officer at Mosaic Group which unites mobile first companies. Hello Natalie.\nNatalie Sheils: Hello, thank you for having me, Nigel.\nNC: And we are spoiling you this month because we got yet another influential industry thinker in our lineup. The founder of People and Transformational HR Perry Timms who works to adapt and reinvent teams he says from dreams to moonshots. Hello Perry.\nPerry Timms: Hello there, yeah, this is a moonshot for me. I am so pleased to be here. Thank you.\nNC: Okay. So Dave Ulrich let's start with you. If you are going to launch your model today what would it look like?\nDU: I've never called it my model ha. I've never said this is the Ulrich Model. I stole it from some companies who are doing great HR work. And it was in 1997 did a work called HR Champions and I was thinking back that's 27 years ago. 27 years ago, I don't think anything is much the same. Phones aren't the same, televisions aren't the same, cars aren't the same. The HR function has been through an evolving change and so it's always been prioritising change. So if I were starting today, today I would start with HR is not about HR. HR is about creating value in the marketplace. Not just strategic value inside the company but value for a customer, an investor and the community. And the agenda for HR is not about its operating model it's about the value that the HR services bring to the stakeholders of the company and that's where I start.\nI still see HR people going into a meeting with their executive team or their business team or their board and saying, here's our programme. And their programme could be culture change or hybrid work or leadership or whatever employee experience some of the great work Perry has done. I think that's not the place to start your discussion. I think today when HR people walk into that room the first couple of slides are, here's our customers. We say HR is about people. Yes when our customers are people. Here's our investors debt or equity or parent company. Here is the community. This is what we as a company are trying to accomplish in the marketplace. Then we'll talk about employer experience, leadership, culture etc.\nNC: I mean I absolutely get all that. But I mean you have to acknowledge though that there is a sense in which a lot of organisations are built on relatively traditional lines with those delineations btweeen strategic partners, the people who do the admin and the people who are brought in to make the changes all that.\nDU: Oh, no question. And some of the principles are timeless. It's interesting we did a summary of nine advisory firms who claim they have a new organisation design model. Not one is new. Here is what we find HR is composed of specialists who have deep expertise in compensation, training, learning, engagement. Deep expertise. And HR is comprised of people who apply that knowledge to a setting, it could be a business unit, it could be a function. Guess what those two groups have to work together that's the agenda that's timeless. HR has deep expertise and application of that expertise call it whatever you want to call it. Somebody said it's agility, agility has been around for 50 years. We've got to put those two pieces together and then the third piece we've got a whole bunch of administrative things that have got to be done. You've got to get paid; you've got to get trained. Today we have Gen NI and I hope we'll hear from Natalie about how technology is just doing that third thing.\nSo in any organisation in HR is a function you have specialists, deep experts, you have generalists who work in the field who apply that equity and you have administrative processes that make it work. Bringing those together is the challenge. Everybody loves to look at the HR operating model. In the last 25 years we've identified ten dimensions of an effective HR department. Which are reputation, which are purpose, what are your competencies, what are your analytics, what are your skills, what are your people, what are your etc. And then our commitment is to say which of those ten dimensions has the most impact on customers, investors, stakeholders. The HR Operating Model is not in the top five. What matters most is how well people work together and what the reputation is of the HR department so when we get into the HR Operating Model it's actually a by-product of relationships and reputation.\nNC: Well, Natalie, Dave has put an awful lot out there. But just to reiterate first things first if HR is under the cosh to offer better value we've already hard that word. What would you say is missing from the old models or maybe what could we dispense with?\nNS: The old model has - there is a lot of legitimacy as to why it continues to exist. You've got people who are expertise in terms of what they do. And then there is also the realities of how day to day work actually happens at work. Right, when you're sitting and you come in if I'm an Operations Manager I'm just focused on doing that. I'm focused on my people, I'm focused on what goals we have as a department and if there is anything I need I'm going to go to an HR team and I'm going to say, look, I need to know how many days my people have off. I need to know what this in compensation. I need to know what are we doing in terms of our employee engagement etc.\nAnd so, if HR model is going to be moving it needs to move lockstep in terms of how the rest of the organisation starts to become more advanced. Right? Starts to think in a way that I would say disruptive. And the technology kind of advancement what's happening now is actually forcing businesses to become that way. And so that's one of the pros and I'd say one of the reasons why we probably start looking at the HR Model now and really we should was probably kickstarted by covid. The covid undertones are very similar to what disruption is doing, our technological disruption. It's forcing us to come out of our silos and start to actually think, okay, as an HR how can we also start to actually impact the business in a way that's really, really, really strategic? And how do we get that seat at the table? We did but how do you hold onto it? And there is many ways that we can kind of think about how we do that.\nLooking at the old model, right, one of the things that is timeless about it is that the concept of strategic partner in with the businesses because it is kind of talking what Dave mentioned which is how do we become, how do we deliver value to the business as stakeholders, investors all of that? So that aspect continues to remain this is why you will see within every business there is a strategic business partner. But there is other things like admin that we have to start to look at in a different way and technology is forcing us to do that and helping us to do that.\nNC: Okay. So turning to Perry now. What do the leaders think is missing almost in the design of the HR? Are there the same things that you find you're building into the new models?\nPT: Hmm, yeah, it's really interesting hearing both those views because it takes me to the era that Dave started with the mid 1990s when I think it was about standardisation, replication and almost like instrumentality of work at the time. But I think work is very different now and we've just heard that from Dave and Natalie. So what leaders are saying is that temp and that framework is no longer relevant to mass personalisation and even things like exponential growth. It's not what we need but we don't know how to do that. And we don't know what the people function can do for us when it comes to things like recourse planning and strategic workforce planning and so on. So it's got a curiosity to it and it doesn't quite know how to expect from HR what it can deliver that helps it strategic muscle, I suppose, in a new arena. But what's really interesting is how people in the HR profession have interpreted Dave's model. Because I'm not really sure that the HR business partner was ever a role. I think it was more a space where business and the HR profession came together. And people in those roles were relationships brokers, they were coaches, they were consultants, they were people scientists. They were performance analysists. But we tried to package it in a role and I think that's HR doing the instrumental job design thing on itself and we've now created divisions instead of intersections.\nSo what business leaders say to me is, how can we rely on HR to help us deal with the completely and random circumstance when what we see in itself is silo thinking? So there is something about the incongruence of that. But I think we're now starting to see that experimentation that Natalie talked about. How we are stepping into more project orientation and the experimental things that we need because we have to, because we're facing things like artificial intelligence and automation becoming something so prevalent in administrative work. We've not done that before so therefore we have to experiment therefore we have to work across disciplines. I think that's forcing us out of our own self-imposed silos into something much more intersectional and something much more product and project orientated. So that's the kind of thing that I get asked to explain quite a bit. About why aren't we getting what we need from HR and I think part of it is because we've been so busy trying to fix new and standardisation and instrumentality we've got stuck in that and we need to unstick ourselves first and then help you do that. That's my take on it, Nigel.\nNC: So Dave, do you want to say anymore about we unstick ourselves then? To use the phrase again.\nDU: I don't think HR anymore is just strategic. Strategy for me is a mirror and in the mirror of strategy you reflect what you do. You hire, you train, you develop. I think now instead of a mirror you have a window. You look through the strategy to the outside customer. In Perry's world an employee experience and there is all kinds of words whatever you want to call it. Engagement, experience, wellbeing, flourishing. The correlation between employer experience and customer experience are generally point 6 to point 8. So my job in HR is not to deliver a strategy it's to create a customer experience because of my good employer experience and that customer experience then leads to investor. So when I sit within executive I'm not sitting there doing HR and saying I want to create 25% economic value for this company. And I love the idea, Perry, of division is less important than intersection.\nThat is so critical because we have ten dimensions of a great HR function the one that comes out the highest well, two reputation is relationships. How well do we work with each other? And we always used to solve that in a governance way, Nigel. With everybody's done RACI responsible, accountable. And we've all done RACI. I've been married a long time. Not once in our decades of our marriage have my wife and I sat down on Sunday night and done RACI. Oh, my goodness, we're going to shop, we're going to do food, we're going to pay bills. Ooh, I'm accountable this week. We have a relationship. This week my wife is pretty busy this is an embarrassing thing after this call I'm going to go and do some shopping. And then later today I'm probably going to do laundry. Next week I'm busy and she's going to do it. That's what the relationship is about. That's to me where I hope we move HR along and the debates about - remember I said the ten dimensions of a great HR function the organisation, the structure of the HR department isn't even in the top four of what delivers value to customers and investors.\nNC: Okay. Well, a lot to think about there. Let's sort of try and be a little bit practical about this. Natalie, just talk us through a little bit when you work with organisations how you turn some of these ideas we've already heard so far about what HR should be like and how it can give better value? What does that translate to in terms of the way it's structured, the roles if you like?\nNS: Yeah, yeah. I think the way it's structured is very, very important. As somebody who is operating as a Chief People Officer as well and as I also work at other CPOs as well. When we set out to do our roles as HR we generally have to think about we then delivering value to the business. In order to do that we have to think about the way that we position ourselves as a team and the way that we view the business as a whole. So one of the ways that we kind of think about our model or how I've thought about that model and how I would advice we think about it when we think about our new operating model is we need to look at businesses from the outside in. We need to be thinking about what are the forces that are impacting the businesses today. And those four says you'll find that a very similar to what impacts HR. Right.\nSo when you talk about HR being a product and I'll talk about how that links to the HR business models is when we look at the businesses right now everybody is employed by business, business does well from a revenue perspective. Everybody has got their jobs. If economic conditions are very difficult or suddenly a business needs to lay off that comes back down to HR and everybody else is impacted and those are the trends that tend to impact HR. So when we are thinking about things like AI, digitalisation all of that what is that looking like realistically for businesses today? It's practically what is happening to our business model. What is happening to the way that we think about our products. What is happening to the way that we - how we are looking to our competition. Do we need to revamp our services? Do we need to restructure, where do we then redeploy capital and investment within the organisation? Right. If we are now redeploying capital and organisation to now being more taken abled to now maybe moving from changing our products to utilise AI we're taking off capital somewhere. And usually that tends to be within operations teams within HR and etc.\nThe other thing that we should be thinking about that impacts us is HR professionals - obviously skill shortages. Those things impact how we think about how we set up our model as well. Skills shortages today are 77% high and we know that which digitisation more increased skills are going to be coming that's going to be increasing the type of skills that organisations will need. That will impact how we need to be setting up our operating model as HRs. And then we think about how do we even start to deploy the right type of talent into the business. With the mindset of where the business is going, the capabilities it needs from a skillset perspective from a leadership perspective etc. And so that also impacts a lot our model. And then of course the environment today is uncertain, it's dynamic, it's ever changing, it's exhilarating, it's exciting. It's scary.\nAnd so, we need to be thinking how we're creating a culture that is dynamic, that is easy to change, that is resilient. So I'll go back to how that then looks like for us. So that means we're not thinking about our operating models, we need to be thinking about how we're creating models that are networked. That are idol, that are interconnected with other business units as well. And to a degree with ourselves that are independent. How we're thinking about how do we upskill and develop a business and so how do we set up ourselves and develop the skills within a business. So how do we set up ourselves into our function? Do we old school L and D? Do we go talent management and intelligence? How do we start to think about that? And then what happens of course to all the tasks that we do on a day to day like admin, how do we free ourselves up to start to focus on those high-level things that again are cascading from the pressures from the business and impacting how we navigate and structure ourselves in order to serve our customers which are the business and the employees.\nNC: Okay. I want to go back to Dave in just a second on this. But Perry, just tell us a little bit how this remodelling works for you in practice working with organisations.\nPT: Yeah. I don't wish to embarrass Dave about this but I'm going to use him as a predictor of something. So he co-authored a book called the Boundary List Organization. A real Bible for me because at the time people were trying to put everything in boxes and this went against that. So thank you Dave for that. Now Deloitte's Human Capital Trends research report for 2024 talks about boundary list HR. And it absolutely is bringing this back into the modern times that we're in now. So what Natalie has talked about is a new form of dynamism that's needed in how we do that. But that can be very disconcerting for HR professionals who are seriously, strongly anchored in what we've created as professional disciplined fields, right. But as we've already sorted today that there's this intersectionality that we can play in. So you can be an L&D or ER or talent acquisition professional but how you need to work now is what Natalie and Dave have been describing along a value chain that's built around a product mentality for what we're doing to create value for the businesses.\nSo products, systems, science and process. There is all those things going on at various points and that expertise needs to come in at certain points. It doesn't need to be a kind of a really, handover fashion, we all huddle around that work. And that's where we need to be more boundaryless. But that's a challenge for people, that's attention and a dilemma we're not used to. If we think like we are which is what creates value for people int eh business. Let me just give you one example of policy. We write policies just above the point of misdemeanour so people don't do bad things. We should write policies at the highest level of noble and brilliant performance and behaviour because that's what people would buy if that was a consumable product. They wouldn't necessarily buy what just keeps me legal, they'd buy what makes me come to life in the work that I do. So I think that's the frame of reference we've got to change there, Nigel.\nNC: Okay. Well, Dave, it's like your life's work has been well dissected already. Just in terms of what the model looks like now how much of it is exactly the same as it was?\nDU: The absolute takeaway is when you're in it for me. And I've said it before I'll try to be very concrete. When I'm an HR person walking into a business meeting do not start with HR. Don't even start with strategy start with customer, investor community outside the company. One quick, quick anecdote I was doing a talk in front of a company one of the four high tech companies and there were hundreds senior people and I was scared to death, scared to death because they're all PHDs and chemistry and technology and physics and computers and my degree is in English literature - good grief. How do I get their attention? I said what do these companies have in common? These were Kodak, Digital Equipment, Compact, Toys R Us, Generally Electric Today. Somebody yelled out, they all went broke! And I yelled back I consulted for every one of them. And there was a moment of silence and then they started to laugh. And I said every one of those companies had great internal practices. And everyone did not understand what Natalie just talked about outside in. Eastman Kodak missed completely imaging and phone. They missed it they didn't get it and as a result they're gone.\nNC: And of course, Natalie, it's about creating those great internal practices. I just wonder I mean how we translate the big ideas, the boundarylessness, creating value for business. That has to turn into something tangible in how HR organise itself day to day and portions up the work. So just any tips on how you turn these big ideas into day-to-day operations?\nNS: It starts from the outside. Start with what the business is trying to achieve. You have your objective and results that you then take out as a business and say, look, if we achieve these this is how we would perform within the marketplace. This is how it would reflect to our stakeholders, our board etc. Agreed. Certainly, businesses should be open enough to share this kind of information and say this is how we do, if we do this would you come back to us. Profitable businesses should be thinking that way. But then when businesses have these numbers these numbers to everybody within the organisation at the bottom are just abstract. So they now need to be internalised into some kind of numbers that they then give themselves aspirationaly that say then right, how do we help the business achieve these things?\nAnd so, we as HR would then say having understood all of these departmental things that we are trying to achieve in service of this huge matrix that we have as a business is then to say, how do we make sure that the internal bit of the organisation have got the skills? Have got everything that the data that they need. Are we taking abled in order to support the business in that way? Are we making sure that are people are able to develop the skills that the organisation needs today? The organisation will need tomorrow? Whether that's a marketing team, whether that's a project team or sales team. And then we have to say what is actually disrupting our business when it comes to competition, when it comes to AI, when it comes to all of that? And we need data, data driven decisions that have been telling us what are the things that we need to do and not even just programmes but how do we need to look at our people. How do we need to change the experience that we do within the organisation as HR to make sure that our people are not burning out. We've got inclusion we've got all these things right. So we need to be set up in a certain way that does that and we need to have our own OPRs and KP metric that are highly tied to whatever else is happening across the business that is tied to everything else you're trying to do externally. And that's how we take these big ideas and bring them back home.\nNC: Perry, what would you add to what you actually deliver the transformation to make the new model work?\nPT: I've got an example, actually, and Dave will probably recognise this as not only a language shift but also a holistic approach to this, right. So there is this thing we call induction and for decades the thing has stank out the room. It's not an effective process. Talent acquisition or recruitment at the time would get somebody who was validated by competencies, they'd pass them over to administration who would do their contract and the legal stuff and give them a start date who would then transact with the manager to say expect the new person on a day. Land D by the way can you come in and do an induction for them? And it was a horrific experience.\nSo I worked with a company it was a bank in Eastern Europe who took and end to end product approach to this and said, what are we trying to do here? What's the OKR? The OKR is we want people who early on in their journey with us get a fantastic impression of us get their hands on some work and can serve customers in a way they want to. We don't need to vacuum pack them for three weeks before we let them loose by giving them talking head corporate stuff that they forget anyway. So talent acquisition, HR administration and learning development and managers and new employees and prospective employees came together to create a new product. What happened? That bank saved themselves about a million euros a year on lost hires because people got fed up about, the early stage part of their career and got attracted by other employers who offered them something better. That's an example where boundaryless means you don't work in your handover verticals. You come together who's got a vested interest in the outcome which is what the OKR would define and you work a bit together and you create something that has value. So there's an example where I think this could work.\nNC: Natalie, if you just look for potential new models there is so many out there from the McKinsey's and other organisations like that all promising ways of refashioning the whole structure of HR. Just a quick through on those various solutions and whether they're any good and how you find the right one?\nNS: I think what I would say is if there is going to be a structure for HR I think business partnering and consulting remains just by purely looking at how a lot of our organisations are structured today, I'm talking about small to midsize companies. Even within big companies business partnering remains and what does business partnering do today practically is the team that teams up with our leaders that helps them with their day-to-day employee relations, strategy, project management around the HR task that we're doing. So that's something that is going to continue to be critical in the future. I think talent strategy and intelligence is a critical one where in the future I think it's helpful for talent position to fold into talent management and there is a big reason for that. We can just look at the recent layoffs one the jobs that are most impacted is talent acquisition because businesses do not see it as a strategic function. It should be looking in at evolving to become more talent advisors folding into talent management and intelligence focusing on career mobility, skills intelligence, redeployment, workplace learning and development career mapping and planning and looking at all the skills that are going to be important to an organisation. Data analytics and intelligence is another one. People analytics is a crucial one that we should be thinking about in terms of how we structure our models as a team. And I would go and think about admin and think about fusing that sort of HR tech.\nNC: Let me ask all of the beginning with you Dave. How proactive HR needs to be on remodelling itself - what's the risk and what's the prize?\nDU: Again, I'm going to go back. I think HR has been remodelling itself always. There is not one new model. And one of the other things I have a pet peeve about is we love to see charge from to. I'm going from operational to strategic, from employer to organisation. From centralised to decentralised. I think that's false thinking. It's and / also. We need to do both. We need to be operational and strategic. Top down and bottom up, inside out and outside in. And that's the intersection I think I hear Perry. Boundaryless intersection collaboration, eco system, whatever term you want to call it. The principle is the same we've got to get people in different groups collaborating and that's what I heard from both Perry and Natalie.\nLet me give an example of where I think HR is headed and why it's exciting. I'm an HR person I go to a salesperson I say, can I join you on a customer call. And the salesperson says, why? And I say, I'm HR I'm here to help. By the way if you ever say you're here to help in HR you should get thrown out. That's just not - that's rhetoric that is just superfluous. You go, the salesperson is selling a product or service to a customer and I've done a lot of these. The customer looks at me the HR person says, who are you? And I say, I'm from HR and they say, why are you here? I look at that customer and say, first of all, you have an incredible salesperson. They just sold you a product or a service that will help you be successful. I've not listened to you I know what you need in terms of people, skills, organisation, culture. I now know what you want from us.\nI and HR have an accountability to back I call it an OKR to look at our people, our systems, our processes, Perry, I like your typology. Our systems, our systems, our processes, our staff. I'm going to go back and revisit every one of those. How we hire, train, who we hire. How we induct. How we develop. How we do DEI. How we do employer engagement. How we build culture. I'm going to go look at those so that we do what you need. Our salesperson just sold you a product. I want to build with you a relationship. And here is why, currently we have 40% of what you buy in us. Next year I'd like that to be 50 then 60, then 70, then 80. We want 80% of your customer share because I' m going to help build a relationship with you by aligning all of our HR practices against what you said you need more from us. That's very concrete. I don't see that happening enough. I still see us in HR focusing inside the business and I think we're going to see more of that outside in with customers and do the same thing with investors. That gets so exciting to me because it completely changes the agenda for HR. We don't have rhetoric, we don't have tools, we don't have processes. We add customer value, investor value and community reputation. That's for me a very exciting place where I think we're moving.\nNC: So Natalie, does that mean you really have to remodel or you can adapt like you've always done?\nNS: You can adapt. And I would say the best place to start is by focusing on your business focusing on the forces that impact your business. Understanding again, one thing we probably haven't really talked about is that when we are talking about HR operating models. It's not a one size fits all because every business is different. In many, many of our businesses you've got a two person HR team. And you can talk about HR model all you want but the reality is you've got two people and usually right it's an admin person and it's a head of HR who does both recruiting, does learning and development and then you've got the admin person. But what I will say is what we should be thinking about going forward as an HR function is and I'm a massive fan of technology and the way it's going to help us and this is where it's going to be exciting for HR.\nThe first thing we need to be thinking about is, yes, how do we deliver value to the business? In order for us to be able to do that we need to make sure that we're free, we're available to be responsive to think about those high-level things to build those relationships cross functionally. To sit down with our CEOs, understand exactly what keeps them up at night. Understand what keeps the executive team up at night, understand where there is gaps. And in order we do that is when we bog and chain ourselves from all the day to day minutia that come with administration, that come with general employer relationships, questions and all of that. AI will 100% automate that for us. We can do that with it and it will free us up to start to think about those things. And then we can keep ourselves up at night about the things that are very important for a business which is going to be we make sure that business that we have has got the skillset within the organisation for it to thrive? And I think that becomes the big task of the next coming era for HR.\nNC: Okay. And Perry Timms the risk of changing things and the prize?\nPT: I think the risk is that we can frighten people and distract them from the outcomes that we 've been talking about. So they will get too occupied with the model and not what the model is there to demonstrate. But I think the opportunity to remodel gives us a symbolic departure for people to get curious about and go, why are you doing that? How is that going to help me? And kind of invites some participation I suppose in what that model is there to do. So I'd like it simply as sports teams. Still have the same number of players on the pitch in similar positions but they might have a different mantra for how they are going to win their game and excite their supporters. So I think that narrative needs to kind of come through. And I think there is something about the key determinants of success here. We are going to help companies combine systems and energy in a way that's come into whatever challenge they're facing. Whether it's technological, whether it's consumer, whether it's climate, I think we've got to be stronger on combing systems and energy. And I think there are two value conversations where what value is the company there to create? But what do people who come to work their value in life? That's the congruency we're there to promote and if we say, a model will help us do that with more strength and conviction and predictability and certainty then that's how we pitch that model. Just to kind of show that departure and to give people a sense of something new is in town. That's what I would say.\nNC: Wow, clearly this was all about modelling but you need to have some deep thoughts first. Our grateful thanks to Perry Timms of People in Transformational HR.

      "summary": "Digital innovation has continued to move at an unprecedented pace. The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is making waves in core areas of business practice, and equally, if not more so, in the realm of L&D. 2023 research from the CIPD revealed that just 5% of respondents currently use AI to support L&D, with a modest 6% additionally planning to use AI into 2024. So what’s the opportunity here for learning professionals?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Radha Bharj, Co-founder of Rythmik and Erica Farmer, Co-founder of Quantum Rise, as we explore how learning professionals can embrace the disruption AI offers to increase their capacity to deliver impactful and effective learning for organisations?",
      "full_text": "Duration: 31:37\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Artificial intelligence powers our daily work tools, customer service relies on it, so why don't we use AI much in learning and development? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNow the other day I was online playing with one of those AI generators that comes up with punchlines for jokes and well here are three it came up with when I typed HR brought in AI to help with L&D only to find that...It was worried about the future of AI. Now this was clever. The AI was learning more from them than they were learning from the AI. Well, how about this one? HR brought in AI to help with L&D only to find that It doesn't work well with people. So, why isn't AI used so much in L&D yet? Well it seems while the switch from face-to-face to online learning during Covid brought many benefits it also left us wedded to rather generic and inflexible learning. I mean L&D must be struggling a bit to harness AI when you think that just 5% of learning professionals polled by CIPD were currently using it.\nSo, if the rest of business are merrily crunching vast data sets and optimising their supply chains with the help of AI then why not use it to improve learning? Maybe stretch that training budget. Well, joining me for the second of our podcasts on Everything AI a first self-confessed digital learning geek with 20 years L&D experience with top brands such as LV, British Gas and Virgin. She hosts the AI for the Average Joe podcast and is the co-founder of Quantum Rise. She's Erica Farmer. Hello.\nErica Farmer: Hi Nigel. Thank you so much for having me on this podcast today.\nNC: Really looking forward to it. And with her a specialist among other things in supporting HR and using AI to boost employee learning. She's got long corporate experience in financial services, energy and life sciences. She's the now Dubai-based co-founder and CEO of the work consultancy Rhythmic. It's Radha Bharj. Hello.\nRadha Bharj: Hello Nigel. Thank you so much for having me today.\nNC: OK. Now Radha, just 5% current adoption of AI in learning departments. Another 6% apparently trying to bring it in this year tops according to CIPD. It's not exactly impressive, is it?\nRB: Exactly it's not. And there's a lot of things that are sort of contributing to that. Right. So, firstly, the fact that a lot of this is still quite new. AI, although it's been around for a while through generative AI, which sort of emerged on November 30th 2022. What we've seen is, is that people are now more, it's become more accessible and therefore more and more people are using it. But there is this big thing around, you know, people not being able to, you know, using it so much in their roles, as you've kind of described at the moment.\nThere's lots of things that contribute to that. You know, technology and change is quite scary. You know, we're going through the fourth industrial revolution at the moment. The technology and AI is not going anywhere anytime soon. And we do need to adapt to the way that we work and the way that we use this and sort of, you know, the fair element around it. We need to work towards and make our teams more comfortable with using it.\nNC: I mean, Erica Farmer, I wonder why. L&D is on the back foot, people are hesitating to experiment or change. I think you've called it analysis paralysis.\nEF: Your numbers are definitely on the lower side than what I've seen for other polling and other information. But the narrative is the same that, are we just waiting to be taught how to use generative AI, ironically, in a learning function? Is it the analysis paralysis where we just don't know where to get started because it's so conceptual and there's so much going on and we're not entirely sure where the starting point is. We know there's probably not going to be a finishing point. So, that's quite difficult for some people. And as learning HR people, typically we're the type of personalities that like to talk. We like to consult. We like to engage. We like, we're good at that stuff, understanding business problems. That doesn't always equal action and impact. And sometimes we get caught up in company politics, ego, whatever it might be.\nBut actually, if you look at studies from LinkedIn Learning, from the World Economic Forum, for example, one of the top skills to support the future of skills is things like clear expression. So, as much as we're saying things like skills around being AI literate, prompt engineering, understanding the future of work are super important. I think sometimes we need to stop marking our own homework in regards to how we come across and work on things like clarity of how we engage with the business. If we're going to be at the forefront of new revolutions like AI.\nNC: OK, well, it might be helpful at this stage rather to just talk a little bit more about the technologies that are actually on tap here. Now, AI, we know simply the science of making machines that can think like humans. And that's been around, I think, since the 1950s. I mean, it's embedded everywhere, as I said at the beginning. Generative AI, that focuses on creating new data and chat responses, among many other things. Can you just sort of take this on and tell us in a bit more detail, what technologies we're talking about and how they might be helpful in devising, running and evaluating our learning?\nRB: Yeah, there's a few that are already in existence, right? So, like we've already sort of talked about, AI has been around for a number of years and actually within the L&D space as well, it's already, it's already being used. But there are a few areas that we can talk about now in terms of where it's sort of coming into play in the application of it. First of all, the personalised learning paths. Right. So, this is what we have learning that is given to learning. And it's based on their roles, their objectives, their preferences and their progress. And what that is giving them is more tailored, relevant content. And in a world where data and everything we have and everything outside of work as well is so personalised to our needs, we're bringing that external experience into our internal learning environment. And what does that mean? We're creating better experiences, better engagement rates, better effectiveness in the learning that we're giving to our to our employees. And therefore, that's going to have a positive impact on retention. Another area that we see this in is for content creation. So, specifically to your point, Nigel, as you mentioned, Gen-AI. Now, content creation using Gen-AI is everywhere. If you turn on the news, if you read any article, every single function is using it. And actually, even in the L&D space, creating content, that's also an application of it. And what is that in turn doing? It's freeing up our time as L&D professionals to focus on perhaps more complex design of learning, or do more in that time in terms of the delivery of it.\n \nAnother area is chatbots for support. So, you know, we've seen AI and chatbots again in our in our sort of personalised and we interact with our brands outside of work. But having chatbots coming internally again, it's been around for a while. But what we're seeing is we're able to provide that real time support to learners at the point of need in the flow of work. And another area I'd just like to touch on is, you know, AI avatars. You know, we're seeing more and more of this popping up now where we're creating again, more enhanced learning experiences which are more interactive, again, the more personalised and the more engaging. And then what are we getting as a sort of by-product of that or as a result of that rather, is that we're able to produce content a lot more quicker and it's a lot more cost effective, right? So, if you think about the prep that it takes to create shooting schedules around this, the actual shooting itself, the post and pre-production, you're seeing that. And then you're seeing that kind of getting freed up, too, and also your capacity as a function and what you're doing is freeing that up, too. So, these are just some of the examples, Nigel, that I wanted to sort of bring to life in terms of how we're seeing it at the moment in the world of work today specifically for L&D.\nNC: Erica, I'm getting slight warning bells ringing in my head about chatbots. I still can't get this image in my head of a sort of robot teacher like C3PO, you know, gliding up and down the aisles of a company. And I mean, if you take the chatbot. Some of the conversations we have with customer service chatbots are pretty dispiriting. So, can you infuse this a bit more and just take this on a bit more and explain how you begin the process of working out where the AI can help in both these areas of creation of content and then in delivery?\nEF: It's important to take a step back and understand how people are feeling around this technology because, you know, geriatric millennial, you know, born in 81, grew up with Star Wars, C3PO, movie franchises like The Terminator, Skynet, becoming self-aware, Judgment Day. You know, this stuff goes to the heart of people in our generation where they think, what happens if AI does become self-aware and our robot overlords, you know, come to rule us and all this kind of stuff. I laugh when I say it, but actually, you know, people are nervous around this and understandably so.\nOnly last year. Last year, we saw Hollywood go on strike because of these AI avatar potential. You know, what does that mean for my skill and my ability and me as a human? And what's the human robot relationship? That's why hearts and minds bridging that fear gap for people, I think, is the first place to start. When I work with clients and I start to talk to them about how what are your people saying about creating content with AI? Oh, well, what does that mean to my job? You know, or if I don't want to work with AI or become, you know, AI literate, where's my future career going?\nAnd actually, we need to recognize that there's a whole set of embedding skills that sit around this. And it enables you to automate the parts of your job that perhaps you aren't so enamoured with. For example, for me, that would be numbers, spreadsheets, you know, P&Ls. I already stick data into ChatGPT and I make it more visual for where we're spending money and where we're making profit. That kind of stuff. And it allows me to do more stuff like this, speaking to people because it frees up headspace, time space, time and energy. So, it's, this isn't just a technical upskill. This isn't just another business change project. The AI is going to change your life, both professionally and personally. And we are emotional social creatures. We know that in HR and L&D. So, this is where I think we start to get people on that journey. Then you do the hands on stuff with ChatGPT, get people to try and break it, create prompts that are going to make their personal lives a little bit easier rather than just having business prompts and things making your work more accessible.\nNC: And just before we leave you on this, you mentioned about people's fears, maybe they've delivered L&D in a particular way. This is something rather new. Do you think there might be people who need to think about working elsewhere? That this isn't going to suit them, that this change is going to be profound, whether they like it or not.\nEF: I mean, like any major change, you will get people who exit the workforce because it is a step too far. I mean, you know, bless her. My mum retired between Windows 8 and Windows 9, you know, because it was a stretch too far in terms of the operating system. She said, you know, I've learned enough in my working life. This is just too much for me. The time to go and do something else. So, I do think that's a potential. However, I often say and I thoroughly believe that L&Ders get excited about this kind of new way of doing things. And that's why you've got to let people talk about it, feel it, get hands on and also get excited about what the future means. Because if you listen to thought leaders like Dr. Philippa Hardman, the way she talks about L&D in three to five years is that the L&D function looks very different to how we typically see a design and delivery function today. It's more around quality assurance and making sure that the techs providing the best output for the learner and having the learners directly engage with generative AI as a learning tool to do role play with and things like that, rather than us being stuck in the mindset that actually I'm just going to use it to create e-learning and slides. And that's fine. That's the first step. We need a step by step plan, but that's not the be all and end all.\nNC: Well, it's interesting you mentioned mindset. I was going to mention that at the end, but seeing as you brought it up now, I just wonder, Radha, is there a kind of a L&D mindset thing at play here? Learning and development teams, I mean, have always sat right between the people that know, you know, the management, the executives, the subject experts and so on. And at the other end, the staff, the users, the people who need the learning, and they've just kind of delivered it from one side to the other. I mean, maybe it's hard for people to grasp. They've got to kind of get out of the middle. I mean, their job is to facilitate people accessing the knowledge, isn't it?\nRB: It's absolutely, you know, what you're saying is right. And I think there's also an element of accepting that it's everyone. So, the mindset absolutely is really, really important, regardless of kind of, you know, the function of a particular role. But, you know, if we talk about this very specifically, and Erica, you had mentioned sort of hearts and minds and things and, you know, the thing around empathy, kindness, values that make us better. The human intelligence versus the artificial intelligence is an understanding that both of that there is existence right now. And they each have their plate. So, understanding that from the mindset perspective and building awareness around that I think is really important, it helps eliminate the fear factor around it. I think the other thing that I like to talk to a lot of people around and you know our clients and stuff around is, just acknowledging that no one is an expert in this space.\nWe're all kind of on this discovery mode and this is not just unique within our organisations, within our teams. As a society we're still experimenting and it's OK, it's OK to be scared and I think that's probably where I would, where I would encourage people to start with the mindset and then sort of building the gaps, bridging the gaps that exist, you know, this whole piece around re-skilling and upskilling acknowledging that we need to do that is first of all the most important thing to do. And then secondly understanding, OK where are, where do we need to start with this because from what I see also is knowledge around AI and the specific use cases within HR and L&D, it's very patchy. So, you'll have some people who have a lot more knowledge. You have some people who are who are very much at the beginner side of this. So, just acknowledging that, that we have a very interesting landscape where we're sort of starting off is very important and building that through empathy, building that through kindness, building that through role modelling, encouraging psychological safety, eliminating some of the fear factor. Every day you put on the news, you know you look on LinkedIn and you know there's some sort of stat around how AI is going to replace us. So, just appreciate that it's going on at the moment and work with your teams on that within the profession I'd say.\nNC: OK so, we talked a lot about the mindset of the landscape. Let's be a bit more practical now. Erica can you maybe touch on one or two examples from your own experience of how and where AI can be brought in to deliver better training and maybe it's a big ask but could it help straight stretch that training budget?\nEF: Oh 100% and I would say let's park training, this is where we talk about L&D and HR having the learner own their learner journey and all these cliches that we hear. You know, stopping the L&D function pushing training via an LMS onto a large audience where we sheep dip. This for me is where the the easiest, the biggest and the most impactful change you can make it as an L&D practitioner is just having access to either whichever products you're using. You know, Gemini from Google you might be using Microsoft co-pilot that's just launched. A lot of people using ChatGPT in my experience. Even things like, where you would bring in professional actors or extra trainers and facilitators you know, you've got to think about that enablement mindset.\nSo, how can I enable my learners to work with the technology and use the technology as a coach or a trainer or a thought partner and work with it one-on-one. So, part of that might be an example where I'm sure we've all written management skill programmes, development programmes which take weeks and weeks and we build new powerpoints and resources and people sit in classrooms for days on end wondering what are they going to have for dinner at the end of the day nodding away. And you know, I'm being a bit kind of facetious when I say that but actually if you put the right prompt into ChatGPT, you can make ChatGPT a difficult team member and practice you're giving feedback to someone who's going to respond in a difficult manner. Or if you want to think about how you make broader, more critical, business critical decisions or complex problem solving, asking your large language model to play things like devil's advocate and your decision making or to ask it to become a certain persona, almost like you're working with an SME or an intern or somebody like that, another trainer, another facilitator.\nWe are only limited by our own creativity and imagination in this space and if you haven't gone on to ChatGPT and given it a persona of some kind, a difficult team member, a learning consultant, an instructional designer, a member of the exec that doesn't buy into the project that you're delivering and therefore won't sign the budget off. Practice your influencing skills, practice your communication, I find it really valuable in those, in those moments to really stretch your own thinking and not feel like you have to build this massive ivory tower of budgets and actors and trainers and resources and all this stuff that we're used to doing. When actually, a really good large language model can do that for you. Now caveat, if you're using open source like Open AI, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, you don't want to be putting sensitive information into these large language models because it's there owned by Microsoft. After that it goes out into the ether and anybody can access that data. So, this is where we need to also provide things like behavioural frameworks, when it comes to generative AI. Because you can't reprimand a learner or somebody in your organisation for putting data into ChatGPT, when they don't understand the impact of why they shouldn't be doing that.\nEF: So, there's the element of things that sit around like data protection like digital literacy like understanding how technology works. Critical thinking, problem solving etc, all of those human distinctive skills, like human intelligence that Radha talks about versus the artificial intelligence, that needs to be in your skills gap analysis organisationally as well as other things that you'd expect normally.\nRB: One thing I wanted to sort of add to what Erica's saying I think more than any time before this is a time where we do need to break the silos in our organisations and we need to work closer with technology and legal and all the other teams in the organisation to really understand the consequences, as Erica was just talking about right. And when we have those coming together, we're able to look at the bigger picture. So, yes from an L&D perspective this is what we're doing and this is how we want to do it but we understand the impact from legal. We understand the legal, the technical limitations that might surround some of those things. So, again we're working completely different, it's not just about the mindset now this is about the way that we work and embedding into our every day and how we innovate, ultimately.\nNC: It's interesting how so many conversations we have on this podcast about different innovations and things that are coming into the profession come back to that same issue about getting rid of silos and maybe here it's a necessary thing, you've got to talk to IT, haven't you? You've got to talk to the people who've got the knowledge and people to need it. One other thing from what I've seen, AI does seem to be right to help us have what was rather lost with the demise of face-to-face learning personalising the content. I mean, it's a bit of a paradox really because you're learning from a machine. So, I mean, how can you personalise learning? If you think of somebody on the job who needs knowledge information to do their job better, is there a way you can harness the AI?\nEF: Yeah, absolutely. So, Radha was talking earlier around using learning in the flow of work for example and we use that term quite a lot in HR and L&D but not everybody really knows what it means. I mean for me that's accessing learning when I need it, when I'm doing my job right so, if say, I'm in a contact centre and I'm speaking to a client and my client has a certain policy that I don't quite understand the ins and outs of.  Can I access some knowledge particularly hosted by a large language model that gives me two or three lines so in the moment I can understand what that policy is about for example.\nNC: Well, you could be sitting in the car about to go in and see somebody.\nEF: Absolutely or I could be sitting outside the office waiting to go and have a disciplinary with one of my team members and I don't know what to say, we know that managers find the difficult conversation, one of the toughest skills. So, actually can I quickly work with my LLM to say right, you know, what's the best way to land this message or could we just quickly practice this before I go and do it in person? Or I think that access to knowledge and then facilitating of skill, in the flow of work is how I personally see and for all the experts and people that I work with, where personalization really comes into its all.\nNC: Yeah, I mean Radha, I was reading a piece in Forbes, we had mentioned, Erica there of learning management systems it was describing how an AI powered system couldn't you know tailor individual learning to people's needs and tasks, harvest the data, use it to improve the learning experience for everybody. I mean is this happening yet, I know you're in Dubai, you've knowledge of what else people are doing in the world. Are we that sophisticated with AI?\nRB: And there are nations in the world that are very much looking at sort of the upskilling around AI. So, Singapore for example have upskilled and reskilled their employees through a programme which was announced a few weeks ago in fact. Where they are helping people understand how to obviously use AI. So, there's lots of different programmes that nations are doing based on their own AI vision and strategies and where they want to go with it and obviously the upskilling and reskilling and people development aspect of it's incredibly important. So, we're not just looking at this from a an organisational perspective now, this is this is far greater right on a sort of nation level that countries are now basically doing.\nNC: OK so trying to draw all this together, I mean clearly there's a lot to do. Erica some tips then, ideas on how you start this collaboration across the organisation to harness the AI to use it more as we say both to prepare content and then to allow people to use it for better results.\nEF: Yeah so, what's the problem that you're trying to solve? I think in L&D, we're very good at jumping in to solutionise and AI might not be the answer to everything. So, let's just put that out there. If the problem statement does involve cross collaboration across functions implementing AI to do xyz. How do people feel about that? Hearts and minds, we've talked about that. Give people the space to grumble and moan and worry and be excited and be shocked and all of the emotions that sit within that because if you don't deal with that element for people then it that's going to keep bubbling up and affect it you know, embedding skills and implementation and stuff like that. Understand what's in it for me so, the first exercise I tend to run in some of our hands-on workshops is, we're going to build a very basic prompt in ChatGPT but I want you to build a prompt that's going to make your personal life easier, rather, we're not thinking about work, we're not thinking about business, you know, and I'm getting wonderful examples from people saying things like I've got the mother-in-law from hell, I never know what to buy for Christmas, she likes these kind of perfumes or products, I never know where to buy them. ChatGPT give me a list of five things I could buy my mother-in-law for Christmas.\nYou know, so once you start to drop those barriers with people, people get it. The light bulbs start to get on, they realize they're not being done to because they've had a chance to talk about it and share how they feel. They've started to understand the purpose and what that means to the organisation and its clients or learners or whoever that might be. They've started to do the WIFM, the what's in it for me, started to use the technology and you build your frameworks around that. Your do, do this, don't do that when it comes to data and that stuff. You bring it together as a full facilitated skill set, people need to understand the benefit of using this technology for you know, their productivity, the motivation the, you know, if you are using it for creating content great but actually that's just the first run on the ladder. What else can you be using it for? How can you stretch it? How can you work towards being agile and using and I think Microsoft's been very clever with this term by the way. Using your LLM as a co-pilot, as a digital colleague to almost outsource part of your job that you don't want to do.\nEF: I mean who wouldn't want to do that right? There has to be the right safeguards. There has to be the things that sit around that and the governance and all of that good stuff. Of course there does. But I think just get started and talk to IT, HR, senior leaders, understand what your organisational stance is likely to be on this but don't just look inwards, look outwards. There's so many great resources from organisations like UNESCO, you've got the Global Observatory which is an online website. There's a bunch of great templates on there for policies, procedures, frameworks, exercises. Reach out to experts like you know, Radha and myself. Well, we can support you on this stuff as well and the CIPD and the content that you guys are creating. There's a bunch of really good stuff there. Just get started.\nNC: And you mentioned experts, obviously some excellent ones out there but also a lot of AI snake oil salespeople and of course one of the jobs often is assessing outside solutions. Where it does need to be a wall garden rather than just people using generative AI. So, any thoughts on how you bring in the right partners Radha and don't waste your money?\nRB: Understand what you're using today. Because it's probably likely that there is an element of AI that's already in what you're using today as an organisation. But it also helps you understand actually, what else is out there. So, at the moment we're doing this is what currently exists and what is next and does that then satisfy some of the criteria that we're looking for that Erica kind of described earlier. You know, where is it that we want to go with this but get familiar with what you're doing at the moment. What you've got in your own organisation, I would also go a little bit further and I'd say when you're starting off this journey, understand what your organisation broader than just the HR function is doing in the AI space also. It's very credible as a function to also know the application of what we're doing externally out of the function in that space too. But definitely watch out for that because wherever you go at the moment you know, being powered by AI is kind of everywhere at the moment. So, just make sure that you're, that you're aware of that.\nEF: Yeah I think that's such an important point. So, to give you a really tangible example of that, I was at a education conference in November and we ran a workshop but in the morning, there was a lot of kind of ops directors, chief learning officers etc on the conference floor being kind of wooed by all the vendors as you get at these kind of exhibitions, giving away free merch and hey we've got AI doing this and AI doing that and neural networks. And we ran this workshop me and my business partner and this lady came up to us afterwards and she went, I get it now. I get it. She said I've spent three hours walking around the conference hall talking to these vendors and I haven't got a clue what they're talking about, telling me the AI is going to do this and the new AI functionality in their platforms. And she said it went right over my head and because of that I didn't understand the facts, let alone the benefits to my organisation therefore, I was never going to buy. But now I understand I've got AI 101 effectively. I now know what they were talking about.\nSo, there's an ask I think for vendors particularly in the tech space with HR and L&D, not to just throw jargon at people and expect people to get excited about this stuff as much as we do because we're probably about 10% on the bell curve at the beginning. Pretty much every, the 80% is everybody else in the middle and it's going to those folk, whether it's their own fear, their own understanding, wanting to get it right, Radha you psychological safety, super important in organisations and we know that's a big problem and specifically in HR functions. You know, actually we need to be confident and knowledgeable and OK with making these decisions in a real agile way and if we're just surrounded by vendors or communications with just a load of jargon we don't get, we go back to that analysis paralysis that we started with.\nNC: Excellent, well tips for vendors as well as people in the people profession. There we must leave it. Super thanks to Radha Bharj Rhythmic and Erica Farmer Co-Founder of Quantum Rise. Great to share time with two people with such positive angles on the future of AI. Beyond using AI in L&D, we have done a podcast on the wider implications of AI for people professionals in general particularly, how the large language models GPT3 and 4 might help in your delivery and effectiveness. It's on our podcast page on the CIPD website, it's edition number 195 and you'll also find a transcript there or you should indeed be able to find it wherever you get your podcast in which case subscribe when you're there, so you don't miss an edition. But until next time from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us on the podcast team, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "Awareness of what it means to be neurodivergent has grown amongst employers, as well as the understanding of the value this talent pool offers the organisation. But what does it mean to be neuroinclusive? Are we in danger of pigeon-holing or shoehorning neurodivergent talent into specific roles? And is there more that we can do to create workplaces that respond to individual working preferences?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Kevin Lyons, Senior HR Manager at Pearson; Alex Hirst, Co-founder of Hoxby; and Dr Jill Miller, Senior Diversity and Inclusion Policy Adviser at CIPD, as we explore how you can make your organisation more neuroinclusive.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 31:10\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Neurodivergence may be better understood. So, why do workers experience discrimination just because they interact with the world differently? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\n \nWhen you think about it, every business or organisation is neurodiverse because no-one has a standard-issue brain. But that doesn't make our organisations neuro inclusive. So, this podcast is about what it takes to give everybody the chance to shine in their job. It's about meeting the particular needs of the one in five of the population who have what's sometimes termed \"alternative thinking styles\". I mean, how might you adjust work routines? Or how do you deal with people? How should you tweak your recruitment tactics to find untapped talents? What are the wider business benefits that maybe you could be missing out on? Joining me: three guests, each with a unique take on this topic. Alex Hirst is co-founder of Hoxby, a global community offering freelance business services. For him the key is allowing individuals to choose their work style. In fact, he's co-authored a book on the subject. Hello, Alex. \n \nAlex Hirst: Hello, thanks for having me.\n \nNC: It's a welcome return to the podcast for Kevin Lyons, senior HR manager at the digital learning provider, Pearson. Himself, neurodivergent, has pioneered a raft of measures to help support neurodivergent employees and recruits. Hello, Kevin.\n \nKevin Lyons: Great to be back. And hi, Nigel.\n \nNC: And, from the home team, a senior diversity and inclusion advisor who combines research and engagement to help shape CIPD thinking on this and related areas. It's Dr Jill Miller. Hi, Jill.\n \nJill Miller: Hi there, Nigel.\n \nNC: So, Jill, I'll start with you. I mean, all these responsibilities: equality, diversity and inclusion, and now neurodiversity to the fore as well. For clarity, just kick us off with a reminder of what neurodiversity stands for.\n \nJM: So, I think this is an important place to start. And at CIPD, we've been working with neurodiversity training company Uptimize to produce some guidance on neuro-inclusion at work. And we also look at some of the terminology and language within that. And in the guide, we talk about neurodiversity being the natural variation in human brain functioning.\n \nNC: And, of course, it also becomes a little bit confusing, because so many words that added after the neuro, we've got people who are neurodivergent. That is what exactly?\n \nJM: All brains are different. I think some people with really broadly similar ways of thinking and communicating and processing information can have this sense of shared identity and shared experience. And, for example, that could be identity as autistic, as dyslexic or dyspraxic, or as an ADHD'er. And I think people who possess one or more of these identities often identify or are referred to as neurodivergent. And you might hear somebody who doesn't identify as neurodivergent referred to as neurotypical.\n \nNC: Okay, that's pretty clear. And then finally, to sort of complete the set, when we speak of neuro-inclusion as being a sort of desirable state for an organisation. What is that? What is it to be neuro-inclusive?\n \nJM: A neuro-inclusive workplace is a workplace that embraces and values all types of information processing, learning and communication styles. And essentially, it's where neurodivergent individuals feel valued, respected, treated with dignity, and that they have true equality of opportunity at work.\n \nNC: Okay, so that's pretty clear then, Kevin Lyons, you are, you told us, neurodivergent. So, I mean, can I ask you, what is your divergence? That sounds like a terrible panel show, doesn't it? What's your divergence? And what impact does it have on how you work with people?\n \nKL: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Nigel. And just to build on what Jill was saying, I think the US National Symposium definition really nails it, which says that neurodiversity is a concept, where neurological differences are to be recognised and respected as any other human condition. And I'm ADHD, and I'm autistic. And how does it affect me? I have things that I can do very well and what I call my strengths. For example, I love anything to do with strategy and seeing the big picture. And I have a number of things that I can juggle in my brain at any one time. And my autism allows me to see patterns and details and inconsistencies that maybe others can't see as readily. What adjustments do I need? I need the adjustment that, you know, I do have several things going on in my brain at any one time. I may just hyper-focus on something for a while. I may have a certain sensitivity to certain things. For example, my autism, is there's a sensitivity to sound and brightness of light. So, those kinds of things impinge in my day, regularly, but yeah, I mean I have key strengths, and this is the message really to any organisation, neurodivergent people bring great strengths.\n \nNC: And are there any kind of tells? If you're in a meeting with people and you are getting a bit upset or frustrated, would other people be able to tell? Do you try and mask that sometimes?\n \nKL: Masking's a really important area, Nigel, glad you mention it. Many neuro-diverse people will mask in the workplace. I'll give you an example. My autism means that I stim. That means I flick my fingers, and that's a regulation of enthusiasm. Many autistic people will stim in some sort of way, it may be some sort of head tipping, or it might be wiggling their toes or flapping their hands. Obviously, in the workplace that might be distracting to people, so what I do is if I feel I'm going to stim, I wrap my hands, I put my hands in my lap or something like that. Now, all the time that I'm doing that masking, I'm not spending time thinking about the thing that I should be thinking about.\n \nNC: Interesting. So, Alex Hirst, the CIPD found one in five neurodivergent people have said they experience what they see as harassment or discrimination. That's a really high number, isn't it? I'm just wondering whether you think the way they're treated by their managers that makes them feel that way? I mean, is that conscious on the part of the managers? Pretty serious barrier, isn't it between neurodivergent people and decent work?\n \nAH: Yeah, and I think we often talk about physical disability and the extent to which that is experienced as a deficit by the person is really about the environment in which they're operating. And it's the same with neurodiversity. When people are in an environment that isn't supportive or conducive to their way of thinking, then it can create difficulty and masking and things like this happen. And it's where people feel like they are different or are not included in the way that a neuro-inclusive business would be. But I don't think this is necessarily intentional on behalf of managers, I think that this is generally a lack of understanding. But also, I think it's indicative of holding on to outdated working principles that really haven't moved on with our understanding of neuroscience.\n \nNC: Without going into too much of the detail, which we can in a minute, you're saying people just aren't autonomous enough?\n \nAH: I think autonomy is really helpful in this situation, the more that you can enable people to create their own work environment, the better that is for neurodivergent people. But I think it's also things like hanging on to the idea that we have to all be in an office working at the same time in order to produce work, which is something that's borne out of an industrial age way of thinking where we had to all be in factories at the same time to operate machinery. But now most of the work people do is actually with their minds rather than with their hands. And as a result, we need to create work environments that get the most out of people's neurodiversity.\n \nNC: OK, well, we can talk a bit more about those work environments in just a moment. But Jill Miller, I want to just sort of look at this so-called \"employment gap, neurodivergent employment gap\". I mean, that is a thing, isn't it? I mean, is there any evidence, any stats? Can you, sort of, shed any light on this?\n \nJM: Yeah, there is data on an autism employment gap. The Buckland review of autism employment, led by Sir Robert Buckland, I think really highlights this. And the report says that just three in 10 autistic adults are in work, compared to five in 10 for all disabled people, and eight in 10 for non-disabled people. So, I think a really significant gap that I think employer action here is, is really needed with many, many benefits for the business as well.\n \nKL: Yeah, I think the other thing is, though, about the data is how many neurodivergent people are actually saying that they're neurodivergent when they come into an organisation. Because, if you do not think that it's a safe environment, then as a neurodivergent people, you're not going to volunteer the fact that you're neurodiverse. That's that. That is a fact. And this is why I say one of the key things that organisations need to do is to be explicitly neurodiverse, inclusive, and they can do that in a series of ways.\n \nJM: Yeah, I think building on Kevin's point, I think it's really important we create organisations where people feel safe and comfortable to talk about their neurodivergence if they want to. The survey that we did at CIPD found that around three in 10 neurodivergent employees haven't told their line manager or HR about their neurodivergence. But really interestingly, we asked, \"Well, why was this?\" and while 44% said it's a private matter that they didn't want to share and, of course, that needs to be respected. Almost two fifths said they're concerned about people making assumptions based on stereotypes, a third feel there's too much stigma. And 29% said they're concerned about the possible impact on their career.\n \nNC: And, Alex Hirst, I can see an immediate tension here. On the one hand, what you seem to be saying is that there are people out there in the workplace who have something to offer and are not getting to an interview. We can talk about interviews in a minute, and they're not joining organisations, but at the same time, we're also saying there's a risk of pigeonholing or shoehorning neurodivergent people into particular roles they're thought to be good for.\n \nAH: Yes. And I think pigeonholing and stereotyping is the thing that needs to be avoided. And when we talk about the design of work in itself, then we need to think about designing work that is inclusive of everyone, and starting with neurodivergence is a great place to begin. But really, what we're talking about is trying to normalise individual preferences and individual work styles and support people to deliver their best work in that way.\n \nNC: So, we've talked about not stereotyping, but also playing to people's strengths. If you are stereotyping a bit or not making the best use of your neurodivergent people, how do you kind of break out of that?\n \nAH: I think stereotypes can be helpful for the macro conversation about involving more neurodiverse people in work. They certainly do have character traits and skills that could be relevant for different types of work. But I think we mustn't lose sight of the fact that everybody is individual. And neurodiversity is a spectrum. And it, we just need to remember that people have individual skills and attributes, contributions to bring to the workplace that may not fall into those generalisations. So, I think what's important is for organisations to define exactly what it is they're trying to output and deliver and achieve and find the right person to deliver that. And ideally, look at the entire spectrum of neurodiversity when considering applications for it.\n \nJM: I think Alex makes really important points there about recognising that every person is different. And I think although certain strengths may be typically associated with different neurodivergent identities, we shouldn't make assumptions or generalisations across a whole group of people, because everyone will have different career aspirations. So, I agree with Alex here.\n \nNC: And yeah, Kevin, you were saying at the beginning about the things you were really good at. You were telling me beforehand about a potentially difficult hire for an organisation where somebody solves some massive problems. Just tell me that story.\n \nKL: Yeah, and I support what Alex is saying about stereotypes. But I do think it's also important to understand strengths. And this might be helpful to organisations. So, we discussed, when I was working for a software company, we had great difficulty recruiting people to do bug-fixing, it's relatively simple to get people to be recruited. You could develop code, but nobody wanted to fix the mistakes those developers made in their code. We recruited somebody who's profoundly autistic, and the manager agreed to a work trial. And so, we gave that person some code, where the bug-fixing team knew there was a bug, but they'd been unable to diagnose it for several days. And that person found inconsistencies deep in the code within 10 minutes. So that's, that's a pretty profound strength to me.\n \nNC: So, Jill, of course, a lot of this, as we were hearing earlier from Alex is down to the historical design and nature of work. Can you sort of start talking us through how you start reviewing the way people work and how that can be improved, just both for the lives of the neurodivergent people already in the workforce, and to actually make the organisation happier and more productive.\n \nJM: I think it's really important we firstly look at line manager training and awareness around neurodiversity. Less than half of the employers we surveyed said that managers feel capable and confident to support neurodivergent individuals at work. That's a figure that really shows we need some action here. A lot of what we're talking about in your inclusion is about good people management. But for people to be able to ask for support and ask for adjustments at work, we need this open, supportive and trusting culture we talked about before. I think for people to perform at their best as well, that's something we need a really good relationship with our manager. And those trusting relationships are so important that people feel able to have these conversations. But I think what is fundamentally important, what an organisation really needs to shift on here, is manager job design. Is the people management aspect of a manager's role valued enough compared to the technical aspect? And I think that is a really important one, because managers need to be able to feel they can prioritise that people management side of what they do to really support people. And I think Alex mentioned about individual needs. And this is about understanding how to best support an individual.\n \nNC: Because, Alex Hirst, there's a kind of irony here that during the pandemic, there was a lot more people working on their own. And we seem to be, kind of, almost rowing back from what might have been a better working environment for some people in this situation.\n \nAH: The pandemic opened people's eyes to different ways of working. And I think we've been doing it for the best part of 10 years. And what we have found, in terms of inclusive work for neurodivergent people, is that remote work can be much better, because an individual can control their work environment more, but also, the requirement is for much more explicit communication. So, a lot of it happening on written word, but also briefing and working more towards outputs, rather than, sort of, soft and vague job descriptions, which tends to work better when you're working remotely. So, there's been improvements. But yes, to your point, we see a lot of \"return to office mandates\" in, making the headlines at the moment. And of course, that's concerning for us, because we think that's missing the opportunity for neuro-inclusion.\n \nNC: Well, Kevin Lyons. I know your own organisation is remote a lot of the time, we've talked about it on previous podcasts, but can you just talk a little bit about how you have upped your game across the organisation with your existing workforce? I mean, what was the process? And then briefly, what are some of the reasonable adjustments that you've made for people?\n \nKL: Yeah, of course, of course, Nigel. Yes, we did discuss the importance of flexible working, CIPD podcast 200, check it out. And.\n \nNC: Excellent plug.\n \nKL: And I think the jewel in the crown of what they have to do at Pearson is that every employee has the opportunity to get a formal diagnosis of neurodiversity, if they wish. And we do that through the occupational health referral process. And the company health partners that we use for that has a partnership with Lexxic, the neurodiversity specialists. So, if an employee is referred for a neurodiversity diagnosis through that process with the manager's cooperation. And I'll look, I'll come back to that manager point, then we can undertake a formal diagnosis. This is incredibly important for many people, because to understand that you have a developmental condition, or chronic condition, and you are neurodivergent, can very much help the planning of accommodations and adjustments. And I've lost count of the amount of people that have told me that they've had a formal diagnosis, that it has changed their life. And it is very difficult to get a formal diagnosis on the NHS, and it can take several years, and private health options are also expensive. That's the first, sort of, plank in the inclusion route. The other one was to focus on our recruitment and to look at the entry routes into the company, be they LinkedIn be they Glassdoor or the that they Indeed website, and to have a neurodiversity reach-out statement, which basically says we're a neurodiversity inclusive employer, and we welcome applications from neurodivergent people, we have an employee resource group that champions neurodiversity. And please tell us if you need any accommodations and adjustments, that simple reach-out statement says, \"come on in the water's fine. This is a safe place\".\nWe've also focused on the onboarding experience, so that during the onboarding, the individual knows that we are neurodiversity-inclusive employer, and they also have the links to our Employee Resource Group. I'm the Chair of the Employee, Co-chair of the Employee Resource Group for disability and neurodiversity. So, we put it under the disability umbrella, but we recognise that there are neurodiverse people who do not recognise themselves as having a disability. Some do, some don't. So, we're within that Employee Resource Group. And I lead as the Co-chair only on neuro diversity inclusion. So, we have a laser focus. And that provides also a safe space for neurodiverse people who wish to speak to other neurodivergent people in the organisation.\nThe other thing is education awareness. And we've run a number of education awareness sessions for employees, but also for leadership teams, where I stress the business opportunity with neurodiversity inclusion. Because let's just think about that. One in five people, that is a lot of employees in any organisation and that is a lot of customers in society and it's a lot of people in society generally. So, that's the opportunity. Flexible working is fundamental, and we've embarked on a flexible working approach with no mandated return to office and we've trusted people and we've given them goals and parameters. And that is an absolutely essential element of any neurodiversity-inclusive organisation, as Alex has rightly pointed out. The one area where we're working on at the moment is manager guidance, and that's building on Jill's point and Alex's point. The importance of managers having an understanding about neurodiversity, neurodiversity-inclusion and being able to know where to go for accommodations and adjustments. And my experience is managers are very welcome to any education awareness about this subject, and keen to be involved in help. And that occupational health process I talked about, has led to many productive associations between manager and employee, as the manager understands better the person's neurodiversity and how they can plan accommodations and adjustments.\n \nNC: I mean, Jill Miller, this still comes down to the role of the people manager. I mean, if you know your people as individuals, surely you should be picking up a lot of these things. Why is it we need a process?\n \nJM: For many organisations, neurodiversity isn't on their radar. I think it is an integral part of equality, diversity and inclusion. And I think a real starting point here is this real concerted effort to raise awareness, not just of neurodiversity, but of the value of neurodiversity to the business. I think that's the really important point. Then, as I mentioned before, we need to be looking at our people management style. We need to be looking at, as Kevin said, how we bring people into the business. And I think that starts at looking at things like how we make job descriptions.\n \nNC: All right. Well, let's just take that as an example, what's wrong with the way that jobs are advertised?\n \nJM: Well, I think, when we're creating job descriptions, I think there's a tendency to be reusing past job descriptions without really thinking about what's needed for a particular role, and what are the real strengths and capabilities needed? And I think, often they become this long list of skills and capabilities that we'd love somebody to have when they come into the business. But essentially, that could be leading us to hire generalists, and could be inadvertently excluding people with real narrower strengths or deep level expertise in certain areas.\n \nNC: But when you say excluding people, you mean that somebody would look at that list of requirements and not bother to apply?\n \nJM: Yeah, I think so. I think some people may look at a long list and think if we can't tick all of the aspects of it, then maybe this job isn't for us. So, I think it is really important to be thinking about what's integral to the role when we're writing a job description, even to, sort of, put it into two sections of \"must haves\" and \"nice to haves\", sort of skills and capabilities. And I think this could really sort of help to widen the talent pool that we're attracting from.\n \nNC: Alex Hirst, does this resonate with the kind of work you do with the company?\n \nAH: It does resonate, yes. And I'm thinking about the example that Kevin gave earlier about the individual who solved the coding challenge that people were struggling with. And it sounded to me like that person had a really clear brief, really understood the parameters of what was required and was able to deliver against it very easily. And I think that's where job descriptions invariably don't appeal to neurodivergent people in that, as Jill was saying, they've become vague and lack that clarity. But I think also, as Jill was saying, we should look at the value of neurodiversity, in terms of having different ways of thinking within our organisations. And that's what we think of as cognitive diversity, which is to say, if you have lots of people who look, think, talk and act the same, you get lots of agreement, and you get what's known as \"group think\". And you know, when we think about the value to business, we always talk to our clients about what's the cognitive diversity of your organisation like? How differently are your people thinking, how much disagreement are you getting as a result? How are you harnessing those differences of opinion, to arrive at better solutions? Because that's where your business is more intelligent, collectively, and where you are going to make greater gains.\n \nNC: And while we're with you, Alex, I mean, this can make communication slightly complicated. I mean, I did see some advice for managers on working with neurodivergent people. It said \"some people don't get humour or sarcasm, so don't use that. Others are fazed by open questions. So, don't ever ask an open question\". I mean, surely you can't tailor all your communication to suit everybody. I mean, business will be quite dull if you did, but equally I can see that some people might miss out. You know, we've all worked for a sarcastic boss, haven't we?\n \nAH: Yeah, and we've all tried sarcasm as a sense of humour. I think that we're on a very fast learning journey here, about how to evolve the way that we communicate, and what a lot of people are trying to unlearn things like corporate jargon that have really clouded the way people communicate in the workplace, particularly. So, you know, a step back to more clarity in the way we communicate, I think, can only be a good thing. For a lot of us who don't understand the acronyms and the turns of phrase that we hear sometimes at work. So, I think this is more about going back to basics a little bit, being clearer about what we expect of one another, what our goals are, and taking the time to just articulate that properly. That's where I think there's opportunity and where, as managers, we can invest a little bit more time to get a better return.\n \nNC: Okay, so we've almost got to the end of our time here, perhaps a passing thought from each of you on what struck you about the best routes to, kind of, measurable progress on this? So, let's start with Jill. I mean, what should you do next? And how do you know your strategy is starting to work? \n \nJM: So, from our research, we know that flexible working, providing access to clear and reasonable adjustments can really make a significant difference to people's working experiences. And we've been talking about those things quite a lot already. But one thing I'd like to add here is that adjustments that we know benefit neurodivergent people to perform at their best at work, are also often welcomed by many different people for many different reasons. I think a lot of what we're talking about with neuro-inclusion just makes good business sense. It helps people to perform at their best, it involves listening to the individual, and responding to individual needs, as well as doing things across the workplace as a whole to make our workplaces more accessible and more inclusive.\n \nNC: Great, and Kevin, how would you sum up what you've tried to do in your work?\n \nKL: I think, support Jill's point really, that every organisation wants to get the best out of their people. Every organisation wants to recruit the best people, I think every CEO says that \"we recruit the best people\". No CEO says, \"we recruit average or not so great people\". So, I think we're looking to get the very best out of the people that we employ, of which we know one in five are neurodivergent, in virtually every organisation, and we're also looking to recruit the very best people. So, having as wide an approach in terms of recruitment, bringing in as many neurodivergent people into your organisation is going to benefit the organisation. I think, as a build as well, I'd say that those adjustments and accommodations that an organisation has made, and the one that I worked for has made, you start to see a greater awareness, an understanding of neurodiversity-inclusion, and you see a benefit around employee experience as well. And I think it's a journey, and you keep working on it. I've talked about manager guidance as being something I want to do where I'm working at the moment, but it's also an ongoing journey. And we have talked about flexible working, and that's an ongoing journey and debate. So, we keep trying to make the improvements, but it will, in time, benefit all organisations in terms of productivity, in terms of insights, in terms of employee experience.\n \nNC: And Alex Hirst?\nAH: Yeah, I do agree. I think that neuro-inclusion is the, probably the fastest step to inclusion more broadly, in terms of the way we work, given that so much of the work we do now is with our brains. And if, as organisations, we want brain power, then we need to change the way that we work in order to increase our access to that brain power and increase our collective intelligence. And for me, that means letting go of the outdated principles of place-based, time-based working and adopting new digital age methods, like we do at Hoxby, work style. Giving people choice and independence to define their own work style really is the thing that we feel passionately about, because it breaks down the stigma of someone being different or requiring something different to someone else. We're actually trying to normalise the idea of individuality, because that will get us there quicker.\n \nKL: Yeah, I totally support what Alex is saying. And I think the more flexible and the wider you look at the employment of people, and then you're going to have a better environment to enable you to be the best business, because neurodivergent people can invariably see things that maybe other people can't see, for example, or they may have a view, which may be a brilliant game-changer for the organisation but everybody else has been unable to see it.\n \nJM: This is about recruiting really talented and skilled people into the organisation. It's about expanding that talent pool that you're recruiting from. We know organisations are having difficulties recruiting and filling vacancies. I think neuro-inclusion offers huge opportunities here. But this is also about retention. I think people are more likely to stay for an organisation, stay with an organisation where they feel included, they feel they're treated fairly. Because in our survey, we found that a fifth of neurodivergent employees we surveyed said their experience at work in relation to their neurodivergence had a negative impact on their intention to stay. And so, I think that's quite a poignant point there.\n \nNC: Good point to end on. Well, thanks very much indeed to Kevin Lyons from Pearson, Alex Hirst from Hoxby and CIPD's Jill Miller. There's some great resources to be found on the CIPD website, including some newly published guidance and principles, working with Uptimize to help in creating a neuro-inclusive organisation.

      "full_text": "Duration: 31:43\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: There really is no time to lose in making our businesses environmentally sustainable. But should people professionals get involved? And if so, how? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNow, are you really doing all you can to decarbonize your organisation? Six out of ten of today's biggest business risks relate to sustainability, according to the World Economic Forum. Yet only around half of organisations have made meaningful reductions in their carbon footprints. That's doing things like adopting energy-saving technology, new working practices and switching to sustainable materials. I mean, it is a puzzle because, of course, customers want to deal with greener organisations, your staff care about this. So, if company leaders are faltering on sustainability, is it time HR stepped in to identify poor practice and become change agents?\nWell, let's find out. With us, a senior banker turned board sustainability advisor. Her mission to turn corporate ESG activity from what's too often seen as a marketing exercise into a powerful tool. She's Gilda Nieman, board director at Chapter Zero in Brussels, a forum that helps executives embed climate into business strategy. Hello, Gilda.\nGilda Nieman: Hello.\nNC: From the home team, we welcome CIPD's senior corporate governance advisor, Susannah Haan. She says leaders need to be given the confidence to initiate change. Hi, Susannah.\nSusannah Haan: Hello.\nNC: And a return visit to the podcast for an occupational psychologist with a focus, among other things, on behaviour change in business. She's currently updating the CIPD's sustainability guide, which she authored. It's Dr. Jan Maskell. Welcome back, Jan.\nJan Maskell: Hello, everyone.\nNC: So, Jan, I'll start with you. As I say, you were here when our podcast 174 probed the business case for sustainability. It's still there, still a useful listen. We had a real-life case study. We looked at setting goals and measuring effectiveness. We considered supply and value chains. But, Jan, I think it's fair to say that sustainability actions within a business were really seen as strategic matters for leaders rather than HR. I mean, is that still the case? Has much changed in the last three years?\nJM: I think that's a really interesting question, Nigel. I think it's not only a strategic issue, but it's an operational issue. And this is where HR will come in because HR professionals, people professionals, engage with everyone in the organisation at some point so that they have the opportunity to have that leverage. So, it's often about translating that strategy, and that could be the overall business strategy or the people plan, into what does that mean for individual employees. That's where HR will come in because they engage with people at all levels and throughout their employee lifecycle.\nNC: Okay. Well, that makes sense. Gilda, I mean, let's be clear, sustainability here, we're referring to an organisation reducing the environmental impact of its own operations and, of course, beyond through its supply chain and so on. I mean, most organisations, they've got their ESG metrics, they've got their ambitions. I mean, leaders must know by now that they've got to keep acting on this. And I know your own surveys have shown that. So, in your experience, what's getting in the way of businesses sort of revisiting this and doing better?\nGN: Indeed, we held a survey recently at Chapter Zero Brussels in the director community. And the most important barriers that came out of that survey were, first of all, lack of time and resources, competing priorities on the business, but really, simply, the climate is not being prioritised. A second barrier was the lack of understanding and expertise on the topic within their boards. And, you know, climate, sustainability, these are very, very complex issues that are transdisciplinary and probably require a transformation from many companies in order to survive in the future. You know, you wouldn't have on your board, no one who understands finance, you always have finance expert. So, why don't you have experts in climate change and sustainability's impact on companies? So, that is the second barrier.\nA third barrier is focus on short-term profitability and just not looking out far enough. Let's say that the typical perspective of a company doesn't fit many of the impacts of climate on the companies. And so, they have to begin to look out further than the normal business cycle. And finally, a perceived lack of pressure from stakeholders. And I say perceived because I think there are many board members who still have just not become aware of how rapidly expectations are changing from all of their stakeholders, their investors, their customers, regulators, their own employees. And that has to change. They have to become more aware and supportive.\nNC: Well, Gilda, that's great. That's a really clear explanation there of why organisations are falling short. But Susannah, these are pretty strategic things, aren't they? I mean, if you're talking about, you know, failure to invest in energy saving, changing logistics, all these things. Why then, in spite of what you say about people professionals having these touch points with individuals across organisations, is this really a role for human resources people to get involved? I mean, how do you get involved, particularly at a high level in saying, look, we need to look again at this?\nSH: I think particularly if you're talking about the higher level, as Gilda mentioned, with boards not having the right skills. Actually, this is an area where HR has the expertise in understanding skills, assessing the skills of a team, and the board is just a team. So, I do think there is a possibility for HR to engage with the board and to help discuss, does the board have the skills that it needs, as well as do frontline employees as the workforce, have the relevant skills to deal with climate change and the changes that will happen to the businesses over the next 10 years that they need to be on top of.\nNC: Gilda, I mean, just let's go back to you on that. I mean, in your time sort of looking at this issue in particular, do you find there's a lot of interplay with human resources where there are these deficiencies?\nGN: Absolutely. I think they come in at almost every stage. Because this requires a lot of change in organizations, HR has to be involved, first of all, at the level of educating probably every single person in the company and how can that be done from all of the workers through the board level. It requires changes in the organization, how will that be orchestrated, engineered, how to find the right kinds of people, working maybe with recruiters to find them, how will employees be assessed in the future to work towards this new goal, do they have the right objectives and the right behaviours? There's just so many things that the HR professional needs to be involved in, in addition to supporting their leaders in what kind of culture they want to develop in their companies in the future around these new topics.\nJM: Yes, exactly. I think a lot of the things that Gilda was talking about there are things which HR professionals are already doing. So, I think what's important to think about is this is not about necessarily doing something new, something different, something to layer on what you're already doing, but it's about thinking about, as an HR professional, as a people professional, what do you currently do? Are you involved in recruitment selection? In which case, can you integrate some of those environmental sustainability issues into your processes? So, I think people professionals can look at what is the organization already doing in terms of environmental sustainability and then how, as an HR professional, can I ensure that that's integrated within what I'm already doing? I'm hearing from Gilda a few key words there about change.\nNow, HR professionals should be experts in implementing change, whether that's around organisational design and development or whether it's about implementing change within organisation. I think HR's role is in implementing those things within what's already done. So, you talked about educating people in issues. So, environmental sustainability, climate change. So, that's an L&D role. So, that's partly how do you integrate all of that within what L&D is already doing? So, that could be onboarding, induction, professional development, leadership development. So, it's not doing something new, something different. It's about putting climate change within what you're already doing. Employees are already trained in lots of things. Can we integrate climate change and environmental sustainability knowledge within that? And similarly, I'm thinking about competencies. So, competencies run throughout the employee life cycle from recruitment, job descriptions, person specifications, through performance management and appraisal. So, competencies are a key area. So, if you've already got a competency framework, can you put your sustainability competencies within that framework?\nNC: Jan, while we're with you, just as you're the psychologist, I just got something else I wanted to ask you before we get a bit more into the detail of how HR can get involved. I just want to ask you this. I mean, when Covid hit, I mean, in order to survive the threat of a global pandemic, I mean, the business world, we changed everything we did, didn't we? Where and how people were deployed. The climate threat surely is a lot greater, yet we can hardly say that the response has been so energetic. Are there any kind of reasons for that?\nJM: Yes, yeah. It's really interesting when you look at how people respond to crises. I think the global pandemic was something that we could relate to personally. So, we could see how it could impact us as individuals, our loved ones. We could see the damage that it was causing. It was also a very abrupt crisis, whereas climate change is happening over a longer period of time, and it's hard to see because of temporal and spatial discounting. So, I think the fact that Covid was something we could see impacting on individuals, it was happening quickly. It was also something that we felt was immoral, whereas climate change, unless we reframe it as a health crisis, rather than a climate crisis, people will respond to a health crisis, possibly more than they would respond to a climate crisis.\nNC: That's very interesting. So, I wonder whether that might affect how people sort of get this issue across within organisations. Susannah Haan, you've talked in Outline about how HR people can get involved in this. What is the forum or the process for both getting senior managers to begin initiatives and then galvanise people right down through an organisation?\nSH: Well, I think with senior people, it always, well, all people really, it always makes sense to start the discussion around what are they interested in, what are their drivers? So, part of it is, as Gilda was saying earlier, lack of time resources. What are they concerned about from a business perspective? And then to link your concerns, your engagement around their drivers. So, it may be recruiting enough good people in order to achieve the business goals to expand, to move into new markets. So, then, how can you attract more people? By showing that you are a good employer, that people want to come and work for, etc. So, one of the ways in which people may be attracted to your company is to show that you are a green company, that you are environmentally sustainable. So, that could be one way of engaging with senior management is very much linking back to the business goals.\nNC: And Gilda, how do you get more engagement when you work with companies?\nGN: Maybe I can talk about the actions that can be taken. First and foremost, it's the leadership. And I think that that has to come first and foremost from the CEO and the chair of the board. Because if your leaders take it seriously and say that the company has to change, that's the best way for people to follow. Just assuming you hire a sustainability lead, sustainability officer, and they're going to go and do everything without the senior leadership paying any more attention, it won't happen. So, I think that's a first driver. I talked about education. I think it's only through that, that you start to understand the different consequences of different aspects. And we can't assume that anybody already knows those, even I. I, other experts, constantly learn new things through this because it's so complex. And you want everyone in the company to start understanding that as much as possible.\nI heard Jan use the word integration, and that is really key. And what I wanted to say earlier is this is the area where everybody has to work together. So, you have to integrate it in all of your strategy, all of your processes, all of your businesses, and everybody has to be included. So, HR is a key partner in working together with everyone in the organization through their usual processes. That's absolutely the case. And how do we use those, leverage them for the entire organization together? So, you can integrate it in the company and in your company strategy.\nNC: Susannah Haan, does that strike a chord with you? I know you're sort of working on how the CIPD can sort of continue sort of updating its advice to organisations. I mean, there's an awful lot to do on an awful lot of fronts here.\nSH: There certainly is. A few thoughts, I guess. So, one coming back to the CEO and the chair, so leadership from the top, as Gilda says, you have to have that clarity that this is a priority. Where you have very mixed priorities, it's difficult to get things done. And I think that is another factor when we look at the pandemic is it was a priority for everyone because everyone was affected. The education and leadership development coming down from that, if you want to be a leader in this company, if you want to progress, then climate change is one of the things that needs to be integrated into the leadership development training. Already, it is mentioned as one of the factors in the CIPD's profession map, part of the business acumen standard. So, HR does need to understand the impact of climate change to engage with the business. And then I think really thinking about employee engagement and how you can use existing processes to talk to employees, to engage with employees, to empower employees so that they are engaged and less anxious.\nNC: Well, of course, you can also use a carrot or a stick, Jan Maskell. I was thinking with some of the areas of the business where people managers might be able to sort of up their focus on environmental sustainability. There's the question of the performance reviews, isn't there, a compensation and that is or ought to be based on some kind of sustainability factors.\nJM: Yeah, if you're talking about the relationship between performance and reward and environmental sustainability, absolutely. Organisations need to ensure that their targets for the organisation and down to individuals, the objectives are consistent, so they're all aligned. But also, if you think about environmentally sustainable rewards, you've got to think about, are we rewarding the right things in the right way? One of the key things organisations can look at is their pensions. So, that's often an important reward for people. So, where is the organisation investing its funds? So, is it looking at sustainable investment, which is a really, really important area for organisations and that's, pensions is the one area where HR can have a key role. I also wanted to pick up on something that Gilda said about leadership and Susannah was talking about engagement. I think leadership is an interesting concept in that often we think about leadership as just being what people in senior positions do. But leadership can operate at every level in the organisation if we think about role modelling and ethical decision-making.\nSo, role modelling, if you've got people throughout the organisation who are demonstrating ethical and environmentally sustainable behaviours, they can act as an inspiration for other people. And this is where HR can come in, in terms of the engagement and collaboration and giving employees a voice. I think there are a lot of employees who feel, well, what's the organisation doing about environmental sustainability, because I want to do something, but aren't necessarily being given the voice to do that. And I think that's where leadership can occur throughout the organisation. The whole issue of collaboration, which you talked about, obviously at strategic level, that should happen. So, the whole of the board should be thinking about this and this is where HR can come in and enable that. But also operational level, do we need collaboration across different departments within the organisation, say between facilities management and finance or R&D and HR? So, are we bringing those parts of the organisation together and giving the employees within those parts of the organisation the voice for what they would like to see happen in relation to environmental sustainability and behaviour change?\nNC: Okay. And Gilda, does that chime with your experience? Do you find that people need to be brought together over this?\nGN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, this is completely spot on what Jan has said. And indeed, our young people, if we want to attract them to our companies, they want to be convinced, but they also want to have a say. And I think you have to be open to hearing different suggestions, finding ways to get their voice heard, integrating them into forums that are discussing the different options of the company and bringing those ideas up so that the decisions that are made are taking into account the good ideas of their employees and making them feel they're part of it. These are the things that are going to, you know, you talked about engagement and inspiration in the future and that will make companies more innovative.\nNC: I'm glad you brought up this question of younger people. Susannah, there is this, I think we call it eco-anxiety that a lot of people feel now at an extreme level if they think their company is not being responsible. Of course, they might leave. That'll be a loss to the company. But I wonder whether on a more positive level, that's something that people managers can use to bring people together in some way?\nSH: Absolutely. So, a recent study by the conference board showed that 60% of the respondents want their employers to do more. So, there is the possibility for engagement with employees on these issues. And we have a couple of case studies on our website. I think Deloitte did some engagement with its employees to make sustainability part of everyone's job and to embed sustainability initiatives into the organisation. So, there are good examples out there that people can look at and copy.\nNC: And Jan Maskell, we were hearing there from Susannah about eco-anxiety. Is that something that you think about too?\nJM: Yeah, I think as a psychologist, I'm obviously interested in this issue. I think organisations have a role in terms of looking after the health and wellbeing of their employees, but also in terms of carrying out risk assessments. So, are there any roles that might particularly be susceptible to the impacts from climate change? And to consider those health issues, not only for employees, but through the supply chain as well. And it's interesting that HR in their CIPD professions map has some of these issues already covered in terms of cultural behaviour, talk about enabling resilience. So, I think that's something that's really important for HR professionals to think about is the health and wellbeing of their employees.\nNC: I suppose, Jan, the danger is that sometimes it's easier to do the small things, isn't it? It's to get rid of disposable cups. It's a lot harder to do things which are not seen and are difficult.\nJM: I think you're absolutely right. And a lot of organisations might focus on, you know, switching from plastic straws to paper straws, whereas they're not looking at their whole supply chain and the scope one, two and three emissions and how they could reduce all of those. But there's also a place for doing those small things. And this is where sometimes within HR, you might look at this and go, this is all too big for me to deal with. Well start with something small and then something visible. And those who are interested and engaged in managing change will know that some of those quick wins can have a big impact, but they need to be seen within a bigger picture of are we dealing with this strategically and right throughout the organisation down to operational level. So, yes, I think you're absolutely right. Don't ignore doing the small things, but make sure they're all part of a bigger picture as well.\nNC: Now, I noticed there you threw in some of the sort of basic terminology of the sustainability drive with scopes one, two and three, which we won't go into. People can look them up, but essentially describing levels of work that you can do. And of course, there is the basic concept of net zero. Gilda, do you think everybody in an organisation needs to understand all this? Because it can get quite technical. Not everybody reads the kind of documents you would when working with boards. How much understanding would you say you need about the sort of processes of reducing environmental impact, decarbonising in order to do it effectively?\nGN: I think so much of what people need to learn is pretty basic. It's about basic science and nature and being aware of what's happening in our environment. And I honestly recommend for everyone in the organisation, starting at the board, but every employee in the organisation should have that possibility to learn about the science, which is, again, very basic, and yet so many people don't know. So, I do think that those are the foundations of what everyone needs to understand. It's very different from what has been done in business until now, but it will become so important to the future of their companies and the environment that they will have to navigate in the future. And so, I do think we need to start with the basics. So, every area, little by little, needs to also receive the more complex training that fits their role and the challenges that they need to meet. But at a basic level, I indeed feel that everyone in the organisation needs some sort of supportive training.\nNC: And there was a good statistic, I think, Susannah, you picked this out, I found it online, to really demonstrate what it takes to make a difference. I think you quoted from one survey, this is organisations that have been successful in taking climate actions. 70% have upskilled their existing board members and 60% have actually changed the composition of their board. Now, that's quite a big thing, isn't it?\nSH: That's a very big thing, actually, which comes back to the earlier discussion we were having on skills and particularly of senior managers and board members. And I think there is a challenge here about whether the boards that we have now are set up in order to meet the challenges externally that they face. And there are quite a few surveys coming along saying that CEOs and so on are questioning whether their company will still be around in 10 years, whether they have the right people in their teams, whether they are set up for success.\nNC: Gosh, well, that's pretty far reaching. And I just wonder why there is inaction, you know, in the light of that. I mean, Jan, is this down to motivation, managing mindsets, just feeling overwhelmed because of that possibility of the company, you might feel the company is not going to be there anymore. I just wonder whether incentives would help. I mean, can HR devise anything clever here?\nJM: I think you've touched on a number of reasons. There are any number of reasons why organisations might resist taking action. I think it's back to something that we were talking about earlier, about aligning these decisions to what's important for individuals. And incentives are a really tricky area to go into. How would you incentivise someone to take environmental action? And I think it's appealing to the things that are important to them. So, if you can point out that this climate change is having a real impact on our supply chain, so what are the impacts of that? Personally, I would resist incentives and just talk about how can we enable and encourage people to take action through the sort of education that Gilda was talking about. It's interesting, once people understand some of that basic science and then look at what's the potential impact of climate change on my organisation, but also what impact is my organisation having on climate change?\nSo it's that two-way process. They can start to think about, yes, it was interesting, my organisation might not exist in 10 years' time. Do I care? Well, yes, I might do. Am I going to do something about it? What do I need to do to enable it to survive? So you're thinking about organisational sustainability. So, is it going to survive the issues? So, about mitigation and adaptation, what actions can we take now to address the issues of the climate crisis? But then also thinking, well, a lot of these things are going to happen because we get into those tipping points. What can we do to adapt to them? So, I think sometimes just the education piece is sufficient to incentivise people to take action. Yeah, very often what I hear in organisations is, oh, we can't afford to do that, to which I would say, well, what's going to be the impact if you don't do that? What's going to be the financial impact now and in the future if you don't do that?\nNC: Absolutely. And to try and avoid at all costs, Gilda, just this kind of greenwashing everybody's familiar with where some rather small win is exaggerated, made a big fuss of and we were just chatting beforehand and you came up with, I thought, a rather interesting explanation of why it is that organisations sometimes overplay really something which is not a big deal.\nGN: Well, you know, the question of greenwashing, I mean, clearly it's to enhance their image, knowing that everyone's looking at this and maybe trying to find a quick way through a couple of small initiatives, as we were talking about earlier, you know, the conversion of plastic straws to paper straws. In Belgium, you know, there's still company cars. OK, we're going to switch them all to electric and then we're done with it. And that's not a real effort. What I found interesting in the survey that we did, is that when you haven't explored and you don't know, you have no ideas. And if you're not taking a holistic approach to it, you might not see what it really means for your organisation. What we found through the Chapter Zero survey was that companies that began to work together to explore what are their most important impacts and areas of their company that are being impacted or might be impacted by climate change and started actually working through. So, what does that mean? What do we do? The higher the percentage of companies said that they actually believed that taking actions would save their company money rather than it being too much of a cost now. So, in other words, the more aware you become, the less you're greenwashing and you're actually finding ways that this makes your company more efficient.\nNC: As we sort of try and draw this together then, I just wonder if I can come around to each of you and ask you to just sort of boil down some of the many things we've talked about to things that organisations can and should be doing immediately. Susannah?\nSH: I do think that having a look at whether you have the skills at the top is very important, as well as skills throughout the workforce.\nNC: Short and sweet and right to the point. Jan?\nJM: I think a thing you can do immediately is look at what you're already doing. So, what's already happening in the organisation, that could be in terms of policies, procedures, accreditation. So, what's your current practice and how can you integrate sustainability practices into what you're already doing?\nNC: Right. So get more bang for your buck. And Gilda?\nGN: Mine would be to immediately set up some sort of first education session for your board to get things started.\nNC: Okay. Well, lots of good advice there. A lot more resources on this from Jan and others on the CIPD website. I think we certainly concluded environmental sustainability is an issue for people, professionals. But I think, as we've heard, it's all about re-examining every responsibility for its climate implications, giving people the confidence, the skills and permission to make changes that bring those measurable results.

      "full_text": "Duration: 35:11\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: From hiring and nurturing staff to having to tell them things they might not want to hear, people professionals have to do it all. But what does it take to make a great one? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNow here's a question to start the new year. Do you have to be a people person to be an effective HR manager? What are the ideal qualities for the job? Because over the years the professions morph from managing employee paperwork to being a multifunctional key player in an organisation's success. But there are core skills, traits and qualities that may go to make an HR all-rounder, juggling everything from new hires, handling absenteeism and championing your people, their well-being, equity, diversity and inclusion. And what a range of skills you need to manage today's scattered workforces. The confidence to use data and social media, to know when to take a moral lead or say no even to leaders.\nWell, to find out if today's ideal people professional is a mythical creature, a unicorn in HR clothing, we've a tip-top line-up. Like unicorns the best podcast panels are hard to catch but we've managed to lasso from Willow HR, a self-confessed strategic and rebellious thinker with 20 years international experience and she's a keen amateur kickboxer. Maybe not a core requirement in HR but you never know, it's Laura Callaghan.\nLaura Callaghan: Hi there Nigel.\nNC: From New Cross Healthcare Solutions, a chief people officer who's led HR teams in numerous private and public organisations to reap the benefits of better technology, AI and design improvements, it's David Balls. Hello.\nDavid Balls: Hi there Nigel. And someone who's done more thinking than almost anyone about the role of the HR professional in the new world of work, which also happens to be the title of his new book. He says the essential skills for HR professionals are profoundly human in nature.\nNC: It's the CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese. Hello.\nPeter Cheese: Hello Nigel.\nNC: So Peter, I mean it doesn't take a genius to work out, which is probably how I managed to do it, that I mean the list of skills or competencies that you need to progress in the HR profession have kind of grown like topsy as the reach of HR itself has increased.\nPC: Yeah I think that's true because the context in which we're operating in many ways is becoming more complex. We're talking about all sorts of different variables, social change, different generational expectations. Obviously we've been going through something of an economic crisis, cost of living crisis and of course very big drivers of change like technology which is forcing us to adapt and think differently and create organisations which are agile. And in all of that, that does create this bigger space for our profession to operate and I always look at that from one perspective which I think is exciting, which is that it is a space where we can make such a difference to the future of organisations and people's jobs and careers.\nBut on the other hand of course it does bring with it some challenges and there's no doubt as we look at the profession today and as we survey certainly the senior profession, we're very consistently hearing these worries about all the pressure that the profession does feel because we're also not immune of course to things like cost saving and cost cutting ourselves and having to deal with all of those issues across organisations. So, as I said I think the context is driving a lot of this without doubt. I think it's a very good time to be in the profession but we've got to make sure that we're supporting each other through our community, through our learning, through our investment in ourselves to deal with the challenges that we're facing.\nNC: And Peter puts the emphasis at the end there on human abilities. I'm sure we'll touch on plenty of those in the next half hour or so. David, when we had a quick chat before the podcast you were zooming in on the paramount need for people professionals to begin with a commercial head on them. So, being great at the job in your view then stems from understanding the business rather than a list of attributes.\nDB: Absolutely Nigel. I think the key for any HR professional is they've got to really embed themselves in the organisation and using Peter's word understand the context that they're operating in and I think it's then about how do they apply their knowledge, their expertise, their people lens if that's a better phrase, to the particular problems that they're facing and I think that flows all the way through. I think it's not just about embedding themselves in the organisation as much as looking at how technology is influencing their organisation and how that applies to their particular people problems, the cultures that they're operating in with flexible work and they might be looking at the hybrid models that they're looking at and really understanding them in their own context and then how does their particular knowledge, their particular understanding of their people, their people practice or their area can be brought to bear on those particular issues.\nNC: But I mean David do you really see HR people performing without much business understanding? I mean if that's the case what is it like in terms of how they prioritise or do the job?\nDB: Well I think it's I don't see people not having that understanding Nigel. I think it's about the balance which is yeah we are an organisation or a group I must say sort of seen as a social conscience of an organisation at any one moment in time and I think that's important that people, the people function does that someone's got to do it and we've got to do that. But I think it's then understanding how you operate like that in a particular business environment and the only way you're ever going to do that is if you understand the business context so, you've got to get those balance rights and there will be difficult times where those two are diametrically opposed or coming to conflict, you know the difference between a whistle-blower and a grievance. You know one is fundamental it's got to be raised the board, it's got to be dealt with, that is what we are here to deal to deal with versus the other one is maybe a very localised issue that the HR person needs to go away and sort at a local level.\nBut yeah there again, I think you've got to understand the context and you've got to understand what you're dealing with and you've got to understand what you're expected to do in those circumstances, to really understand the right questions to ask to get to the root of the problem to probably differentiate between what is a fundamental business issue or something that is just a grievance, a local issue that can be dealt with in a much more subtle or easier way.\nNC: Okay so to get to the bottom of some of those problems, Laura clearly you're going to need some core skills we can start talking about those now and let's get this out of the way first. I mentioned at the beginning do you need to be a people person?\nLC: That was something that I was considering a few months back and that created a social post on that and looking at some of those things of what a people person was actually defined to be around kind of being somebody who's very friendly, somebody who's very talkative, somebody who's very sociable. In actual fact, I think that we do genuinely practice what we preach within HR around diversity and inclusion and there are HR roles and organisations for all sorts of different people. You don't have to be an extrovert, you don't have to be a chatty person.\nNC: What about just being likable because that's associated with being a people person? I mean unless you sit in a back room and just sort of doing job design or interpreting analytics, I mean you're going to have to have those difficult conversations with people aren't you?\nLC: Well, exactly that but I think then when it comes to being likable is if we enter into discussions and initiatives with the aim of being likable, we're not going to necessarily get down to the hard conversations, the tough decisions that have to be made and unfortunately in HR, we are part of a lot of things that may not always have positive consequences for people and so being likable unfortunately is not one of my priorities. Being fair, being consistent and making sure we are human that's far more important and let's face it, if somebody's making redundancy decisions you're not going to like them kind of regardless of their personality so, it just it shouldn't be part of the agenda.\nDB: I think Laura you raise an excellent point there. I think it goes back to another question which is what is the people characteristics that people are supposed to have because I think some of the time in our role, we're going to have to have really difficult conversations with people and sometimes that is going to be, you're not right for this organization or you're not right for this role, and people aren't going to necessarily like you at the end of that, right. They don't like to sometimes have those conversations but if we are going to be compassionate, if we are going to be supportive, if we are going to be creating meaningful work and meaningful jobs for people and meaningful environments for people. We sometimes have to have that.\nSo, I think it's very, it's the key question there is what are, you know, what do we what do, we class as the people traits that are important because I think likability is certainly something people want and would aspire to be, you know, we don't go out of our way to be unlikable but at some points you're going to have to say things and do things people might not like but it's a very compassionate thing to do.\nLC: And HR can be a really lonely place as well sometimes because we've got to maintain that professional distance so when I look at the various different teams across all of the clients that I'm really embedded with is that they cannot be considered friends because we have to maintain professional distance to make independent decisions and advising and influencing people on what the right thing is to do. And we can't be, we can't be, tainting that with personal relationships and so we've always got to kind of be that person slightly to the side.\nPC: I think sometimes this conversation has got a bit confused about how the function and profession itself is perceived, I mean unfortunately when you look at you know popularity ratings of different functions across businesses, HR doesn't generally figure anywhere close to the top half it's often seen as a function which too many people would regard as, it's control and it's about you know computer says no or whatever. And I absolutely agree with what Laura and David said it's not about individually being likable but the function itself, it's more about being respected and in order to be respected we've got to make sure, as we've already said, that we're focused on the business outcomes, that we're being fair and that we bring evidence and data to the conversation. So, that we can be seen to be fair and transparent on what we're doing and I think those are the things that help to create a function and profession which is respected and can influence, which is really what we're talking about here and not focus so much on this this construct of likability.\nNC: Peter, I also see the CIPD's produced this professional map an international standard developed with 20,000 people professionals and purpose sits in the centre you've got values core knowledge and behaviours empathy and emotional intelligence and that is quite a useful thing to see but I think it's sometimes quite difficult to kind of match desirable qualities with actually how the job works out day to day.\nPC: Yeah I mean, the profession map obviously is a really important part of how we think about the capabilities and behaviours of people professionals and as you said, at the heart of it, is this notion of purpose and I think you know, certainly in recent years there's been so much more conversation about, what is the purpose of the business or the function or indeed ourselves individually. And the thing that I find very exciting about our purpose as a profession, is it is can be very profound. I mean, we talk about the idea of championing better work and working lives. So, it has an organisational and business purpose but it also has beyond that which I think attracts a lot of people into it. A wider social purpose as well, if we see our role as helping create great organisations with great cultures that are inclusive, support people and deliver business outcomes through productivity and all these other things, then that's good for everybody, it's good for individuals, it's good for businesses and it's certainly good for the economy and society more broadly.\nSo, I think anchoring on that idea of purpose is really important and then as you touched on Nigel around that we very much talk about a couple of core principles one is that everything we think about should be led by principles, it should be evidence-based and it should be outcomes driven. And then you're into this sort of idea of what we would just describe as core knowledge and behaviours and that's before we've even got into all the different specialist areas, if you will of the profession and a lot of the core behaviours are very much around the things we talked about. So, being able to exercise judgment, being able to influence, being able to think ethically, being able to think holistically and understand situations and contexts. I would also add to that and I think it's a very important attribute of HR professionals in today's world, is curiosity and that desire to keep learning because the reality is, as we've already touched on the world of work is changing very fast and I really really believe our profession has a profound role to play in shaping the future of work and so, we've got to be curious, we've got to understand. We don't need to be experts on all these things but be asking the right questions, I think as David said on things like technology and artificial intelligence and all these sorts of things.\nSo, we very much do anchor the thinking about what it means to be an HR professional around these ideas of, centred on purpose, centred on things like core knowledge and core behaviours and incidentally in the core knowledge it talks very much about business acumen and understanding. Before you get into all of the things that you layer on top, in terms of specialisms and areas of professional competence and job competence, we know we all need.\nLC: Unfortunately, I've actually been in HR now for 20 years which I can't believe, I've been doing anything for 20 years but we've gone from being a people focused function of a business where employees perhaps had a consideration that we were there for them. And then as Peter says, what we've actually shifted now is to part of a strategic driver within an organisation which is around what are the business outcomes or organisational objectives, if it's not a private sector organisation. So, what is the organisation trying to achieve and therefore what is the right thing to do here right now. And sometimes unfortunately, that means that there can be detrimental impact on staff members whether that be restructures or reshaping and those kind of things but what we have to consider is that, the organisation needs to achieve its aims and how are we going to do that.\nSo, purpose of HR is to support an organisation to achieve its organisational objectives through its people and therefore what does that mean for them and in keeping with the foundations of ethical behaviour, fairness and consistency. So, that shift of attitude towards us being there to sort out people's issues, to being a strategic driver, really I think there's still a bit of confusion for some employees as to what our purpose is within some organisations I've come across certainly.\nNC: And of course, being a strategic driver David Balls means focusing on the organisation's business performance, what do you need for that in your view?\nDB: Well, I think you actually go back to what Peter said earlier. I think a lot of those traits that we're talking about are pretty consistent across any person who wants to be a senior leader in any department in any organisation, you know, being able to exercise judgment, being ethical, understanding how technology can influence their department or influence what they are doing. You know using data, being thoughtful, you know all of those great things are fairly ubiquitous. I think across good senior leaders and I just don't think the people function is any different. I think what they've got to do is be all of those things but then have the expertise and the understanding of people and whether that be from a psychological perspective or you know they're into a reward perspective or into a cultural change perspective, but be able to bring all of those skills that we've talked about and apply their knowledge and expertise to the particular business problem they've got. You know, as someone in finance would understand a particular regulation or a particular standard that would then apply that knowledge to their particular context.\nNC: And Laura technology and AI loom increasingly large in day-to-day HR work and numeracy and tech skills are really needed aren't they? Some people find it hard to adapt to that aspect of today's working world.\nLC: Absolutely and so I feel as though to be a to be a senior HR professional now that numeracy but also that commercial awareness and David talked about this right at the top of the session, that every single person within any organisation within any function, within any team, needs to understand, what is our purpose, what is our product, who are you here to sell it to, what's our environmental context, our market context and those kind of things because as HR professionals, we are never going to build trust within an organisation if we can't talk with some authority around what its meaning for existence is, down to all the way down to how can you possibly interview a candidate if you weren't able to answer those kind of basic questions. But then you know, we've also now need to make sure that as senior professionals we're able to be strategic, with strategic thinkers we're able to be analytical, we're able to be able to work budgets, those are absolutely critical skills that you can learn and that you can acquire through experiences. So, those don't tend to be those kind of like fundamental traits that's things that we learn as we rise up through an organisation.\nAnd so, what we also then see is great generational differences, we've got people who are growing up with these technologies, people who are able to adopt and adapt to these technologies really, really easily. And I feel like that's one of our super strengths within HR roles, is that we because it's in our DNA already to think about, right who do we need to bring into the room, to be able to give us that guidance and advice and so what I see quite frequently is generational differences between decision makers that sit at the top of the organisation and the skills and the expectations also of those who are perhaps at the team member level. And bringing those people to understand what are the expectations, what are the skills and what can those people bring in with the business leaders and those who aren't ultimately the decision makers. And so, not kind of feeling as though there's that where, only the decision makers have the capability to know what to do in any given situation and to bring forwards that the skills of other people in the team and other people in the organisation.\nNC: Sure and those HR capabilities Peter Cheese often involve translating an organisation's goals or mission into actual fulfilling work for people, from changing how work's done, who's doing it and there's then this phrase that grates on me a bit ,you know, helping people to be their best selves. Can you just sort of talk a bit about this new world of work and the role that HR people can play and the qualities that they're going to need?\nPC: Yeah absolutely, I think this goes back to what we see as the purpose of profession in a very broad sense, this idea of championing better work and working lives and the reality is, if you look at work today and indeed in, I suppose more or less the history of work. So, it hasn't always been fulfilling there are many people who are very stressed, are disadvantaged at work, not using their skills effectively, feel disengaged and unmotivated. There are endless surveys that talk to these sorts of things and I really strongly believe that we have to design work consciously for the future, in ways that does create jobs, that are good for people, because work should be good for us. We spend a lot of time doing it, it should be driven by a sense of purpose and we understand that purpose and aligns to our beliefs and values and so on. But it is also using our skills, it's also good and supportive for our well-being and many of these constructs have actually been understood for a long time.  You know, the idea of job quality. What are those attributes of good work?\nWhat is encouraging is, there is a lot more discussion about those ideas and it's coming through even in the sort of public discourse, if you will. So, the ideas of good employment charters things of that nature which we've seen emerging across different parts of the country in which we're very supportive of, as the CIPD because this is central, as I said to, I think our profession and really anchoring our thinking of the future about, all right let's build. And it really is about constructing jobs particularly with the impact of technology now and the role that our profession has in constructing jobs and the organisations and cultures that sit around them that fulfill those ideas of what good work really is, and how it therefore can be good for all of us. It can be inclusive, it's good for our well-being and so on. And again, we have a massive opportunity, as a profession to lead the way on so much of that debate and then finally on your point about helping people to be their best selves. Yeah, it's a bit of a clunky expression but it but it does sort of capture that idea that, don't we all want to try to be our best selves, don't we all want to you know, have that opportunity to grow and develop and achieve something meaningful.\nAnd as I said, work is a very important way in which we do that and it's so important now that, we create that that sense of purpose, that sense of meaning, fulfilling work and work that is good for us. And it's not least because that is what, I think the generations coming into work now are far more articulate about demanding. I mean, when I first started work, we didn't talk about these things very much. We just did work and we had to sort of suck it up, as it were. I think you know, the generations now generation y and generation z, are very much more focused on these ideas and so they should be and we should work together to create a future that is ultimately good for all of us in that regard.\nNC: And I wonder David to what extent an organisation that has meaning, as we've just heard from Peter needs to think a lot about culture which is another word which perhaps wasn't talked about 20 years ago. As somebody practical who sort of deals with real situations in companies, does culture ranked very highly with you?\nDB: Yeah I look, I think cultures are incredibly important but I think again and I'm going to come back to something Peter's saying, I think, I think, the challenge with all of this is, you start to talk in amorphous terms. And actually when you distil cultures down they are about those individual transactions that happen on a daily basis and Peter was saying they're about meaningful work and charters. I'm not sure they're the ideal route to go down. I think the profession should be encouraging meaningful debates between what we are classed as business people or business managers or whatever, whatever terminology you want to use and the individuals. Because that meaningful work will come from an individual saying this is what I want to do, this is what I bring to the table, this is what I'm committed to give, this is what I believe and this is what I value. And the organisation has got to make a decision at that point in time, whether they can create the right environment for that person to be successful. Sometimes they can, sometimes they can work, sometimes they can't but my point is that it's encouraging that two-way dialogue.\nLC: And I'd echo exactly that David and I think especially since the last recession, where we've had you know for over 10, you know, nearly 15 years of people who have joined the world of work, where job security is just simply not a thing. It is not an expectation on either side, it's not talked about it's just not part of our world anymore. And so we have to be able to have conversations about mutually beneficial relationships and I say this, I preach this to businesses all the time, this is like one of the key, the key things I think absolutely critical is that we have to be able to articulate explicitly what is in it for the employee. What do we expect from them, we're really, we're quite familiar and very comfortable with those conversations. We have to talk about what they get in return. Because as Peter says these generations, they are expecting something from this. And so, we if we can't describe to them and say right this is where we're going and this is what you get out of it. They will simply not join us on that journey.\nDB: I would just say on the back of that though, I think very, very important is organisations feeling and knowing that they can say no.\nNC: But we're talking here in the context of what the professionals can do to be ideal in their jobs to grow how do they bring an influence to bear on these quite difficult issues sometimes?\nLC: And we're coaching, we're coaching those managers and those business leaders that when somebody comes across and says well, this is great, I can, I can be this, this role in your organisation but this is what I expect in return. So, whether that be a salary that kind of goes outside what the organization is comfortable with, or to attend training that's kind of not within the budgets and those kind of things like. We are now as Peter has said there are generations that are very happy to ask and ask but equally that there is, we have to be comfortable to say, that's not something that we can offer you and so David's earlier point around well, there comes a point which we have to say what actually your values and our values, are what you need and what we can offer, simply don't meet. That's something that we have to encourage and coach and develop managers to be happy and comfortable to have those conversations.\nNC: Peter Cheese, if I can just bring you to another important question which is that not all HR people progress in their jobs do they? They get to a certain point, they don't become influencers within their organisation, maybe they're not very good at doing that kind of pushing back, with senior managers sometimes that we talked about. Not great at the harder conversations. Can you retrain yourself do you think to reach a higher level if you feel you've come to some kind of impasse?\nPC: I suppose my reaction to that is that's again a very broad question that would apply to any function or profession it's not and there's nothing unique about that to HR but I think as we've all explored that the reality of our profession is we do have to be good at influencing and communicating. We have to deliver difficult messages sometimes, we have to challenge sometimes as Laura said we sometimes have to challenge senior management on things and what I've also found over the years with the profession of course, is if I compare it to finance and accounting, finance and accounting is very rule driven. If something's not right, I can tell you it's not right and you can't do that and if you carry on doing that you're going to be in trouble. HR of course, has a legal foundation but it's much less sort of rules and regulatory driven in that sense and secondly, I think everybody has a view in HR, right. Now not everybody will have a view on finance but everybody has a view on HR. So, in that context it does mean I think in particular perhaps for our profession our ability to influence, to deal with conflict and difficult conversations and balance perspectives, we've got to both champion the workforce as well as champion the business and management pragmatism and priorities.\nAnd those are quite challenging things to do and therefore to grow through the profession up to these more senior levels. Those ability that the skills we called out, things like the ability to influence, communicate clearly, critical thinking evidence-based practice understanding business, are really, really essential and and all of those things to answer your core question. Yeah, you can absolutely develop and train those things. Now one other quick point I would make is, I think we also need to think about in developing those skills and capabilities, we don't just need to do them by saying, you need to stay in HR, never move from HR. I think some of the best teams I see now, really are more fungible in terms of bringing people into HR from other areas of business and maybe move back into other areas of business and they're bringing with them that HR understanding and vice versa. And I think we can do more to develop some of these capabilities by being a bit more fungible and how we think about HR expertise and how we grow the function for the future.\nLC: And I think also, I've seen some really fantastic HR professionals who, can they train to have those skills to have the difficult conversations and to be that level of independence and the and the conscience and the critical frame. Yes, every person will be able to train to, be able to do those things. However, not every organisation is wanting that out of HR and I think there's a level to which we have to also accept that the evolution of HR isn't complete. And we are continuing to be on a journey and there are some organisations that are further evolved than others and therefore if a HR professional listening to this feels like, do you know what, I'm doing everything I can and I'm still not succeeding. Go and get a job in another organisation, it's not necessarily on you, it could be on them.\nNC: Comes down to what David was saying at the beginning about understanding the business.\nPC: Well, I mean actually yes it was going to sort of reflect exactly that point we talked a lot about our profession understand the business. But we've got to educate business to understand what strategic HR is and very much to Laura's point. I mean, that so the reality yes what you're describing therefore is also to some degree what I've seen with people, they almost hit a ceiling within their organization because they want to be acting in this much more strategic way. But they're not being always given the opportunity because the business leaders don't understand what strategic HR is.\nNow, that to me is always the question about what we need to do also as a professional to educate business leaders much more on these questions. I mean, we talk for example, about culture and yet many business leaders really struggle to understand that. We don't teach enough about it business schools, I've been and spoken to many MBA programs for example, we talk about all these fantastic things like finance, strategy and things of that nature. But we don't talk about things like people's strategies and cultural understanding and organisational dynamics and those sorts of things, really should be seen as important business skills, that business people need to have. And then we find a we will find and we're part of that process, a much easier connection with business leaders so that we can grow the profession and grow those strategic capabilities which we aspire to in the more senior levels of the profession.\nNC: OK, so if we're thinking about that in practice David Balls, I was thinking maybe the times when you go into an organisation and try and make it work better. Where does that relate to what the individual HR people are doing and what their skills are?\nDB: Well, I think I said this earlier about things like cultures being this amorphous term. I think the big thing about it is you've got to break it down into what does it mean and the behaviour that you're going to demonstrate at any one moment in time. Now, a culture will guide that but each a culture you can hide behind a term about the culture and I think, what we've got to get HR people doing and indeed other business leaders around the entire organisation, is thinking about what they are doing in their interactions and what does that say about the type of business they want to be and the culture they're trying to create. Because you know, it only takes you know, one interaction where it is counter cultural to start to make people think well this isn't the right place for me. Yeah, this is not what I expect, this is not what I signed up to, so, I think it's really those those individuals, thinking about the behaviours that they're going to demonstrate in any one interaction, which has got to be aligned to the culture they're trying to create.\nNC: OK, well we want to try and bring this to some kind of conclusion so, I was wondering in the light of all that Laura, can a people manager really be like a Swiss army knife, you know deployable in every single situation or to what extent is it okay to prioritize your skills in line with what particular HR work you're doing?\nLC: Yeah, absolutely we've got to be able to flex and in any particular situation is this is the emotional intelligence is that, what does this situation require of me. What is our objective and how are we going to make sure we elicit the right responses out of people. So, sometimes that can be, that kind of like that tough straight talking direct version of you and sometimes it can be somebody who's going to be far more um empathetic. And take a much longer time and there's many different ways in which but we have got to be able to respond to what the situation requires of us. And to be tuned in to that situation and the needs of those people in the room. And so, if you're dealing with those kind of the business leaders then we've got to be able to be direct, we've got to make sure we can make our point and we've got to be able to influence in that room quickly, we've got to demonstrate those expertise. But with our with team member populations, they're going to need taking on the journey. They're going to need kind of guiding through, so we can be many things to many different people as long as we're being authentic. That's a bit that shines through very quickly is if you're not bringing your authentic self then that's that's very difficult to hide from.\nNC: And we're talking here about the ideal qualities for an HR person so, final thought there from David and Peter. David first.\nDB: The ideal HR person I think we go full circle to where we started which is, I don't think it needs to be about this gregarious extroverted likeable wonderful unicorn person, you even referenced in your introduction it just that doesn't exist. Clearly as any professional in any organisation you want to do the things that people and Peter said earlier respect you for doing. And I think as long as people can go into those conversations, I keep coming back to these single interactions and thinking about you know, the right the right sort of tone they want to sell. The right melody they want to create in their organisation and have the right impact, using the right data points, the right information to just. Yeah that's what you've got to ask of a good HR person is just, think about the context that you're in. Think about the interaction that you're having and just putting your best foot forward and using those skills that you've got and data that's around you to take the best most respectable path forward.\nNC: And Peter Cheese\nPC: Yeah, I think it's been well said and well explored through this podcast. I would go back to things like this sense of curiosity. I would certainly also talk about this idea of purpose and a lot of things that we talked about which are I think very well embedded in our profession map. But also you know I think this is a very exciting time for the profession. Yes, it is definitely challenging but I think certainly my view. We have a clear line of sight as to what the real value that we add to organisations is now. Almost more than ever before. The context we're in is about a lot of change, a lot of adaptation, a lot of discussions about skills, about culture, about you know, responsible business, ethical behaviours, impact to technology and all of these are very very critical themes. As I said before not just for organisations but ultimately for our economists and our societies. And this is what I think our profession can really, really contribute to and I think that is very, very exciting. So, I would like to encourage people of course, to come into the profession.\nYou know, recognising as we've all said, there is not one single model for what you need to be, to be a good HR professional and indeed many of the things and attributes we've talked about will apply to good business people in general. But I think that sense of purpose and belief in what we do and why it's important, that sense of curiosity and you know finally I think a little bit of resilience as well because I said it is important to recognize that with all this stuff happening, there is a lot of pressure on the profession and we do have to deal with some difficult stuff alongside you know, the inspiring and future-driven things. And that also I think, calls for a little bit of resilience and courage as well.\nNC: Well, what a thoughtful start to the new year for the podcast. Many thanks there.

      "summary": "Learning professionals may not be asked to ‘show me the money’, but they will be expected to demonstrate value and return on investment. So, what can learning professionals do to best set themselves up for success? Could the answer lie in simply asking the right questions to properly diagnose an organisation’s real learning need?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Natalie Richer, Natalie Richer Consulting; Payal Gaglani-Bhatt, Chief People Officer at The Little Gurus; and Steve George, Interim Head of Learning and Development at CIPD, as we explore how learning professionals can ask the right questions to better understand and diagnose the real learning requirement for your organisation or client.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 29:40\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: When learning fails to hit the spot, here's how to do it better by asking the right questions first. I am Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNow, planning on running a course before you really know what people need to learn sounds crazy and a waste of your organisation's money yet it's all too common. It's only after all those feedback forms have been collected and business life goes on, the penny drops that all those custom-designed, state of the art, digital training has failed to boost skills and people performance as it was meant to. So, this month, how to set up your learning and development for success by asking the right questions before diving into your planning.\nWe've got three wise learning and development heads here, all with thoughts and ideas to help you, hopefully, get better bangs for your learning bucks.\nNatalie Richer is a consultant with over 20 years' experience designing and delivering learning solutions on a range of topics including performance management so I'd better watch out. Hi, Natalie.\nNatalie Richer: Hi.\nNC: From the home team, a welcome return to podcast for Steve George who has a background in cognitive psychology and is now CIPD'S interim Head of Learning. Hello, Steve.\nSteve George: Hi there, Nigel. Good to see you again.\nNC: And we have the Chief People Officer from Little Gurus, a consultancy in Dubai in the Middle East. She says she's on a mission to give HR a makeover, it's Payal Gaglani-Bhatt, welcome.\nPayal Gaglani-Bhatt: Thank you very much for having me, Nigel. Hi.\nNC: So, Payal, just before we get stuck into all the good stuff, the advice, can you talk us through maybe one or two typical situations where L&D, kind of, gets the cart before the horse, where you just fail to ask the right questions or the wrong ones before you start?\nPGB: I'd like to start out by saying have you ever been to the doctor, gone there and said to the doctor 'can you give me headache medicine?' as your opening statement? That's what we often hear within HR and L&D. People will come to the L&D department within organisations and say 'I want to run a time management course' or 'I want to run something on team building' and this is the solution. It's not really understood, it's just a feeling, sometimes a gut feeling and that's where people come in. Now, I'll give you a recent example; one of my recent clients came to me saying we want to run a time management programme. I said brilliant, okay, tell me more and they said yeah, our team is not able to really meet the deadlines and they are not able to achieve what we want out of them within the strict SLAs that we have and I said that's fair enough, what would you like them get at the end of it. They were like we just want them to work together a little bit better. So, the ideal situation would have been let's think about a time management programme, let's think about some strategies to improve their time management skills, so on and so forth. Having said that though, a few more questions reviewed what the actual problem was. I'm going to leave it at a cliff-hanger there and wait for my colleagues to say what else have they experienced.\nNC: Well, we're getting a strong feeling there that often, people ask for one thing but there are much deeper underlying issues. Steve George, I mean, I just wonder how learning teams usually, typically diagnose the needs for learning, for training. I mean, it sounds like from what Payal says, there are, kind of, maybe drawbacks with the traditional way things used to be done.\nSG: Absolutely. So, there's that traditional learning needs analysis approach which looks at learning as the solution for the problem. So, I love Payal's example. I've had similar myself where going into a client and they've got some business partners, for example, who are underperforming as business partners so they want business partner training and you ask the questions and you discover what they actually need, the skills that they need to build are more organisation design, for example. So, it's very much uncovering that what people think they need doesn't necessarily solve the problem that they're looking to solve. So, that traditional learning needs analysis can sometimes be based on subjective information so you don't necessarily get to the core of what the problem is. It can sometimes rely on people being open about their own performance gaps and, if that's the case, people may not want to reveal them because they're not sure what that might lead to, so what the outcome is of them talking about their gaps. It can also fall foul of limited documentation. So, your reliance on other people in the organisation performing that consultancy work and identifying what the barriers to performance are. So, traditional learning needs analysis has its place, perhaps, but it's limited within the context of what we're talking about here.\nNC: Well. So, Natalie Richer, I am already getting the sense here that life is going to start getting more complicated once you start asking these questions. You're going to have to start responding to what you hear and, really, you have to challenge people all over the show.\nNR: Yeah, I think challenge is an interesting word. I think you have to do it carefully. I like the examples we've already heard but quite often, I'm approached with a learning solution and asked to execute it. A bit like an order-taker, we want this solution and here's the date and here's the number of people and my job is to very gently challenge whether the solution they have in mind will fix the problem maybe they haven't shared yet. So, my role is to very carefully do some questioning and sometimes that involves building trust and building rapport before I can do that.\nSG: I absolutely love what you said, Natalie, about people coming to you with a solution. If I go back in my mind to my darkest period of work as an L&D professional, it was people coming up and just saying we want a one-day piece of training on fire safety or we want one hour for learning on quality standards and they came in with that much of a prescriptive definition of what it was they wanted to the length of time, as well, and, quite often, once you do that consultancy piece and you ask the questions, you might find that learning isn't even the solution that they need, it's actually a comm's piece or something else.\nNC: And, Payal, is it easy sometimes for internal departments to actually ask those questions because, I mean, you're often up against people you work with every day and that might be awkward?\nPGB: It is, indeed, very awkward and depending at which layer of the organisation you are working at and the culture of the organisation, it can be very tricky, as well. So, colleagues in L&D all across the hierarchy of the organisation will get questions and queries like this. We will get suggestions of what solutions to provide, however, not everybody has the professional courage to ask those questions and the higher up you get, the tricker it becomes because you're not just thinking about challenging, as Natalie said, you have to use that word carefully, it's not about challenging somebody's idea or recommendation, it's about really getting them to critically think through what is it that they really want and sometimes that's scary for the person on the other end listening because they may have not thought it through. So, it's like going to the doctor and saying I want a headache medicine but then when the doctor says okay, so what are your symptoms, you know, what is it that you are feeling, what is it that you would like to improve. Sometimes they have an answer, sometimes it's just oh, I have got a general feeling in the subregion of my head that's aching and I feel like headache medicine would solve it but that might not really be the case.\nNC: Is it easier for you, Payal, because you're a freelancer?\nPGB: I've got both the hats on. So, I have worked in corporate for a very long time and only recently, in the last five years, become a freelancer. I think no freelancer or consultant would be able to do a good job if they didn't ask these questions and it does become easier because, at the end of the day, freelancers are much more measured against what they deliver compared to somehow the in-house team and so you're held much more accountable, often your financials or your reward at the end doesn't come through until it's delivered on what it's supposed to. So, most professionals who are working as freelancers tend to ask these questions and are a lot more rigorous in their approach to questioning at the start to demonstrate that impact, whereas L&D teams are in a little bit of a safer cushion sometimes and, therefore, might find it more challenging to ask those questions.\nNC: Okay. So, Steve George, should we, kind of, start getting into the meat of what those questions are and how you ask them and who you ask them to. Set us up for moving into this, well, I suppose it's what's some people call performance consulting, isn't it, rather than just running the course or whatever it is.\nSG: Yeah, sure. So, I am going to quote my good friend and CIPD colleague, Andy Lancaster, who has a great definition for performance consulting that it focuses on diagnosing organisational needs and opportunities, it defines the contributing causal factors, it describes the required future state and delivers the appropriate solution. So, if you start with those around diagnosing the organisational needs and opportunities, then you need to think around what the problem is that you are looking to solve for the organisation. So, that would be where I would start. So, is it something relatively simple or is it a symptom of something more complex.\nNC: Okay. Now, I was chatting to both of you briefly beforehand and I noticed Natalie Richer has seven steps and I think Payal has five but I'm sure the broad thrust is going to be similar. So, Natalie, just, kind of, take this up from here. What sort of conversations do you have, what are you trying to find out when you're setting up learning?\nNR: Yeah, I totally agree with Steve's point. What we need to start with is what the presenting problem is or, certainly, what the person I am talking to perceives it to be and where they're hoping to get to. Normally, with a performance consulting conversation, I am looking at two goals; I am looking at the goal for the conversation itself and the overall goal which is usually solving a problem or meeting a need and I do, I have a seven-step process. It requires me to ask lots of questions and before I jump into any of those, I start of by doing some contracting and that contracting is around my role, their role, asking for permission to ask all the questions; how long we've got together, who needs to be in the room and in that process, I am working hard to build trust because, as we've already acknowledged, quite often people are coming to us and they want a quick fix and we're, really what we're doing is slowing down and that can be really frustrating. So, I'm trying to get them on side and I am trying to be as connecting as possible. So, I will spend quite a bit of time in that contracting phase, talking about the problem, the expected outcome and so on before I start moving on to the remaining seven steps.\nNC: Okay. Payal, how do you tackle all this?\nPGB: Natalie put it way more eloquently than I would have said it. I'll just cut to the chase but, absolutely, you have to build that trust and rapport at the very beginning. It's creating that psychological safety where people feel it's okay to share with the consultant or with the coach or with the L&D partner some of their concerns around their team.\nNC: How do you actually have those conversation, Payal? Do you sit down with people face-to-face, do you just send them lots of e-mails, have lots of exchanges; how does it work?\nPGB: It's never on e-mails, Nigel. These sorts of things, the more you can get into a dialogue, the better. Face-to-face would be ideal but, if not, a tele-conferencing facility is equally good but the idea is to understand the nuance that it's not just what they are saying, it is also what they are not saying and, you know, the points at which their eyes kind of go up and they're looking at and thinking and pondering, those are when the meaty answers come in. So, it's kind of like what you do in coaching, as well, you setup the stage and you allow them the freedom to express themselves without coming across as threatening or condescending or an expert. You're just there as an investigator trying to find out, very open enquiry, what it is that you would really like to see out of this and, you know, sometimes the question that I begin with is really, what is the pinpoint, you know, what is the one thing you would like solved out of this. If you get them to nail that one question down and you might have to ask it in six different ways using six different sentences and six different questions but it's about that pinpoint and once they feel comfortable sharing that pinpoint, then the rest of the conversation flows a lot more easily.\nNC: And Steve George, you kind of see the great variety across the country of the way different learning and development teams do this kind of work. Have you any kind of thoughts about how practice is changing, whether people are learning these lessons?\nSG: I think they are, yeah. I think there is a real move towards what Payal referred to as demonstrating impact and the way you demonstrate impact is by meeting that organisational need. So, if you ask those questions from the outset and you have that organisational trust and you understand where it is that they're looking to get to and you can demonstrate having achieved that then it puts you in a really good place. So, yeah. I think there is a move towards that. One of the ways that I've seen it myself in recent years is around data protection. So, I always pick on GDPR because when GDPR came in, it was really hard to find training done well. So, quite often it would go into incredibly unnecessary detail about legislation, about Acts of Parliament and Acts of European Parliament, about the fines that you might get but in reality, what people need to know can be broken down into a far more simple, almost checklist of, so, they need to know what it looks like if there's a breach and what they need to do. They don't need to know incredible amounts of extraneous information and I think that kind of performance consulting approach has improved a lot of learning such as data protection learning over the past few years.\nNC: It also strikes me, Natalie, that while sitting in your home office, quietly devising a course might seem rather attractive on a wet Thursday, getting stuck in is more time consuming, it involves more conversations and requires different skills. I just wonder whether L&D is geared up to understand and deliver on the kind of skills necessary to have those successful conversations and then devise learning that matters and will do the job.\nNR: I am noticing a real need for L&D experts to get better at having performance consulting conversations and I think that comes from the need for organisations to prove the impact of learning to prove the return on investment and I think there is a real realisation that it doesn't start at the end, it's not an afterthought where we deliver learning and go gosh, we ought to now measure it, let's send out some happy sheets or let's observe some people. I think there's a real connection with let's ask some really, really sound questions upfront and let's set ourselves up for success. Let's start talking about not just where we are not but where we want to get to and building a step-by-step path to get there and making sure we have some really sound measures along the way in order to check people's understanding so it's not a come to some training and fingers crossed, you remember it and apply it. So, I'm noticing in my role, as I work with HR teams and L&D experts, that the questioning is getting more sophisticated. I think people are buying much more into performance consulting and more so than what was called training needs analysis which, kind of, made the assumption that training was going to happen. So, to Steve's point, I think I am noticing people getting better at asking questions knowing that the solution might not be training after all.\nSG: What you've touched on there, Natalie, as well as how the value to L&D professionals extends beyond just the impact, as well. It's really important as L&D professionals, we're demonstrating organisational understanding, strategic awareness, a bit of business acumen and by asking these questions, we're building our organisational networks, our organisational allies and we're demonstrating that knowledge as well as building that knowledge which enhances our credibility as well as our impact.\nNC: And it's important you get, Natalie, to the most important questions. Have you any, kind of, techniques, anything you do to make sure that you do have those conversations?\nNR: Yeah. I think one of the critical steps in asking performance consulting questions is to establish the system in which the organisation or teams perform. One of the important questions I ask is who is involved and I will draw, normally, sat side-by-side with someone, a rich picture of the system which involves the performers, stakeholders, sponsors and all the various teams and people that are connected and this is quite early on in the process and it's quite early on with the questions I ask but sometimes it's the bit that uncovers the problem. Sometimes in drawing out, mapping out on a big piece of paper who's connected to who and where they sit and who's performing well and who's, perhaps, underperforming and what the budget is and so on, we actually figure out at that stage where the problem is and sometimes, we don't go any further.\nNC: And that, to me, paints a brilliant picture of why the wrong kind of training or learning doesn't work because it hasn't got to grips with that. It's just tinkering at the edges.\nNR: Absolutely.\nNC: Payal, I just wondered if any particular examples of work that you've done spring to mind as to how this works in practice and what the benefits are?\nPGB: Yes. Before I go into that, just very quickly, just to add to what Steven and Natalie have said about business acumen, absolutely, a very evidence-based approach, absolutely and then critical thinking. Where performance consulting is a little bit different from training needs analysis is training needs analysis is more collecting the data, analysing what's there and then coming up with a solution. Critical thinking is taking it a step back and thinking, hang on a second, let's not look at the data just yet. Let's look at the problem. Let's start with observation. It starts with what is practically missing, it starts with where are the gaps and then goes into thinking well, what data can we pull up to help us really understand this in a lot more depth. So, do I have a practical example, absolutely. I left the listeners with a little bit of cliff-hanger. So, with my client that asked for time management training, they came up with exactly that thinking we do some time management training, it's a team of 12 people, they work across three geographical regions within the Middle East and they just don't seem to be hitting their SLAs.\nSo, the very first question I asked was 'Okay, what would you really like to see happen?' and the answer was 'well, I really want to see the process move smoothly and, you know, the SLAs being achieved, our customers and clients receiving their sales orders on time.'. I said 'Brilliant, what do you think is stopping them from achieving that right now?' and this is where the question was directed not at the person that came to me but with his team who are actually the people day-in-day-out running this process and their response was well, that team doesn't understand what my commitments are, when they delay their work, my work gets delayed, when this happens it has a consequential impact on this, I need three days for this, I need two days for this and there's just no understanding of this and so the entire conversation was around how do you get the team communicating better. It was nothing to do with time management, that was a by-product. They didn't need an L&D intervention at all. All they needed was the teams to get together and a facilitator to help them understand their process. Once they understood the process and the interdependencies, they suddenly realised oh, I didn't realise my work impacted you this way or that way and they started communicating with more transparency and expressing their requests with a little bit more saying here's the leeway, here's where you can shift around a little bit and, eventually, they were able to meet their SLAs. So, sometimes, the solution out of performance consulting conversations is not an L&D scenario, it's just open and transparent communication. So, do I need a headache pill for a stomach-ache? Probably not.\nNC: Natalie Richer, all this might sound daunting for some, this approach to learning and development. I just wonder what barriers might make this approach challenging to use the word, again?\nNR: I think we mentioned one of them already which is time pressure. When I'm working within organisations, my internal customers have often got to a solution because the problem has existed for quite some time and really what they want me to do is fix it quick and so it can seem really laborious going through a performance consulting approach when somebody just wants a quick answer and a quick fix and also, I come across people who are quite challenging themselves and can be quite manipulative, actually, because they want something set up quickly. So, it can feel a little bit daunting, we've said it already, but I think the key is building trust and building rapport and establishing relationships but also bringing people on side to understand that, actually, you're partnering with them to help them fix a problem. So, it's incredibly important to do that partnering, to really listen to make sure people are really heard, to empathise which is why when people come to me with a solution, I always accept that solution as being a thing we're going to talk about because if I challenge too quickly, people get defensive quickly. So, it's really important that we partner and I do that, you know, normally, sitting side-by-side with someone as Payal said, never really on e-mail, always in a room with someone if I can and sometimes with groups of people in a room working together on solutions.\nNC: And, Steve George, that Learning at Work Report 2023 noted that the workload of learning teams is already has already significantly increased. I just wonder whether this kind of approach is going to help or hinder that overload because it is a worry for people?\nSG: I think it helps.\nNC: It helps?\nSG: Yeah, it absolutely helps take away some of that workload because while you're putting in the investment of time at the beginning because your impact is greater, ultimately, you're serving your organisation and its people better. You're also reducing your future work because you're actually solving the problem as opposed to a short term fix which just delays solving the problem to a later date. Exactly to Natalie's point that having all the people in the room when you have those conversations so you have your stakeholders and you have, perhaps, well, you have learners in there, as well, then you're building your advocates for the learning. So, you don't get into such a situation where you're launching learning to people who either don't want it or don't understand the benefits of it or don't even do it and this is made mandatory. So, you're building those advocates and you're reducing your workload through doing that, as well.\nNC: Presumably, some of that is easier, Steve, if you really have a clear agreement on what people want to see as a result of learning?\nSG: Absolutely. So, it's about what Payal said around making sure you understand what the desired outcome is. So, where is it that they're trying to get to and then Natalie speaks about contracting. They're absolutely critical in defining that.\nNC: And, Payal, you were saying to me beforehand something about it's useful to have a critical friend, who is that and how do they help?\nPGB: The critical friend is our performance consultant and the way they are being a critical friend is very much by being on their side. So, they're very friendly, they're very approachable, they're on their side and listening to what they are saying but, at the same time, are not afraid to say here's what I am hearing, could there potentially be a different way of solving this and so the critical aspect of it is in asking more open-ended questions which is not about the solution, which is more about how they're going to improve their organisation. So, connecting it back to organisational KPIs or organisational outcomes rather than what they want to see within their teams sometimes gives them that bigger-picture thinking and that's the job of a critical friend or a performance consultant to just get that tunnel vision slightly upwards and to get people to think a little bit more widely and broadly.\nNR: I love the idea of the critical friend. I've been in performance consulting conversations before where somebody said to me thank you for holding the mirror up and I am not sure I was a critical friend but I was playing back a lot of what I was hearing, particularly in talking about the, kind of, the cost of the gap, the cost of doing nothing. So, when people talk about we are here and we want to get there, I challenge them a little bit about what if we did nothing, what would be the worst that could happen and people are often quite surprised by what they say about where their teams are going, where the business might go and sometimes people get quite emotional and I think, sometimes, people are a little bit surprised by what comes out and that's where I got that comment 'thank you for holding the mirror up'. So, it, sort of, spoke to me this part about being a critical friend.\nNC: Steve George, can we say any more about how you monitor progress as you go rather than being disappointed at the end when it's too late?\nSG: Yeah. So, if you've got your clear outcome definition, so you know what the performance training is going to be and what the outcome of that performance training is going to be towards the end and you've asked the right questions and you've done your consultancy piece then you can keep referring back and make sure that those questions are being answered by the steps that you're taking. Part of that consultative approach, I think, is understanding that it may attritive. So, where you start with a solution isn't necessarily the solution that you finish with. So, by maintaining those conversations, keep asking those questions, is this doing what we set out to do so you don't get into that sunk-cost fallacy of doing something just because it's what you started on. Keep going back and keeping yourself honest, keep holding the mirror up as you go.\nNC: And, Steve, if you have one bit of advice for organisations wanting to raise their game a bit?\nSG: So, I would ask people to consider what assumptions they're making. Ask that critical friend if they need, what assumptions were you making in the request that we're presenting and then trying to move those assumptions.\nNC: Okay. Natalie Richer, for you, what are the benefits of this, kind of, modern performance consulting approach to planning and delivering learning?\nNR: I think just finding out in partnering with organisations that there are really creative ways of solving problems and helping organisations to see that often what they need already exists within the organisation. We've said it before but quite often we've set out thinking we need training and we end up finding out we actually needed a really good poster in the staff room or we needed a subject matter expert to coach others and sometimes we save organisations money and sometimes we help people to realise they have expertise already in the business and they don't necessarily need the help of an external training provider. So, I think that's really exciting.\nNC: Wow, you've probably saved somebody a lot of money already. Payal, we're focusing very much on questions to ask before you start. So, a few final tips from you on actions to make sure you end up with the best learning solution.\nPGB: One of my favourite questions to ask is what would make you feel like you've achieved what you wanted, what is success going to look like for you, how will you know the training has made a difference and just asking them to reflect on those three questions asked in different ways, it can make such a huge difference to the design process, it can make such a huge difference to the way you deliver it, it can also definitely make a huge impact on the impact you see at the end of it and just to add to what Natalie was saying, one of the added benefits, the hidden, the unexpected benefits of doing this performance consulting right is it gives L&D professionals a chance to be creative. Naturally, L&D professionals tend to be creative and they are natural problem solvers, however, sometimes, it can be limiting whereas when you keep the doors completely open to asking what success looks like and thinking about multiple options, multiple scenarios and situations in dealing with this, then that's where the creativity really comes in.\nNC: Brilliant.

      "full_text": "Duration: 36:00\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy (NC): No one wants stressed, unhealthy and unhappy staff that don't engage or perform well. So, now's the time to ensure no one misses out on the mental and physical health and wellbeing support that they need. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nWith all the advances in our understanding of the need for workplace wellbeing, what are we to make of CIPD findings that sickness absence is at a 10-year high and that wellbeing support for individuals through their work life can be patchy? There's clearly more to do to create trustful, supportive environments where people can continue to perform and enjoy their work, and without organisations wasting money on unproven wellbeing activities or patent solutions. Here with ideas on Change for the Better, Nick Pahl, who heads the largest organisation for health and work professionals, his Society of Occupational Medicine not only aids employees with long-term health problems, but works with HR and others to prevent and remove ill health and promote wellness. Hi, Nick.\nNick Pahl (NP): Nice to meet you. That's a great introduction. Nice to be here.\nNC: Our next guest worked in human resources when she saw how careers suffer when people go through personal challenges that aren't understood or supported. She's now an Associate Professor in Human Resource Management at Manchester Metropolitan University. It's Dr. Krystal Wilkinson. Hello.\nKrystal Wilkinson (KW): Hi, Nigel. Pleased to be here.\nNC: And from the Home Team, a welcome return for Rachel Suff, who leads on the CIPD's public policy work for employment relations and health and wellbeing. Hi, Rachel.\nRachel Suff (RS): Hi, Nigel. Really pleased to be part of this discussion.\nNC: And I can see from the latest CIPD Health and Wellbeing at Work report, Rachel, that in spite of all that's done in this arena, workers may well suffer health and wellbeing knockbacks at different stages of their work life.\nNC: So, I just wonder if you can give us a sense of the, well, the almost unseen areas where things going on in people's lives intrude on what once may have been a perfectly happy work life.\nRS: Yeah, well, it's a really important area in terms of organisations understanding how to best support people and their health and their wellbeing at work. If organisations really want to take a strategic, holistic approach, which we're really encouraging, which organisations are trying to do, to supporting people's health and wellbeing at work, then they really need to understand how they can best support the whole person. And at certain points as we journey through life and through work, all of us at some stage will experience certain life events. Now, some are associated with a particular stage of life, such as if you're trying to start or grow a family, if you're experiencing menopause, if you've got issues with your menstrual health, if you're caring for somebody, a child or an elder person, other issues like bereavement can sadly happen at any stage of life. But if organisations understand these external wellbeing pressures and issues that people are going through, doesn't mean they can control them. But what they can do is first of all, make sure that work doesn't make people's experience even worse. And also, they can put specific support in place to help people cope with what they're going through.\nNC: I absolutely get all that. But I want to ask Nick Pahl ultimately, why is it that organisations are homing in on wellbeing? I mean, is it honestly, because absenteeism is getting out of hand, long term sickness and all that? Or is it because the law or some duty of care is obliging them to act? Or is it actually because it's the right thing to do?\nNP: Well, it's definitely the right thing to do. I think there's a moral imperative. And I think the pandemic saw people, managers in particular, having more of a duty of care. So, there's been a shift there. And the role of the manager is really important. It is also the bottom line. I think there's a return on investment, certainly for occupational health and interventions in this area. And the UK economy is seeing much more people off sick, I think 600,000 people. We're at an outlier now, compared to the OECD. And I think also, there's more legal and government interest to require companies to do this. Certainly, the Health and Safety Executive will come in when there's a safety critical or some serious health issues. But there's currently treasury and government interest and maybe requiring more of those consultations out for occupational health to be provided to SMEs. So, I think those three things, legal, moral, financial, and perhaps a kind of culture shift, a duty of care, where some of the things that Rachel was saying, those life events, the data saying that young men are finding it hard to join for some anxiety and stress, and there's a midlife musculoskeletal mental health, and there's menopause and women's health issues. And then the older worker, you know, they've got those responsibilities for their perhaps aging parents or their own health issues. And so right the way through people's working life, there are issues and employees need to meet that. I mean, work is good for you. We think, certainly, governments and most people will understand that purposeful work is great for you and should be part of a good, happy life. So, all those aspects are really important.\nNC: So, Dr. Krystal Wilkinson, I mean, wellbeing has become a kind of an industry to deal with all this, yet we're seeing this increase, as we heard from Nick. So, I mean, just, I don't know, looking back to when you were directly working in HR, do you think you were just missing the impact events or health issues were having on people, which ironically enough, now you're away from that in academia, you're really highlighting these?\nKW: Yeah, and I think it's an evolving landscape. You know, there's historically, there's certain things because of legislative provisions that have been on people's radars. They've been in CIPD training programmes and stuff. There are emerging issues, not because they've never been there before, but I think at a societal level, there's been, there's been taboos. I mean, historically, cancer was something that would never be talked out about at work. Mental illness is something that would never be talked about at work. And we've only really seen in recent years, a growing interest in women's health issues. I think the menopause revolution has been helpful on that front. So, the wonderful work of Davina McCall and so on, kind of a cultural level that are starting to make people talk about it and then talk about it in the workplace. You know, there are some shifts in demographics that will be kind of having an impact as well, and things like a rise in accessibility for things like fertility treatment. I mean, it's going to be, you know, potentially more people are affected, and more people have the opportunity to navigate it, but then that becomes something that transfers into the workplace.\nNC: So, why then isn't this being picked up?\nKW: Well, I think it is, slowly. You know, there is a small, but increasing proportion. If you look at the CIPD's health and wellbeing survey, you know, the last two years, we've had this question around these health issues that affect certain groups of your staff, certain kind of proportions of the workforce. And there is some great movement in the right direction. There's wonderful campaigning from quite high profile groups. We've got fertility matters at work. There's been legislative campaigning as well around some of these issues. So, there might be movement around time off for pregnancy, loss, early kind of miscarriages. There's the government's women's health strategy. That's obviously, we've got a menopause champion now from a government parliament level. So, I think it is moving in the right direction.\nNP: I mean, I think there's good reasons why people don't. I mean, a lot of companies, they feel they're too busy. Perhaps they don't understand, you know, what they can do. They don't understand what occupational health is. A colleague of mine went to Jaguar Land Rover recently and talked to three small businesses. And she said, one business just didn't care, you know, about Jaguar Land Rover trying to get a supply chain interest in health and wellbeing, because that gives them more certainty for their supply chain to build their cars. So, one didn't care. One said, oh, you know, we've got occupational health and wellbeing, just don't understand what it does. We've got it, but you know, don't understand it. And the third one was Mr. so like three little pigs, like the good one, and said, yeah, we can design to do job design and we'll have all these things that we also test out occupational health and wellbeing, make sure that their experience is one and engage with the workforce on it. I mean, just like life in general, some people, you know, really go for it, others go middling and others not at all. So, I mean, I think that the CIPD survey said managers are more interested in it, but companies have slightly reverted to form or company directors, leaders, slightly kind of reverted to before COVID kind of, you know, some middling interest. I don't know if that's right, Rachel, but it's, it is a concern. I mean, particularly when you've got 2.6 million people off work due to ill health, you know, we've got a real problem here in the UK now and that's affecting, you know, productivity and growth.\nRS: That's right. And I think I'd agree with both Nick and Krystal. I think some employees are acting, others aren't. And I think we are seeing slow progress, quicker in some areas than others. And in our health and wellbeing survey report, that really showed the significant increase in awareness and support and guidance and policies around menopause transition. And I think that's a really good example of how we can see change and progress happen quite quickly, because now we find that nearly half of organisations have got some support. Four years ago, only 10% had any kind of awareness, support, guidance. So, things are definitely moving in the right direction in terms of support for menopause. So, then when we look at menstrual health, that's gosh, around 15%. It's really, really low. So, it's very uneven. There's a really, really strong rationale for organisations taking action and providing support for employees, thinking about the main health risks and wellbeing issues that they could be encountering, because there is so much to gain. You're going to be much less likely to leave an organisation, for example, if you're supported. And we know through all the research that we've done, that people consider or even leave an organisation if they don't get support and understanding.\nNC: And Krystal, your own experience, I think, mirrors that, doesn't it? Sort of change that you made in your own life from working in HR to trying to understand and help people whose careers maybe had gone off track because of situations in their own lives which weren't being understood by their employers.\nKW: Yeah, I mean, I think I can see both sides of it. So, it's quite easy for academics to kind of do these studies on kind of niche topics and point out, all of the unique challenges that people have and aren't businesses not very good for not accommodating all these things that are going on. And then you've got the business reality of the fact that there are competing pressures. You've got other stakeholders within the organisation that will need convincing of the return on investment. You'll have line managers that you're quite often expecting to enact all of these policies. And suddenly, they are the squeezed middle where they're suddenly expected to be experts on all these hundreds of myriad different kind of non-work personal challenges. And I think a lot of the stuff that I've been trying to do in terms of the messaging with organisations is around there's some kind of general principles that you can put in place around creating a psychologically safe culture where people feel that they can come and raise non-work concerns and have them be considered and be considered legitimate in the workplace, that they're not stigmatised, they're not taboo, that you can raise awareness of a number of different non-work challenges that people might have. You can consult your people.\nIf you're in a bigger organisation, there might be staff networks, where you can go and kind of get the feeling of what issues and priorities would they like to see, have a calendar of different awareness weeks that you can mark just to raise these issues, get them on the agenda, get them on the website somewhere so that if somebody types in IVF into their intranet, they get a hit and they think this is something we can talk about. And a lot of the principles around good management are the same across all of these different kind of non-work challenges and issues certainly that I've been involved with researching, which is around it's an individual need, an individual experience that will need probably some form of adjustment to your day-to-day work, whether that's flexibility over hours or work location or workload or some thinking ahead in terms of anticipating challenges and what we might do to deal with it. And then managers being generally aware. And I'm not advocating for line manager training on every single non-work challenge that somebody might have.\nNC: I was going to say, do you actually need a policy for everything? Because you've already mentioned numerous sort of health or mental health concerns or issues. I mean, it would be very difficult for an organisation to know what to do in every situation.\nKW: I'm advocating for reasonable, you know, what's reasonable. So, a little less than me, no, that's not reasonable. A massive multinational organisation, or maybe it is reasonable to have a policy because of the resources that you've got. But, you know, if you have some line manager training that is on wellbeing or on equality, diversity and inclusion, you can make reference to some of these things just to get it on the radar and then yet have principles or guidance around certain topics and signposting so that people know where to go. And that might be occupational health.\nNP: I just think this is an important issue. You know, people listening, they're going to think wellbeing, Okay, what can I do about it? And, you know, it'd be nice to have a quick win and say, okay, you know, everyone, I've got to go off and do yoga and have a policy on this and that. And I suppose I'd urge listeners to just think strategically about what they want to achieve. They want to improve wellbeing. They want to improve health. And a good place to start is, you know, surveying their staff, working with them on, you know, what are the issues, you know, what are the key issues, be it menopause or mental health, musculoskeletal, and then doing a sort of intervention, you know, physiotherapist for, you know, musculoskeletal, mental health, putting in place some sort of support and then looking at that change and see, you know, if the change has happened and listening to workers and engaging with them and in particular focusing on managers. I mean, another sort of controversial areas is people think, oh, I can just put in a mental health first aid training for managers or whoever and, you know, job done. And, you know, the evidence for that is poor, you know, as much as there's many people who have gone down that route.\nAnd I'm a judge actually on these CRPD awards for kind of best private sector wellbeing initiative. And, you know, the ones that win are the ones that think strategically. They've put in intervention, which includes occupational health, hopefully, follows the data and there's an ongoing process. I mean, now there's tools, isn't there, where you can hear from your staff, you know, regularly. And I know, I think IBM do something where they kind of, through AI, they see what staff are talking about. And suddenly people are saying, that's ridiculous. I can't take time off to kind of go to my GP appointment. It's really affecting my job. And they sort of change the policy pretty rapidly. So, staff at least feel listened to and supported in a kind of real-time way. But fundamentally, it is about taking, you know, this problem isn't something you just do and then move on to something else. You know, your peoples a great resource and you have to strategically focus it and do interventions that have an evidence-based buy-in with people who are professionals, such as occupational health.\nNC: I want to get Rachel to pick this up. But just before we leave you for the moment, Nick, I wanted to ask, I mean, occupational health is best known for dealing with people who have often quite serious health complications at work. I wonder what it takes on the ground to be more proactive? I mean, working alongside HR and other organisations, what would be good for the future?\nNP: Yeah, good question. I mean, there needs to be more proactive. I think occupational health often is put into reactive, you know, for complex cases, you know, people with different sort of complicated health issues. And I think it's the nature of that contract that the company has, which allows occupational health to work with HR, work with people and leaders in the organisation, say, okay, what are we going to do to shift this and move to a more preventative, proactive approach? You know, with CIPD, we're just about to launch a new document, actually, which runs through how you, occupational health, human resources work together to improve mental health and wellbeing in the workplace, prepared by Dr. Kevin Teoh from Birkbeck. And look out for that later this month, I think it's going live. And I think it runs people through, I mean, something that we use is just kind of primary, secondary, tertiary interventions, which sounds a bit like everyone's switched off and goes to sleep. But primary is have that strategic approach. Secondary is perhaps doing a sort of individual, kind of more reactive. And tertiary is sort of a bit too late. So, I think the important thing is, as we all know, prevention is better than cure and have a strategic approach. So, you don't turn into this, which often happens, unfortunately, and we don't like. It's a kind of slightly punitive, kind of complex cases, reactive rather than preventative and proactive, as you say.\nNC: So, Rachel, we've had some good suggestions already, both from Krystal and from Nick Pahl, about things you can do to begin to assess where you are and to improve how you work with people. But what sort of obstacles do HR people encounter when they try to improve wellbeing? I mean, one that's immediately coming to my mind is that these are very private matters, and a lot of people don't want to talk to HR or occupational health. They sort of see it as a sort of sign of weakness. So, what sort of feedback do you get on ways of improving approaches to wellbeing?\nRS: Well, I think this goes back to what Krystal was saying, actually, about whether you need a policy for every single topic, because there are an awful lot of life events and wellbeing issues that are going to affect people. And I think it is much better to take a principles-based approach. And one of those areas is around creating the right kind of culture and tackling those kind of silences and stigma that exist in connection with a lot of these issues, like menstrual health, gambling harm, alcohol, drug abuse, menopause. You know, I can go on and on. And yes, these can seem like very private, intimate matters, and they are to a lot of people. And I think that's what creates the fear on a lot of people, not feeling confident to talk about these issues at work. And some people will still maybe not want to talk about what is going on if they, for example, experiencing challenges trying to conceive or if they have lost a baby or pregnancy. But I think the key, the onus, is on the organisation to create the kind of environment where people can talk about these issues if they want to. Make sure that line managers are not going to be embarrassed and not going to shy away from talking about issues that are sensitive and personal. It doesn't mean that everybody will necessarily want to share, but if you create that environment, you're still making it easier for that person in that organisation because you're sending positive messages and saying, we support you, we recognise this is a wellbeing issue.\nNC: I can certainly see you nodding there, Krystal Wilkinson. But there is another question here. I mean, Rachel's been talking a lot about things that go on in people's own lives that impinge on their work, but work makes people ill sometimes. And I can see that organisations, they can't just focus on helping you with your problems. It may be the work that's the problem and having a catch up with somebody every week and patting them on the head and then not changing their workload, nothing's going to be solved, is it?\nKW: Yeah, I mean, looking at the literature, the academic literature around kind of like wellbeing and work and stuff, and we can see that there is a kind of a disconnect sometimes between the provisions that are put in place, which are very reactive. And it's about, you know, fix the individual who's not resilient. Let's give you some yoga or let's give you some meditation app to work with, which is very different than a lot of the causes. Back to what Nick was saying, you need a multi-pronged attack. You need something that's looking at the overall environment and the drivers and causes of ill health that might be personal or they might be job related, you know, and having a kind of a look, trying to get kind of strategy around addressing those factors. And then separately at an individual level, having an appropriate pathway for supporting each individual who is struggling, you know, whether that might be looking at their workload and that's where like reasonable adjustments, temporary reasonable adjustments might be, you know, for some of these things, might be short term around their workload, around their hours of work, around their working environment. It might be, you know, they need referrals to counselling or some other thing, but, you know, you need to be looking both at the kind of the proactive side and the reactive side when someone is unwell.\nNP: I mean, just to come in there, I think data is important and, you know, some overall workplaces are bad for people's health, but generally not. And it's a case of some bits of an organisation might be, I remember talking to the chief medical officer at BP and they've got a way in which they can understand where teams are struggling and there's sort of absence and sort of health issues and through kind of data analytics and they can go into that team and, you know, often it's something like a manager bullying or being kind of terrible manager, leading to that team underperforming and therefore you have to kind of obviously work to improve that situation. So, you know, I just think using data strategic approach is a good way forward, particularly for larger organisations.\nNC: Can you be even a little more specific, data collected from where exactly? Because I mean, this is all evidence-based stuff, which is good.\nNP: Yeah, I mean, I suppose employee surveys and sort of data on performance of different teams, if you can see a dip in performance in terms of their productivity or, you know, what their income they're bringing into the organisation. There's different metrics that people use, but increasingly companies are using, you know, with obviously permission and you mustn't sort of use it without permission from employers. Using data to understand where teams are performing, not performing and also you can see from absence management and sort of your data dashboard approach where there's problems and then you can intervene.\nNC: And I noticed a mention on one of your documents, Nick, about psychological risk. Can you just tell me about that?\nNP: Psychological risk, well, you know, healthcare workers or people working in the military or firefighters, there's some sectors, pretty obviously, where you have that there is risk. But a team is so important, isn't it? I remember we had a street party and just after Grenville and the fire brigade came to kind of everyone play with that fire engine. And I said, is everyone okay following Grenville? And said, yeah, everyone was fine, except for one person who went straight on holiday and didn't have that time, you know, with the team members to sort of talk about obviously a horrible situation. So, the Health and Safety Executive have a brilliant sort of stress risk assessment matrix you can use for, you know, looking at where the risks are in terms of impact on stress and anxiety and then intervene. But I think, you know, we need to be pragmatic.\nAnd I think some people say, oh, you know, anxiety and stress is part of life, unfortunately, and, you know, we have to deal with it. And as one thing to reduce stress, another thing to medicalise, we must be really careful not to, and that's where the sort of perhaps dangers of mental health first stage comes in, where people say, well, it sounds like you're in depression. And if you medicalise, then people kind of box themselves in and it can be a worse situation. So, you have to be pragmatic and engage with people, make sure that, you know, say if they're off sick with stress, to keep in touch daily, every day someone's off sick, more likely, they're not going to come back. So, it's just a commonsense kind of compassion, authentic engagement, which I think actually has changed in COVID. I think managers now do realise this, as Rachel said, to kind of people bring their whole need to feel that they can bring themselves to work with all the things that are going on in their life, you know, back home with bereavement or whatever.\nRS: And I think if you talk about psychological risk, I think it's quite important and relevant to think about that in relation to these external personal life issues and health challenges that people are going to experience, because there aren't many of them where you aren't going to experience very likely some kind of emotional or mental wellbeing impact. So, if you think about bereavement, if you're experiencing issues with fertility, if you've lost a baby or pregnancy, alcohol or drug misuse, terminal illness, gambling harm, you know, there was very likely going to be for most people, some kind of mental or emotional wellbeing impact as well. So, I think it is really important to think about what framework you've got in your organisation to support people and promote good mental wellbeing as well in the organisation, because that will help in terms of having that culture and having that approach based on being proactive and prevention as well.\nNC: And what do you do, Rachel, if senior managers don't get it?\nRS: Well, I think it's really important that senior leaders lead on the issue in a really visible way. We know that any initiative in an organisation, if the board, the senior leadership team aren't on board with it, then that will filter down and it won't be given priority through the other ranks of management and within the organisation. So, I think it does mean, I mean, HR, occupational health, you know, gathering that data and as big a range of data as you can come up with, really pointing out the benefits and the risks of not acting on this. You know, we know people leave work if they're not supported. So, it very much is about your whole talent management approach and your effectiveness as an organisation. It's about employee engagement. And I think senior leaders do understand about the links between employee engagement and having a productive, high performing workforce. And every organisation, every leader wants that. So, I think it does mean developing that business rationale. Because if they're not going to be influenced by the moral argument, I think now's a good time because I think during the pandemic, health and wellbeing and its importance became a critical business continuity issue and it shot up the agenda. It has trickled down a little bit in terms of priority, but I think a lot of senior people will be open to the argument and the difference, especially if they're presented with the evidence.\nNC: Yes, because you made me think again about that powerful story Nick told a little while ago about three suppliers to a large organisation with very different responses. I just wondered, Krystal Wilkinson, how you persuade that company that's very cynical about wellbeing initiatives, that these are actually worthwhile. Maybe they're lucky they haven't got a lot of sickness or something.\nKW: Rachel mentioned that the business case, you know, and the business case around a lot of these issues is not just about sickness absence, you know, because we know that presenteeism is a big problem, which is where people, because they don't feel psychologically safe, you know, or for whatever reason, they turn up to work when they're ill and they're not performing to the best of their abilities. It's a recruitment issue, it's an engagement issue, it's a performance issue, it's a retention issue, as well as these, you know, there's growing evidence that shows that if you, you know, you look after people, you let them bring them whole selves to work, that they will be more productive and they will stay and they will recommend you as an employer.\nNC: Absolutely. Okay, we've ranged over so many things there are to think about. Let's just try and tie this together with some wellbeing priorities and actions maybe people can do from each of you. Let's start with Nick for organisations that know they could do better. What should they start with?\nNP: I think agree with your leadership that you're going to take a coherent strategic approach, we're going to do this properly. We're not going to do a quick win. If we're going to take a strategic approach, we're going to get data on what the issues are. And we're going to do an intervention with the advice of HR, occupational health as what that intervention is going to be, we're going to then track whether there's been any sort of change and we're going to continually aim to improve that. And also listen to employees and focus in on the manager's role to ensure the manager supports their team and creates a culture focused on well-being that is really meaningful and the things that really matter for workforce, be the workforce being working at home, office environment, where there might be musculoskeletal mental health issues too, factory or other settings where again, there might be other issues to do with risks and hazards and use the best resources, look at the resources from the CIPD, the report that we're going to launch with them, look at the Health and Safety Executive. And this really matters because that's going to really improve your bottom line. If you see absence reduce, if you see more sort of happier staff able to come to work authentically, then no doubt your product will improve. So, it's definitely going to be worth it, but take it seriously and use professionals to help you with it.\nNC: Crystal, would you like to add anything to that?\nKW: Yeah, I mean, I just think really work on the culture and this idea of kind of psychological safety and this idea that we know that being well at work is in everybody's interest. And so, that every stakeholder in the organisation really should have a duty to try and enable that to be the case. So, while we can work a little bit on some of the work side drivers of illness, so if there's work intensification, there's short staffing, there's precarious conditions, and so on, you know, can we do anything about that sort of stuff? But also creating an environment where people can air the concerns, the worries, the non-work commitments, demands that they've got going on and see if there's a way to keep working through it, you know, in a way that will benefit both parties by having maybe just some adjustment or just some understanding. So, in our research around fertility journeys, people sometimes wanted to tell the work just to pre-empt the fact that my performance might go a bit wobbly, or I might, you know, didn't even need adjustment some of the time, they just wanted somebody to know, you know, so that they felt more of a buffer there for being able to carry on. So, yeah, awareness raising around a lot of these factors is a very easy, cheap, quick win. Signposting to a lot of the external supports and charities and resources that are out there. We're not expecting HR, certainly not line managers, to be experts in everything, but just that, you know, open door that we, you know, come and tell us what your issue is, and we'll try and help you.\nNC: And very pleasing, Rachel Suff, that a lot of what we just heard from Nick and Krystal are very much part of the CIPD's advice to people working on better wellbeing.\nRS: Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. Both what Nick and Krystal have said is absolutely spot on. I suppose I would just add to summarise the importance of trying to take an informed approach. So, everything that we've talked about in terms of gathering as much data as possible and information and engaging with employees to develop an approach for health and wellbeing that takes on board these life events and challenges that people might be experiencing, so that you are putting in place something that really does meet people's needs, rather than imposing something. So, that does mean engaging with any employee resource groups and networks, because people there might be really keen to contribute and have lived experience of some of these issues and that is so valuable, because these issues do require sensitivity and careful handling in terms of language, terminology and so on. So, you want to bring that level of sensitivity, compassion, empathy. So, I think definitely engage with people and make the most of some of those excellent external charities that Krystal mentioned, because they really are out there and they are developing resources and advice and so on, based on lived experience as well. So, that is really valuable and just make sure that line managers really understand what their role is and where it starts and where it finishes, because we don't want line managers who have got so much on their shoulders to stray into areas that could affect their health and wellbeing. So, yes, they should absolutely be able to have a conversation about anything from suicide risk to menstrual health to alcohol misuse. They do not have to be experts, they need to know when to refer on to expert sources like occupational health and other qualified professionals and sources of support, but they are absolutely a key linchpin in the whole health and wellbeing chain.\nKW: Can I just add one tiny point there as well around kind of senior manager role modelling is really, really helpful in some of the organisations that I've seen where you do have some kind of quite senior staff, either flexible working or sharing a blog or something about a challenge that they've gone through just to kind of open up those conversations.\nNC: Loads of ideas, thank you very much indeed. To Dr Krystal Wilkinson, we heard there from Manchester Metropolitan University, to Nick Pahl, Chief Executive of Society of Occupational Medicine, and the CIPD's own Rachel Suff for all coming on the podcast. Thanks too for all your responses and reposts after our 200th CIPD podcast last month, which, if you haven't caught it yet, was a really thoughtful anniversary discussion on the impact of remote working on our business cultures and how, as one respondent on LinkedIn put it, we can make FaceTime more meaningful. So, please subscribe wherever you get your podcasts and check out our recent back catalogue, but until next time, from me, Nigel Cassidy, and all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

For many organisations, remote working was a boon that enabled their businesses to carry on through the pandemic. All the while their people uncovered and experienced the benefits that working remotely had to offer. But as we unwind from the pandemic, some organisations that had seemingly settled on a balanced hybrid approach are making headlines for scaling back offering flexible remote working.\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Danielle Harmer, Chief People Officer at Aviva; Kevin Lyons, Senior HR Manager at Pearson; and Claire McCartney, Senior Policy Advisor at CIPD, as we explore how your organisation can take a more nuanced, deliberate approach to hybrid working.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 31:38\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Flexible working has changed millions of working lives for the better but at what cost? How can we replace or reinvent the face-to-face connections and shared valued that shaped our organisations in the first place. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nWelcome. Would you believe it's our 200th podcast. Well done team and thank you for keeping listening. To mark our 200th, the topic that we know from CIPD research is one of today's trickiest people issues; how do you balance our new working freedoms with post-Covid realities because our whole business culture is built on behaviour learnt from physically working alongside each other. The more we work alone, the more we risk losing shared purpose and belonging, the glue, the us in organisations, if you like. We ought to be concerned about this when we keep reading about yet another well-known business that seemed settled on hybrid working but is now using sticks rather than carrots to get staff back in but is there a more balanced approach which will allow workers to keep much of the autonomy and freedom from commuting that makes them happy?\nWell, three great guests with us from Aviva, from Pearson and CIPD but first, as it is our 200th edition, we asked a selection of workers and managers what they felt about the pros and cons of remote working in their organisations:\nVox Pop 1: There's a office culture. Young people coming in regularly, getting to know each other more and more and the remote working culture is mainly the older members of staff who've been working remotely for the last three years and that's problematic, I think.\nVox Pop 2: Out of about 90 employees, we've now downsized to an office that roughly takes about 40 people. We now need to book in otherwise won't get a spot. That creates a nice culture when you're in the office, as well, because part of the reason of going into the office is to see people and to be sociable.\nVox Pop 3: We live in Egypt. We have the different culture here. The biggest challenge was culture of the top management or line managers. They cancelled the working from home. That's an old fashion. We can develop the working from home policy to achieve what we need.\nVox Pop 4: Having meetings with people online has worked reasonably well. You know, you don't pick up the nuance of when someone is about to add their point and so you come to a stop. You might be reminding staff about your aims and objectives and there's something about when you do that online, it sounds rather forced.\nVox Pop 5: Online remote environments are quite formal. They have become quite, sort of, transactional. Where we are in this meeting to achieve this result. You could miss big things.\nVox Pop 6: We have a check-in once a week, usually on a Monday; how did the weekend go, what have you got on this week, when are you intending to come in, are people feeling overloaded, is something personally going on in their life.\nVox Pop 7: I don't think there's any problem with remote working. If people look after each other and respect each other, you can introduce almost any initiative and it ought to be fine if the values and culture of the organisation are strong enough.\nVox Pop 8: If you put yourself in the bosses shoes, a lot of them will panic about a lack of control. If they can see people, if they suddenly need to get them, they can walk over to their desk. Big companies are very keen to talk about trust and have it as a value and so on but I think it proves that in practice, trust is very hard to maintain when you can't see someone.\nNC: Well, lots to pick up on there. There's that trust issue, two tribes that exist in many companies and the difficulty of those back-to-back online meetings maybe for picking up on stressed or unhappy workers at home. We'll consider these kinds of questions and many more with the senior HR manager of the world's learning company, Pearson. His focus, he says, is especially on diversity, inclusion and the impact of technology. It's Kevin Lyons.\nKevin Lyons: Lovely to be here.\nNC: From the home team, CIPD senior policy advisor: resourcing and inclusion, with more than 20 years' experience considering the people aspects of organisations and performance, it's Claire McCartney.\nCaire McCartney: Hi, everyone.\nNC: And another influential HR practitioner with past senior roles including spells at Metro Bank and Lloyds Banking Group, she's chief people officer at the largest UK insurer, Aviva PLC. Welcome Dani Harmer, hello.\nDanielle Harmer: Lovely to be here.\nNC: So, Danielle, let's start with you. What interests me, I mean, some of those issues raised there. Why are comings rowing back from all home working including yours? Is it that senior managers maybe just don't quite trust people as we heard?\nDH: Well, let's face it, this is only an issue for companies that are, you know, office-based workers. So, those in hospitality and travel and, you know, retail, they're in a totally different space. So, I think we just need to be thoughtful about that. Every organisation that was home based has had to row back from it, well, has chosen to row back from it because you no longer have to force people to be at home. I think organisations that get it right, you know, obviously I'm going to think that we're doing a reasonably good job of it are the ones that say look, or try and understand and start to use the data, although it's still pretty early in terms of the data that we all have, to say what is it that being together brings as a benefit, when should you do it, what's the impact on performance for the organisation and productivity and, actually, engagement and wellbeing of people being together or being apart.\nNC: And do you actually know that from your own organisation; how things were before and after?\nDH: You know, time is rather helpful to start to get data and there are a few data points that I think are really interesting. One of the biggest predictors of whether or not a colleague will choose to spend time in the office is whether their leader does. So, intuitively, we'd all know, right, leaders are role models in this space. So, that's the first one. The second one that I think is really interesting is that when we start with engagement coming through and correlate that with office attendance, whilst lots of our people were very lucky, we have good levels of engagement but for the people who are not in the office very much, they are much more likely to be disengaged and, actually, they're much more likely to be so disengaged that they won't even engage with the survey. So, you sort of find completion rates are much lower and when they do complete it, their engagement levels are much lower. Then, finally, I think this is a really interesting trend that we are just starting to see. When we correlated mental health, mental wellbeing with office attendance, we saw that as we've made a, sort of, gradual climb back up to better levels of office attendance but still giving people much more flexibility probably than they had through the pandemic, mental wellbeing has improved. So, absences in relation to mental health challenges have reduced and, you know, it's this incredible correlation between the two and it's almost counter intuitive to what I would have expected because you kind of think well, people might just take a duvet day if they're not feeling great but actually people coming in now are feeling better for being in.\nNC: Right, and just before I go to the others, can I ask you quickly, do you mandate any particular days for your people to be in altogether or the managers decide which are the office days?\nDH: We've asked leaders to co-ordinate it with their teams because as we heard on of the, sort of, the vox pops before we started, the benefit of it is being in with the people you work with. So, we are asking leaders to work with their teams and co-ordinate it in a way that makes sense and think about the activities that they want people to be there together for.\nNC: You see, Claire McCartney, bosses mandating the office days, I suspect some people may not like that because it kind of removes that essential freedom, the flexibility that they enjoyed during the Covid times. Can you really take that away without making your workforce unhappy or even people leaving?\nCM: You know, I think that it is challenging and I think particularly mandating specific days can be a bit of a blunt tool because, actually, what it's doing is reducing employee choice and autonomy and we know that they are key drivers of wellbeing, engagement and motivation but, you know, there is definitely no one-size-fits-all and we are all working across different sectors, professions and, actually, what we need to do is work out what works best for our business, our roles but also for our employees as well. You know, despite hearing headlines in the media of everyone back in the office, that isn't necessarily the picture that we're seeing at the CIPD. So, around 80% of organisations have a hybrid policy in place, they're experimenting, they're learning. Some do want people in for a minimum amount of time, others don't.\nNC: Even Zoom, I saw. How ironic is that.\nCM: Yeah, I mean interesting. So, you know, Zoom are, kind of, learning from their own situation and seeing, actually, that there's a different way that works for them but there isn't a one-size-fits-all and I really encourage organisations to, kind of, review their own approaches and see what works best for them and their employees as well.\nNC: Absolutely. Well, we've heard from Dani that they've brought a lot of people back and that's working for them. By contrast, Kevin Lyons at Pearson, you were and remain pretty liberal, letting people choose where they work but I do see you've kind of gussied up your central London office to make it more attractive. So, just, sort of, talk about the mix that you have. I mean, what are the ground rules?\nKL: Well, the ground rules are that the employee decides, with the approval of their manager, what their working pattern is. That's put into the HR system, that gives a framework that everyone can work to and we don't mandate that people come into the office, we don't say you have to come in on a particular day of the week. we do like people to come in to the office because there are, as Dani was saying, there are advantages with face-to-face collaboration, meeting people etcetera. Equally, I think it's all about flexibly, Nigel. I think it's about allowing employees the flexibility. I think it's a phoney concept to say that work and life are separate. I think they are enmeshed and we have to find the best way to allow employees to dovetail work with their life. I'm thinking particularly about parents who need flexibility and this definitely impinges on equality for women because women are invariably the primary project managers and, at home, and the primary caregivers. They need flexibility in order to progress their careers. So, organisations can do that within a context of trying to encourage people back into the office but I think we have to be very careful about mandating days.\nNC: Before we go any further, can I just put that back to Dani because your organisation is alert, you create learning tools. I wonder, Dani, whether the kind of work you do where you're having maybe difficult conversations with customers and all that, do you think it's more difficult in an organisation like yours to give people the freedoms which we've just been hearing about?\nDH: I mean, i think Kevin is right. You can give people the freedom and I think there's a, sort of, philosophical decision that organisations need to make about where they stand on this. I mean, ultimately, you know, I personally love every single one of our 22,000 people but the start point of my relationship with them, Aviva's relationship with them, is an employment one and I think we just need to work out, kind of, where to draw the line on that. I totally echo Kevin's point about, you know, my least favourite phrase in the world is work-life balance. We all live a life and work is part of that for many of us. So, I think to, kind of, put them on two sides of a line is not right. I mean, on the gender point, it's a really interesting one and this is why flexible working or hybrid working can be quite a contentious, sort of, issue because we all have a view but the data is still, kind of, pretty early in coming through to demonstrate which approach is right. So, I worry on the gender point that, actually, if we give more flexibility particularly to women and they're, therefore, in the office less, that, actually, we might slowdown their careers and I don't know which is right. I don't know if Kevin's hypothesis is right or my hypothesis right. We are definitely tracking the data [laughter].\nNC: Well, let's ask Claire McCartney because she, kind of, sees this across the piece. What kind of light can you share, is there any research on this, can we form any conclusions about what we're doing with people?\nCM: Yeah. I think it's a really important discussion. So, thank you to both of you. We have been part of the hybrid working commission that recently launched a report. It showed that hybrid working had enabled more women to work fulltime and also had given much greater opportunity for people with disabilities and long-term health conditions. So, on one side, it's great in terms of getting people into work, sustaining it but I totally recognise what Dani is saying as well in terms of some of the inclusion challenges. We have got an issue there and we need to make sure that our managers are really great at managing people inclusively regardless of their work pattern and where they work because there are studies out there, a Deloitte study focusing on a global sample of women which shows that more women feel that they are left out of, you know, certain key conversations when they're working in a hybrid world. So, I think it's a balancing point, there are some real benefits in terms of access and participation but, actually, from a cultural perspective and from a line manager perspective, we need to get it right otherwise there will be some negative consequences.\nNC: Kevin, what do you have to say about that trust issue that one of our managers mentioned in the vox pops at the beginning that however much you want to trust people, if you can't see them, do we still have lots of unreconstructed bosses who just can't seem to distinguish between times when it's brilliant to get people together and times when, actually, they can get on with things on their own?\nKL: I think there are different leaders who have different views and they are maybe on a journey, as well.\nNC: Have you had to educate leaders on that journey ever?\nKL: Yeah. I had a conversation with a leader who said, you know, I want everybody back in the office and I said you're going to have to offer more flexibility. So, implemented the decision and came back to me two weeks later and said, I've had ten resignations in two weeks, you were right. So, we pivoted and I think you have to do that but sensibly. You set goals and outcomes. You set parameters, you set out what the employees have to achieve and then there has to be a level of performance management but you have to trust in flexibility. I think flexibility of working is what it's about. We also have to think about the march of technology, the march of technology. We wouldn't have been able to do all the working that we did during the pandemic without technology and every single day, the platforms are getting better and new tech is coming along. You can tell I am very keen on tech. So, generative AI is the next thing. So, people can work anywhere now, they don't have to come into an office. So, I don't see it as home and office, I see it as flexibility of working and also the organisations encouraging employees to come into the office for the reasons that we've talked about; face-to-face collaboration, the inclusion, the being with others but also there might be other reasons that you can entice people into offices and what I call destination offices. So, you quite rightly said, Nigel, you've refurbed your premises at Strand. Yes, we did. During Covid, we completely refurbished our head office and it's now a collaborative workspace with a swanky cafe, great views of London. It's in a brilliant location. People come in for that, as well, as well as the fact that they can work there. It's a shift in mindset. Different organisations have different challenges and we have people who work in test centres that have to be in a test centre, they have to be in a location. We have other employees where we can have much more flexibility to be able to where they work but, again, you can integrate flexibility; start times, their shift patterns, you can do everything that you can around flexibility and so I think, you know, that the genie is out of the bottle now on flexibility.\nNC: But what have we lost, Dani, if this just all continues? I mean, we want to talk a bit also here about the kind of cultures that created our organisations. Have you had any thoughts about this? Does it matter if we lament a loss of organisation or culture if we've created a new one or are there things that people learn by osmosis from each other that just can't be replaced by the style of working that Kevin's, clearly, pretty well getting used to?\nDH: There's something about, you know, when I said the engagement data for people who aren't in now. We all know that it might be people who are just not engaged and choosing not to come in or that not being in drives higher levels of disengagement and when people say to me I'm just as productive in the office as I am at home, my point isn't, you know, the employment relationship is not just about productivity. I want people who are set up to win, are learning from the people around them and growing and developing their careers in a way that work for them and for Aviva. You know, it's a, sort of, mutually beneficial relationship and that, sort of, stuff makes people sticky. Now, I think If you impose a lack of flexibility to the extent that Kevin describes, you know, one of his leader's did, that's not smart in an environment and in a market where, you know, the labour market is pretty tight and people have choice but I think being, as an organisation, being clear about why you want people to come in, what the benefits are. You know, in our investment management business, the way people learn, we have small, kind of, you know,  player-coach teams. The way people learn is just sitting around, they don't, please note  they do not sit around all day but [laughter] as they are working, they are hearing stuff and just picking up stuff by osmosis, as you say Nigel. Then, you know, in our customer facing teams, for example, because of the products that we support customers with, we are quite often talking to customers who are very ill, who have suffered a bereavement and while the teams are very supportive of each other, if you come off one of those calls at your kitchen table and you're on your own and you've just spoken to somebody who's, you know, just found out they've got terminal cancer or their husband has died and they need to make a claim, I think, you know, when I talk to the teams, having that team around them is really, really important. The, sort of, you know, the support network and I know you can do it virtually but I think it's so much more face-to-face.\nNC: Claire McCartney, we've heard a lot of points from Kevin and Dani. What particularly strikes you?\nCM: What strikes me is that there is, through our findings, there is a challenge from organisations' perspective around the weakening of organisational culture and also not being as connected to the organisation's purpose. There are lots of benefits but those two, I think, are areas that we need to start to address but rather than maybe having this constant conversation about focusing on number of days in the office, just as, I think, Dani and Kevin have been saying, we need to just say well, how do we make face-to-face time more meaningful, how often should we work together and for what purpose, how can we make the organisational come to life for our people both when they're working remotely but also when they're in the physical workspace. How can we get them inspired by our purpose and our mission through in-person events and also virtual opportunities. So, I feel like that is the focus that will help us in terms of addressing some of the challenges around culture and also connection to purpose.\nNC: I think it would be fair to say that people managers are more comfortable with those kind of conversations than line managers and bosses who might regard that as all rather unimportant and that's why they focus on how many days you're going to come in.\nCM: Yeah. Absolutely but I think it's that lack of connection in terms of purpose and culture which can actually really impact upon people's motivation and that can really impact upon performance in role as well. So, I think we really need to address those sorts of issues.\nNC: And while we're with you, Claire, I just want to ask you about how the, kind of, everyday aspects of a working life carry on under these new, kind of, hybrid circumstances, for example, how you get career progression when people aren't being seen every day and also, you know, how you get over to the performance management side? We heard one of the vox pops there, somebody said it is more difficult when you just want to talk to people about aims and objectives, the softer stuff, if you like, that doesn't relate to a specific task.\nCM: Yeah, and I think, you know, that's where people managers come in and where we need to be properly supporting them because, actually, it is more challenging, isn't it, you know, particularly if they haven't previously been used to working in this way. And don't forget loads of global companies work in this way and they're really successful and streamlined at it but how can we support our line managers to make sure that they're having those regular one-to-one conversations with people where, you know, they're talking about work and responsibilities but they're also talking about any challenges they might be having in their personal lives, wellbeing issues but also regular career conversations and I think if those regular conversations are in place,  it doesn't necessarily matter whether they're remote or in person if that, kind of, trust and regular conversation is taking place but it needs to be taking place in order to, kind of, move all of these points forward. And people managers really need to be aware of things like proximity bias. So, I'm not going to give all the opportunities to someone if they're in the physical workspace with me. I'm going to think really carefully and fairly about opportunities, as well. So, I think there's a lot we can do to support our people managers. They often have a lot on their shoulders, as well. So, I think we need to, you know, realise that and really support them where we can.\nNC: So, let's try and make this practical. Kevin and Dani, can I ask each of you then how you go about replacing some of the lost conversations, if you like? We just heard from Claire how it's important not to just talk about the number of days in but how people relate to each other, how work gets done. Have you found any ways of creating a, kind of, new way of working that will accommodate the flexibility that we need?\nDH: We've spent a lot of time supporting our leaders to think about this. So, I think there's just a general point here, which Claire alluded to, which is the job of a leader is becoming more and more complicated. It's not just about, you know, here are the work goals, get me the outputs. It's about people have choice about where they work, they've understood that they're, you know, the whole of them should be considered in the workplace. For years we've known that being able to answer positively to the question my boss or someone at work cares about me has a massive impact on level of engagement and how people feel about the organisation. I think, you know, the approach we've taken in Aviva is we give leaders a framework, we give them skills, we give them, you know, practical tips on how to manage flexibility in the wider sense, including working location, and then we allow them to make the decisions locally. So, give leaders a framework because, in my experience, most people want to know, kind of, what are the rules, how do things work round here but don't hold people too tight and then make sure that you've got masses of practical support on how do I have a conversation with my team about how we manage days in the office, what do I do if somebody says they really don't want to come in and, you know, we do, sort of, lead live streams on this topic as well and those are the sorts of questions we get. So, when someone says what do I do if someone in my team doesn't want to come in, I say well, you probably need to have a conversation with them because you should probably be quite worried about them because they're probably either disengaged or there is something else going on, you know, but try not to get into that, sort of, entrenched well, you have to come in because the organisation says, you know, that as leaders we're asking you to own this and when I was listening earlier to a point Claire was making, I was thinking especially in probably bigger organisations, the nuance of a message can very easily get lost because what can start as  look, we think around 50% of time in the office is probably right because of all these reasons, suddenly you speak to, you know, people who are talking to customers on the frontline and they say I've been told I have to be in two and a half days every week which means three days one week and two the next and you just go, where's all the nuance and the intent gone. So, I think as organisations, you've got to remember to come back to the why of what you're talking to people about rather than just focusing on a number.\nNC: I mean, it almost seems, Kevin, as if Dani and her team have, kind of, worked out all the, kind of, stuff that doesn't happen spontaneously and they've built things into their system and I'm wondering, in your organisation, where people are unashamedly getting on with things in accordance with whatever their bosses have set out for them, whether the conversations that ought to go on, the face-to-face, the spontaneous stuff, is going to happen spontaneously at all?\nKL: Well, I think conversations can take place and they can take place virtually and they can take place in person but a lot of parallels with what Dani was saying. Our approach has been to make sure that there is the framework, that there is resources, content, support for leaders. We rolled out a remote working policy. I think HR professionals have done absolutely brilliantly since the pandemic to pivot the way that organisations work. We've taken the lead in that. We can take immense pride in that in the HR profession, generally. Yet another area where we are leading in what organisations do but also leaders, when they get it, they start to be quite imaginative and start to think about how can we encourage employees to come into the office, for example. So, do we have scrum events in the office, do we have all hands events, do we offer a free breakfast, do we try to think about those days where we have less occupancy in the office. I think a recent stat' that I saw, saw the percentage of UK employees that work in an office on a Friday is just 13%. So, what can we do to maybe encourage more occupancy on those days. I think there's been some important, I want to come back, actually, to something that Dani was saying about engagement and I think it's really good in an organisation to look at the insights provided by the engagement data. What we have seen is we are very encouraged by the way our engagement scores have increased by a sizeable mean and we are getting good answers to certain key questions and good response levels, productivity seems to be up, So, we are confident at the moment that the way that we are working is moving in the right direction. I am still concerned about what I'm seeing about the playout of the mandated return to the office. I was concerned by the recent Pebble study that said of the 2,000 parents they surveyed, half of them said that they would have to leave the workplace because of the increasing nature of childcare costs. If you'd said to me before the pandemic, what are the two major rocks in the road to what I call true female equality, it would be the lack of flexible working and the lack of affordable childcare. So, there are still dangers that could come back to haunt us.\nNC: Okay. I want to try and draw a few conclusions, leave people with some positive tips, perhaps. I'll come to Claire at the end because she, kind of, pulls all of this together at the CIPD but Dani, some quick wins maybe, things people can do perhaps who aren't as far along the path as you?\nDH: I think decide what your organisation wants to do and why, what the purposes of offices are. Get some data, talk to your leaders about what works because they will know what works but just understand that in the absence of data, the reason this is one of the trickiest issues we've ever dealt with is because every single individual has a view on hybrid working and that view is informed by their personal choice and what you have to do is try and get that off the table to start to have sensible, commercial but people-focused conversations.\nNC: Kevin Lyons?\nKL: I think to build on what Dani has said, I think organisations need to embrace flexibility and embrace technology, make the mindset shift and work can be really exciting and productive and employees can have what they really want which is meaning, purpose and wellbeing at work within a flexible format.\nNC: Okay, and Claire McCartney, we're talking here all the time about ways to foster or rebuild a positive organisational culture, to bring people together whether they are working onsite, offsite or a mixture of the two. Again, any tips for us to finish?\nCM: Yeah. I think the crucial role of people managers. So, getting our people managers up to speed, to be able to, you know, really manage teams successfully, to think about ways of collaborating, connecting to the organisational purpose but I think, you know, overall, it's about normalising flexible working for all. It shouldn't be for certain groups and if it is, we start to get a bit of a stigma associated with it. So, actually, what we need is flexible working across the board, not just hybrid. We're here to talk about hybrid but as Dani started off, we need to think about those people in frontline roles and non-office workers as well. It's incredibly important. So, let's get that conversation going and progress it further.\nNC: Thank you so much to Claire McCartney, to Dani Harmer from Aviva and Kevin Lyons from Pearson for making this such a thoughtful and practical discussion, symbolic maybe for this 200th edition. You can just see how much our working lives have changed since our first podcast. We'd love some of your feedback about this edition. Your thoughts, for example, on how we balance where people work now and, indeed, how or whether business culture matters in people management and you can do this via the CIPD podcast page or LinkedIn. This seems a good time for me to thank the unheard but always creative and supportive CIPD duo of Derek Tong and Christian Adams who make this podcast happen every month and the top technical team at Listen but, for now, from me Nigel Cassidy, for the 200th time, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "Despite increased resources in most organisations, CIPD’s 2023 Learning at Work survey found that over half of L&D teams had intensified workloads over the last year. This has left L&D professionals battling with a lack of capacity, puzzling over business priorities and with a lack of insight about what is needed. So, what can learning professionals do about it?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Sonali Narendran, Talent and Learning Partner at Starbucks; Laura Overton, Founder at Learning Changemakers; and Andy Lancaster, Head of Learning at CIPD, as we explore a number of practical solutions to help you overcome capacity barriers and deliver impactful learning.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 35:19\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: The pressure is on to deliver more workplace learning. So, if you can't just work any harder, could you work smarter? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow learning and development types probably don't need the CIPD's latest survey to tell them that training workloads are through the roof. Yes, staffing and budgets have gone up a bit, but learning and development teams find they still need to boost their capacity to keep up with the insatiable demand. How can you deliver yet more learning in the face of competing priorities, time constraints and the sheer complexity of organisations? All potential barriers to plugging those skills gaps. Well hopefully we're going to get a lot of tips on how to do all this. With us, a talented learning partner at Starbucks who in the past has also worked at Marks and Spencer and HSBC, she says her job is about building a culture of everyday learning, so people bring their authentic selves to work. It's Sonali Narendran. Hello.\nSonali Narendran: Hi.\nNC: Laura Overton is an award -winning independent learning analyst, speaker and facilitator. Her focus, among other things, is on practical ideas to make learning more effective for a business. And Laura's the founder of consultancy Learning Changemakers. Hello.\nLaura Overton: Hello everyone.\nNC: And from the home team a welcome return to the podcast for Andy Lancaster, CIPD's head of learning. He's an author and noted speaker with more than 30 years experience, spreading the word about creative learning, design and delivery. Hello Andy.\nAndy Lancaster: Yep, great to be here and also great to welcome all the other guests on this one, looking forward to the time together.\nNC: So, Andy, workloads really increasing and that does put the pressure on sometimes.\nAL: It does, but I think what the Learning at Work Survey 2023 shows very clearly is there's some brilliant opportunities for learning professionals, but with those opportunities come some challenges. So, if we think about private sector organisations, we're seeing some real opportunities and challenges around and growth and productivity and reduction of costs. And if we think about what the report shows us around public sector organisations, there's a real priority around skills shortages and how we develop skills, organisational culture and those kind of things. So, I think there's a brilliant opportunity and I think sometimes it's really important that we frame this in the context of the contribution and the impact that learning professionals can have. And what clearly the survey is showing is there are workload increases, but these are linked to very practical things we can do to have a real impact on the context that we're working in.\nNC: And Sonali, if we think of the skills that anybody would need to serve us well in a coffee shop, there's an awful lot to learn in a short time, I would guess, if you take somebody on. So how do you ensure that you're imparting those skills in the best way?\nSN: Definitely, it is a complex job. I mean, God, if I were ever a barista, I don't know if the coffee shop is going to run for very long or not because it is such a difficult job. But one thing that I have seen us do brilliantly well is upskill our baristas and our store managers and our shift supervisors and thinking about how is it that, you know, they feel absolutely confident, but also motivated every day to come in and do a fabulous job. So, we have a combination of two things. So, there is a digital platform that ensures that our skills training for our baristas is scalable. And we lean into gamification a lot because that helps and that has shown evidence of how learning is retained and also been able to apply it in practice. But then on the other hand, there is there is a very, very structured development path that is, that is crafted and shared with all levels across our store operations. And that ensures that everyone is really clear about their responsibility. What are the skills that are required for them to do their job brilliantly well and how are those skills developed? So, I think it's a two pronged approach and that combination is serving us really well.\nNC: Well, this is good news, isn't it, Laura? Because if we think of the skills shortages in organisations and across the UK, the skills gap, this more sophisticated way of working is what we need.\nLO: Absolutely. And it's one of the things that we picked up on in the work report. It's just how we're applying really sensible evidence informed strategies into our practice. And Sonali, you just really helped us to see that you helped us to show how your baristas have been kind of, the kind of a framework and a purpose so they understand where they're going, they understand how they're going to get there. They have the opportunity to practice, they have the opportunity to pick up new knowledge, they have opportunity to reflect, they have opportunity to contribute. And these are all the kinds of evidence and practices that really deliver impact. That's the bottom line of it. And I think that's one of the things that we really need to focus on is to get away from learning and development as being producers of programs and content that people have to consume to creating the kind of experiences that Sonalia has just described that will allow us to kind of practice and become those people, become those skilled people, not just know about them, not just talk about them.\nNC: I think, look, Laura, I think there's a really good pickup from what you've both said there that under work pressure, sometimes we need to simplify and not get more complex. And I think this takes me back to, you know, scaffolding learning theory, which, you know, is an old principle but we look about how do we engage learners interest? How do we provide clear instructions, clear goals? How do we allow people to practice, spaced repetition, which we know is one of the most important things for skills development.\nAL: So, I think Nigel, if we think about this whole area here, whilst workload might be going up, there are some very practical and simple things we can do to deliver really effective solutions, as Sonali has said, but maybe one of the skills we need as learning professionals here is to step back, think and simplify the processes. The over kind of complex just doesn't always deliver for us.\nSN: And if I can also add, Andy, because sometimes it does happen that the next new shiny technology is what takes your interest. And I feel just thinking back to some of my previous experiences and now at Starbucks, I think in the past, I've seen organisations really over complicating the whole skills framework. And I think they've gone on the complete other end of the spectrum. At Starbucks, we absolutely see the opportunity to, yes, it's very simple, maybe is it too simple? So, I think we do have an opportunity there, but luckily, we're not struggling with it being so complex that no one's able to navigate it. So, I feel like it's also being really cautious about which technology would serve you. And do you really always need technology? I think we're back in the world where connection is so important, and especially in a store operation environment. I think it is about what partners learn from each other and how they get motivated, coached, encouraged by their store manager. And I think you need time and space and connection for that. And of course, needless to say, when you think of what it looks like in a support center or leadership space, you have to completely pivot and think about, again, very creative, simple ways of how you engage those learners because they have different challenges.\nNC: Right. So, Laura Oton, I did notice in this survey that the use of external training supplies has fallen a bit. Is that one reason why internal departments maybe are a bit overworked?\nLO: To be honest, I actually don't think it's because we are using less external departments that give giving us this opportunity for overwork. I actually think it's because, you know, since the pandemic, the demand for learning has just gone through the roof. I think one of the things that the study shows is that business priorities are all linked to growth productivity, How do we build new skills to be relevant for the future? Are people priorities? How do we keep people? How do we retain people? How do we think about succession planning? It all points to the skills issue. And often the learning and development departments are asked for more and more courses and content. Last time we did the study two years ago, and if you remember, you know, sort of our workloads were going up by something like 50% and it's the same again. So, this is something that's really, really important for us is to how do we manage that? I'm just so pleased, Sonali, that you're here as well, because it's like, you know, has this been an issue for you as well?\nSN: I would say that, yes, the workloads have been going up. And one of the reasons why I was fascinated by this topic and by all of these reports, whether it's the CIPD report or the LinkedIn Learning Workplace report, I think all of them are talking about some very, very important and critical behaviours and trends that are coming up. And the reality is that the world's not going to slow down. The reality is that the war for talent is not getting any better. And the reality is that we are moving much faster than we have in the past. So how do we stay agile and nimble and creative and clever in the way we think about capacity and in the way we think about how we manage workloads for ourselves as learning professionals is something that really fascinates me.\nNC: And can I just ask you, Sonali, in practical terms, we know that coffee shops had a hard time during the pandemic. Turnover staff can be quite high. So, what does kind of pressure mean to you?\nSN: For us, it is thinking about how do we elevate the partner experience end to end. I think that is the critical thing. It isn't so much about one aspect or one component of a partner life cycle. By the way, I should clarify that at Starbucks, we are all called partners and not employees or colleagues. So, it is important for us to understand and not look at learning in isolation. And then equally at the same time, be very mindful and aware of what is the kind of workforce that is joining the organization because that varies quite significantly between what we see in the stores versus what we see in the support centres. And just the fact that we've got multi -generations working in and across the organization, it is the bigger challenge for us as learning is how do you ensure you're catering to these different kinds of learning requirements and learning needs and preferences. So, the pressure is high in terms of how we respond to that. But like I was saying before, Nigel, it needs to be, we need to be more end -to -end holistic in our approach and in our design, rather than just thinking that learning is going to be the silver bullet.\nNC: Okay, so Andy, we've got this pressure. People will feel it in different ways, won't they? So how would you suggest people start by kind of deciding what they ought to be doing, which I guess may not be necessarily what senior managers think they should be doing?\nAL: Well, I think the evidence from the report is really clear that if you look at what the priorities are in terms of organisations and businesses and learning professionals, there is a synergy with those things. So, I think to pick up on Sonali's point, I think we're looking at what are the key drivers here? Now, if we look at the actual stats here, and I think evidence-based learning is really important for us, improved customer services right up there, productivity, how do we now improve organisational cultures? So, I'm not sure Nigel, there is a disconnect between senior leaders and learning teams. I think that is very much narrowed. And I think for me, the pandemic, there are not many good things that have come out of the pandemic. But one of those was a laser focus for learning departments during that season, whether it be for someone like Sonali working in that customer facing more kind of hospitality, or whether you're working in healthcare or manufacturing, the pandemic clearly laser focused what we need to do in terms of our learning provision. So, I think starting off with where the business is going, where the organisation is going, is really important. It's also interesting in there as well, Nigel, just looking at some of the statistics around this, some of the things that learning professionals are picking up on as being a starting point, staff retention, not only finding great staff, but keeping great staff. Well-being is way up there. I'm not sure well-being would have been as high on our agenda now. Succession planning, those kind of things, developing leadership. So, I think that the data we have here shows quite clearly that there are some key organisational drivers, and that is the starting point. I mean, the moment we maybe want to come on to what we can actually do in terms of our practice. But I think for those listening in, the key thing is we need to look at the organisation is doing. I think Sonali has framed that so brilliantly around what that means at Starbucks, and I think every organisation now we are getting better at understanding what the organisation needs.\nNC: Andy, you're quite right. We'll get onto those practicalities very soon. But just while we're talking about some of the findings in the survey, I just want to put something else to Laura. And that is the question of training effectiveness. I mean, there's no point in showing you've put more people through on the same budget if they haven't retained anything. I was shocked to see that just 8% of those surveyed were prioritising speeding up the transfer of learning into the workplace. I mean, what is the point of any training if it doesn't have a positive outcome, Laura?\nLO: No, we all want to make a contribution to positive outcomes. And I think the challenge has been is that we've been prioritising the input into that learning process. We prioritise what kind of content, what kind of programmes, what kind of initiatives... We're giving people and we were really deliberate this year in asking questions about what happens across the whole of the learning process. What happens when you go back to work and it's really clear from the statistic that you picked up is that that's not a key for us right now. But we're looking at this big skills agenda about really changing the way that individuals, teams and organisations are able to adapt and be agile to changing customer requirements and changing environments. Then we really do need to start to look at some of those ways of extending learning transfer. So yes, it's shocking, but Nigel, that's the point of a report. The point of a report is, let's stimulate some conversation. Do we mind that it's this low? Is it representative of our organisation? Are we doing something in one project, but we're not doing it across all projects? These are the types of conversations that we hope this kind of report will stimulate in the community. So, thank you for raising that one. There's a whole chapter on how we can improve our impact on that and how we can work with others as well. So hopefully we will dig into what the statistics say, not just home in on one of them, but it's good to be able to stimulate our own thinking, challenge our own thinking and learning transfer is certainly an area that the report has highlighted that we need to think a little bit more deeply about.\nNC: Just to reiterate, we're talking here about the CIPD Learning at Work Survey 2023 and people can find that online. Sonali, you've been listening patiently to all that. How does this chime with your experience of trying to deliver the most bangs for your Starbucks?\nSN: Yes, yes, I know.\nNC: See what I did there? Bangs for your Starbucks.\nSN: I love that. Actually, I mean, I absolutely agree with everything Laura was saying. And this has become quite an important point of discussion and debate within my team as well. And as we are sort of working and brainstorming what our learning and talent strategy would be for next year. But more importantly, really questioning ourselves on how are we measuring impact? I think gone are the days when we rely on Kirk Patrick's four -stage model of measuring training effectiveness. And I personally, I'm quite averse to the word training effectiveness myself, so it's understanding how is impact being measured. And one of the things that I can see us doing a lot more of now as compared to my experience with HSBC or with M&S, is having really purposeful conversations with our business leaders, especially around their people strategy. That's your starting point. And that's where the connection and collaboration needs to happen with the business and learning to understand, what are the drivers for the business? And then how is learning going to contribute and support that to be able to assess and evaluate impact? I genuinely think we need to reframe our ways of measuring impact because if we are going to continue to be looking at bums on seats, then I think we are doing ourselves a disservice. Plus, also there's unnecessary pressure on us because we are not transferring the responsibility or accountability of development and learning to the individual, to the business, to the manager and it's continuing to stay with learning when that is not how it should be.\nNC: OK, Andy Lancaster, let's go into a bit more detail then. You've already mentioned how COVID kind of changed overnight, how we do things. Could you talk a bit more about how you move on when you're under these capacity pressures, if you like?\nAL: And this kind of links in and the thread continues about learning impact. So, it's not just pain, it's opportunities as well. That's the starting point we go from. And I think when we are immersing ourselves in those things, there is a natural fallout in terms of being able to see how learning and development is impacting the business. You know, I think how we get better at this, I think asking great questions is really important around this. I think, here's an example, so I'm just recovering from shoulder surgery. So, when I went in with the initial injury, my GP asked some very good questions of what was going on, what were the symptoms, how this had happened. So, it wasn't me telling him, can I have some painkillers? This was very much a holistic approach, really good questions. And he actually ended up diagnosing that it actually needed surgery. So, I think that diagnostic piece is really important. So, I think the first thing we're seeing and we're encouraging learning professionals is to really think through the presenting problem or presenting opportunity. And invariably, this is actually part of a more complex issue. So, we're talking about employee propositions or retention, those kind of things. This is part of a bigger thing. We need to recognize that we are systemic workers. We're not just the L &D team. We're part of a bigger people team, and we're part of bigger people processes. So, I think great questions. And in that diagnosis, it's really important to understand, is this a matter of knowledge transfer? Is this a matter of skills that we need to develop? A really important thing from the survey is highlighting that skills is a big agenda for most organisations. Is it a motivational issue? Is it a resourcing issue or an environmental issue? So, I think us being able to ask really, really good questions is really important. And that's about what do we need to do now? What do we not need to do? And I think, Nigel, in terms of workload as well, we have to sometimes say no to things. Now, there has to be some clear prioritization that we align with the business and say, these are the real clear priorities.\nNC: OK, I get all that. There are so many ways of delivering our learning now. Laura, can you talk a bit about finding the right blend, if you like? I mean, obviously a lot of people have moved over to hybrid working, to everything online, very little classroom learning in some places, but if you're trying to, again, get the most value, how do you kind of work out whether you've got the right mix?\nLO: I cannot emphasise enough how important that is, but we also have to believe that our response to what we find out is going to be appropriate as well. Do we believe that we're going to be delivering value back into the organisation? And that means being curious about what's going on around us and then being curious about how we can respond to that in the most appropriate way. And there's a lot in this report that looks at technology and it looks at the ways that we're using technology and the way that we're using classroom and the way that we're using secondments and the ways that we're using apprenticeships and opportunity to practice back into the workplace. And as Andy says, you know, these solutions potentially are, need to be a systemic solution, one that goes across the whole of the organisation. So, it's not about creating programmes of training and content anymore, whether it's classroom, blended, hybrid, it's about creating the opportunity to learn a new skill. And that's where I'm very excited about what the report is kind of starting to flag and highlight for us. I think the question about is this blended, is this hybrid, is the wrong question to be asking. Because in most of our minds, what that means is, how do I blend face to face with online?\nThat's the wrong approach. That's the wrong lens to look at. What we need to be thinking about, how do we blend opportunities to learn from each other? How do we blend opportunities to practice? How do we blend opportunities to reflect and engage? How do we blend opportunities to find the thing that we need, just at the point that we need it? How do we blend opportunities to share back into the organisation? That I think is where we're going to really start to see skills, initiatives really take off and we're starting to see glimmers of that. Sonali, you're nodding quite a lot there. Does any of that resonate with what you're doing at the moment?\nSN: Oh my God, every single word, Laura, because this is the other thing that I'm trying to really dial up in the way we are positioning what we do as a centre of excellence or just the fact that how we see ourselves as true enablers to business performance and individual excellence is about impact.  It's about value and it is about how, I mean, how could you imagine the different channels in the ways you can create that, whether, you know, someone prefers to use 70, 20, 10, whether someone prefers to use a different sort of hybrid or virtual or face to face, whatever that language is for you. I think the key thing is what is the learning experience and impact that is delivering, right? So, I think one of the really big things that I have been focusing on and I know at Starbucks is really important is this whole concept of experience. We have moved away from calling ourselves a training provider or learning provider or, you know, here are some workshops. I mean, yes, tactically, that's some of the language you would use. But in our narrative, it's all about experience, whether that be careers, whether that be development, whether that be performance, it is all thinking about creative experiences that enable learning, sharing, collaboration, challenge, provocation, and design thinking, new ideas, experimentation. That is really the crux of it because I am so with you that gone are the days when we, and I just feel like that's a debate that is so per-se now about whether it should be hybrid or whether it should be face to face.\nAL: It's really energizing for me to hear about that human-centered approach, Sonali. I mean, I think this is, and this comes back to the key theme about we have got more work pressures, we've got more to deliver but that learner-centered approach is so important because without that we're guessing sometimes at what we need to do.\nNC: Do you think sometimes organisations, or do you think learning departments think they're learner-centered but actually they aren't?\nAL: Yes, I think just the same as customer-focused organizations think they're customer-focused and they aren't. You know, what I think Sonali has highlighted quite importantly is that here is that learning teams are making this shift and we see this quite widely now that there is a much more learner-centred focus here. So, if we come back to the theme, the report is showing that the workload is high. It is so important, so important that we know that what we're going to deliver is really going to scratch the itch or is really going to meet those needs. So, I think, yes, Nigel, I think we can go further, but I think the evidence would be over the last few years and perhaps the pandemic has helped us in this. We are more business aligned. We are more sensitive to what the business needs. We are more sensitive to what the learners need and that can only be a good thing in terms of really laser focusing the efforts we make to really have the maximum impact.\nSN: I'm very conscious that to move our listeners might be thinking, well, it's easy for you to say that we don't talk about hybrid or don't talk about face to face, but that is my practical challenge, right? That's what I'm facing into every day. But believe me, we were there. I mean, we're not completely out of it. We're still in that phase of, Andy might remember, I'd use the word, it's the year of experimentation on one of our calls before. And that is the whole point of it, that can we be brave enough as learning professionals to give ourselves some space to try our different things? And if we take a particular piece of content or experience and try and do it in a few different ways to then figure out where is the best impact, where is the best value, rather than getting sort of stuck and going down a rabbit hole to say, oh, I just need to do this face to face, I just need to do this virtual. So all I would say is that it's not to say it's not an issue. I think it's about thinking, how do you experiment to try different ways to find what's the best solution?\nNC: And Laura, there is tendency as we sort of talk about this, to think this is still learning and development people delivering a service to achieve whatever the aims of the training should be. But of course, it's all about galvanising managers. I'm sure Sonali might have something to say about this. How can you kind of tell if you're getting the right and enough support from line managers, from people on the ground? So, you're not doing learning in a vacuum.\nLO: I think it's really interesting that you've kind of phrased it that way, because certainly in the research that I've been\nNC: I'm in trouble again.\nLO: (Laughs) No, I love it. The way that you phrased it is, how do we think we're getting the right support? You know what, I'd like to flip that. How do we give the right support to managers? And that's the question I think this report has kind of been generating for me and certainly the research and the evidence that's been surfacing through CIPD and other research over the years is how to equip my managers to be able to support their teams better. Nigel, I really enjoyed the podcast that you did with colleagues on the role of line managers and how the kind of pressures that line managers are under. It was so powerful. And if we think we've just got to give them another thing to do, add on more learning on top of more recruitment, on top of more wellness, on top of more, and on top of their day job, it's just craziness. So, we do need to rethink how we support line managers. And Sonali, I just want to pick up on you saying about, you know, we need to experiment. We need to sit down and say, look, this is the problem we're all trying to work on. What can I do? What are you already doing? How can I help you? How can we join up the dots? And I think that that's the opportunity that we have and this report highlights. Certainly, we've seen that those business leaders who value the learning contribution of learning and development professionals in this report. What we're actually seeing is we are seeing more experimentation, we're seeing more support of managers, we're seeing more co -working with managers, we're seeing more use of broad ranges of technology to start helping us to address some of these challenges that technology isn't just about content and administration, but it's about how we make connections and maybe take off some of the pressure of all of us in this learning journey. So, I don't think Nigel, we should be saying, how can we get more from them? But how can we help them do their jobs smarter and better? And as a result, also do our jobs smarter and better as well.\nNC: Okay and Andy Lancaster, if the workload is high, as we said at the beginning, clearly L&D professionals need to be at the top of their game. So, I just wonder whether you've got any thoughts on what should be on people's personal professional development plans?\nAL: So, I think for us, there's no one thing you can say here. I think what we need to do is very contextual here. And I think I just want to throw in the mix here that reflection is really important. I think where we see organisations that are doing well in terms of learner-centred design, in terms of tracing impact and driving impact, I think there's a real reflective practice in here, which is part of not only the learning process, but also part of managers working on this as well. So, the starting point for each of us is a really good self -assessment and reflection on what we need. And it's very easy just to throw things out like, well, AI is really important and there are some truths around technology. But it isn't just about AI for some people. You know, certain organisations have very different priorities. So, I think it is for each team, for each professional to be very reflective and that needs to be linked very much to where the strategy is at. So, I think the advice we would give on creating great professional development plans to any member of staff is it starts with really strong reflection. I think as professionals, we need to get a bit better at that. And I think as well, the workload sometimes cuts across that because reflection requires us to take time. So, I think for each of us it is stepping back and recognizing what we need to do ourselves and there may be technologies around this, but I think there's a whole range of other things. And I'm just really heartened that we're talking about learner-centered design, human-centered design. There's a lot of thinking around that, brilliant thinking from design sectors around this, and if only we grasp that more. So, yet, reflective practice, Nigel, is my starting point on this one. We've all got to get much better at really understanding our own scenarios and our own needs.\nNC: So, trying to draw this to a close to and Sonali Narendran, from your own experience at Starbucks, what would you say are the most useful things you can do to be delivering more effective learning development?\nSN: I would actually share some very, very practical tools that our listeners can either look up or they might be using a version or those tools themselves. For me, the most fundamental going back to design thinking is opening every conversation with the question, what problem are we trying to solve? None of my conversations, I can't remember if they've ever started without that question because that gets me to really hone in to what is the crux of the situation and where should we be focusing rather than talking about everything under the sun. And of course, that then sort of branches out in different directions. The second one again linked to some very specific methods. My favorite, some of my favorite methods that I have been using for some time now are retrospective. Now, retrospective is a tool that lots of people would be using, but it is, it's a really, really helpful tool to think about how are we doing and where are we going, and it just helps again have a very focused and structured conversation. But looking at some of the prioritisation tools that are available and thinking about how you could use them and going back to Andy's point around technology is, are we even leveraging some of the simple collaboration tools that are available to us so that we are, we are running most effective meetings, and our conversations are really productive and meaningful and have a bias to action around it. And the last one is something that I actually personally started a year ago, and it has helped a great deal is what I call my big bets for every quarter. And my big bets for every quarter arrive from whether that be our talent discussions, whether that be discussion with the business, and it is then ensuring you, you know, sharing and socialising with the right stakeholders to communicate that and to ensure that what you're doing are the right priorities and, and also then helping me and my team to stay focused and not feel like overwhelmed and that we are doing, you know, so many different things but not really driving the right impact.\nNC: Brilliant. Thank you for that. Laura Overton, some of what Sonali said very much chimes with something I've heard you say about what people ask for and what they actually need.\nLO: Yes, that's a good thing. I'm often asked what would you like to drink Laura? I want to say of course I would love a glass of wine, what I actually need is eight glasses of water a day and I think Nigel, what we ask for as learning professionals is often, oh we need more money, I need more technology, I need more budget, I need more, my headcount but what we actually need is to drink that water every day. We need to reflect as Andy said we need to try things out, we need to be retrospective and be able to think forward. We need to ask the right questions. They need to be cognizant of just doing that basic, keeping hydrated on good practice and being aware and cognizant of what we are doing ourselves as a community and I think that's the thing that really is kind of missing. We are cobbler's children when it comes down to building our own skills and we need to start to drink the basics, experiment on ourselves if we can't experiment on anyone else. Let's try new things and let's see whether or not we can really bring our sharpest, smartest selves to the workplace.\nNC: Brilliant. Well, thanks to our trio, Laura Overton, founder of Learning Changemakers, Sonali Narendran from Starbucks and the CIPD's Andy Lancaster. Next month, would you believe, it's the 200th CIPD podcast. Yes, 200 and not out. So please subscribe where you get your podcast, so you don't miss that milestone or any other edition as it's published.

      "summary": "Is your cybersecurity training fit for purpose? There’s a common perception that cybersecurity is an issue for the IT function, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. The reality is that modern cyber-criminals have mastered the psychological techniques of manipulating their target to perform a specific action, making the issue of cyber-security a far more human issue than you may think. So, how can people professionals get on top of the issue, better understand their people and then identify where the risks might lie?\nJoin host Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Shelby Flora, Managing Director at Accenture; Tim Ward, CEO at ThinkCyber; and Tarquin Folliss OBE, Vice Chairman at SASIG as we unpack the human side and behavioural science of cybersecurity.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 35:45\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Watch out, cybercriminals about!\nBut it's not so much your technology as your people who are your greatest risk.\nI'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow, you might be thinking this podcast about cybersecurity is probably one for the IT Department or your Security Officer if you have one. Well, think again, because in 9 out of 10 cases where cybercriminals come knocking, it's the organisation's own workers who unwittingly open the door. So, given that HR isn't by tradition a cybersecurity guardian or a risk manager, how can it ensure that people take more care and maybe even spot or head off a financially devastating attack?\nWith us, a trio of cybersecurity experts with a deep knowledge of this \"people risk\" and how to combat it.\nTim Ward is co-founder of ThinkCyber. A security and IT specialist, he applies behavioural theory to transform people's security awareness. Hello Tim!\nTim Ward: Good morning.\nNC: Tarquin Folliss was a long-serving senior diplomat, focussing on national security policy. He's now Vice-Chairman of the \"Security Awareness Special Interest Group\" which is in \"Industry for Leadership\", a networking forum. Hello Tarquin!\nTarquin Folliss: Good morning.\nNC: And Shelby Flora is MD of Accenture Security, with a clutch of Fortune 100 clients. She's driven by a keen interest in the intersection of humans and technology. Hopefully mainly humans today. Hi Shelby!\nShelby Flora: Hello.\nNC: I mean threats to steal data or money or to bring an organisation down are just so many and varied, aren't they? I mean, it could be hacking your social media, getting passwords, phishing, sending bogus emails asking for information, ransomware demands, hijacking files or this thing I struggle to get my head round sometimes, distributed denial of service attacks which flood your website and then try to extort money. Now, from what I've read, most incidents, I mean the vast majority. are human enabled. I mean, people are supposed to be your strongest asset but it looks to me like they're your weakest link.\nTF: That's part of the problem that we talk about, and I think Tim will probably go into that in more detail. But, I mean, that is an issue about the culture of organisations and how they look at their people, so I don't think talking about people as the weakest link is probably the most positive way of looking at it. You have to look at how you can make people more resilient. You know, inevitably, the crimes that are committed against organisations are committed by human beings and they feel most comfortable targeting human beings. They are the easiest access point, rather than trying to hack through technology which is actually quite time-consuming and expensive.\nSF: Yes, I think it's also interesting to, kind of, understand the history of the human attack surface. Cybersecurity wasn't really on the top of anyone's tongue 10 or 15 years ago but it very much is so now, you know, the headline breaches are all too frequent now and oftentimes they have been attributed to some sort of human fallibility, whether it was malicious or negligent in intent. And we saw that number rise drastically, almost like an exponential curve, through the last many years. However, it has been interesting to see that that number has slightly gone down in the last two or three. It peaked at about 90, when you look at the Horizon breach report or the World Economic Forum analysis. It did top out at near 90%, which is really worrisome, but it has slowly gone down, it was 87%, 85. But still very disproportional to where investments are made in the cyber-resilience of an organisation, less than 5% of budgets are actually spent on shoring up the human firewall. So, it is something to be very much aware of and paying attention to in figuring out ways to shore it up for an organisation.\nNC: So, Tim, from your experience as a security practitioner, how would you assess the state of security awareness if you like and the importance of the culture of the organisation in whether it gets sorted?\nTW: Yeah, I mean, culture is fundamental to this, and I suppose that's where the HR side of this comes in. I think, our traditional approaches to tackle this have not been that effective because we've thought of this as an education and training issue and I suppose initially it was because people really didn't know anything about this.\nSo, we've turned to e-learning as the traditional solution. I think now, generally, people do understand some of the threats and e-learning once a year is obviously not quite keeping up with the fact that those threats are evolving constantly. So, we need to think of new things, and, unfortunately, the industry landed upon quite a clever thing, which was to run these simulations and phishing simulations and to test people, and essentially to trick people which created a really useful measure, and cybersecurity's quite hard to measure, and so it created this fantastic measure where you could tell your bosses that the click rate was this number and look, all the controls we're now putting in and we're reducing that click rate. Unfortunately, that's got us into a little bit of a consequences culture where I think we're almost using this to blame people and say, \"look, people are stupid, they're clicking on these links\". Now, 9 times out of 10, most of us come to work and our job involves clicking on links, so if we, every now and then, get caught out by sometimes very sophisticated emails, then that's naturally going to happen.\nSo, I think, it's worth stepping back and thinking about culture and where the whole organisation has a part to play.\nAnd the important thing now, I think, is that everyone feels safe (psychological safety), they feel safe to report, to ask questions and say \"look, I don't understand this or I think I've made a mistake - help\". And actually, cybersecurity teams need that because the sooner you hear about a problem happening, the more time you've got to try and do something about it.\nNC: This is a very powerful point, Shelby, that Tim is making because the reality is modern cybercriminals have mastered these psychological techniques to manipulate us to perform a specific action. I mean, it is a bit much to put it down to somebody's gullibility, isn't it? I've heard there are even corporations that have a zero-tolerance policy, you know, one lapse breaking the security rules and you're out. So, I mean, you're not going to admit to anything, are you? You're just going to cover it up and hope it's all right?\nSF: Yeah, I really do think this attack factor, the human firewall or the human attack surface is due for a bit of a renaissance, as both Tarquin and Tim were alluding to.\nNC: Sorry, a \"human firewall\", this is a thing?\nSF: Yes, it's part of that flip in lexicon, but also in sentiment as well, because when you think of organisational culture, you, you , it always needs to match how the organisation is wanting to position itself in the market and as a lot of organisations have gone through this paper-digitisation over the last decade, it is part of the day-to-day. And so, when we're working with organisations, we also like to frame this skill-building, just as you would expect your leaders, you know, management and above, to have this as acumen. To make the sound decision for the business.\nCyber acumen is, quite frankly, the new business acumen and everyone has a role to play. Now this will vary, executives need to be making sure that all the right regulatory obligations are met in this regard and all the assurances are in place, but managers need to be savvy enough to ask the right questions of their teams when they're looking to bring new technology into the environment, as well as just the day-to-day awareness that the bad guys and gals are looking for a way to break in to do the mischievous activities. And oftentimes, humans, when we're knocked out of homeostasis, tend to be susceptible to that. So, I think the reframing of the \"human firewall\" and skilling as part of being a digital company is really where we're going to get some momentum over the next couple of years.\nNC: But, of course, in spite of precautions, this happens to organisations when they don't expect it. Tarquin Folliss, I know people in your forum may have come to you because of some kind of an incident. Can you just talk a little bit about the repercussions for organisations, particularly the people issues that maybe people haven't expected. I mean, there are obvious things you have to do, like shutting down servers and changing passwords and all that, but there's a lot of other issues that will suddenly arise.\nTF: I was once asked, by a journalist, a question, which was \"How should the IT function view cybersecurity?\", and I wrote back saying \"If you're thinking about it just as the IT function, you've got a massive problem in your organisation. This is something that impacts across the whole piece and, in fact, it's very much a Board issue. So, when you talk about an attack taking place or an incident taking place, actually for a large number of organisations, they don't realise they've been attacked until quite a long way into the incident itself and if they're not prepared for it, if they haven't done the training, the exercising etc., the running through playbooks, it can feel an enormous pressure on them to respond and that's when mistakes happen so, the impact upon an organisation can be financial, it can be reputational. It depends on what has been taken, it actually depends on whether the organisation can identify what's been taken or how it's been properly attacked and what further vulnerabilities exist.\nSo, it can be incredibly disruptive and we tend to think of these incidents as taking place and being, you know, when we train and exercise, we do it over a day. The incidents themselves to resolve, can take months to resolve and sometimes they cannot be resolved at all. If we look at Solar Winds, for example, we know there are vulnerabilities in one of their software, but companies are still using their software because it's ubiquitous and because they can't get rid of it.\nNC: And, Tim Ward, they can be unexpected, when an organisation is using a third-party provider, a managed service provider, somebody who's basically looking after the IT for them, this third-party is hacked. They kind of feel that it's all out of their hands and that they had a vulnerability they didn't even know about.\nTW: Yes, I think, third-party and supplier risk is becoming a very big topic in cybersecurity at the moment because you can work really hard to secure everything that feels like it's in your control, but then obviously your suppliers are not in your control. I think it was Target that was probably one of the first ones that brought this to people's attention. So, when they were hacked, it was actually an air conditioning company that was hacked. So that creates a massive risk for organisations and one that's quite hard to manage.\nI suppose the starting point there is to try and flow down some of your approach to security into those organisations, but that can get really difficult if you're talking about very small micro-organisations who are your suppliers, because not only could there be lots of them but they're very small and they haven't got the same sort of money to have the same sort of protections that you might have as a larger organisation.\nNC: So, Shelby Flora, you go into an organisation, you start working with them. What's your starting point? Again, particularly with HR and the people side of the business, to get to grips with how they are currently responding to cyber threats and how they can change?\nSF: One of the first things that when we're working with clients is that we want to make sure that the value of investing in the human firewall is known. And so yes, there's the avoidance of \"bad\" and the avoidance of a breach and all the timing costs that that can incur, but there's research including, some research that the World Economic Forum/Accenture recently performed, that organisations that embedded cybersecurity not only win leaders with the developer community and have the culture of cyber being part of the day-to-day, actually outperform their peers. They add to the top line. So, it's not just an avoidance of \"bad\", it's a positioning of \"good\". Oftentimes when organisations have landed, is they're just focussing on \"be smart, don't put down a phishing email\", versus how as a leader, whether you're manager of a developer community or manager of a customer channel's cyber and being aware of it is actually in the best interests of the organisation.\nSo, when we speak with our clients, we usually work in though 4 different dimensions. So, yes, there is the culture and the behaviours that you need to instil within an organisation. You need to break it down by persona, because what Joe Bloggs needs to do in finance is much different than manager Susan than developers versus exactly who's looking after a particular business unit. So, you work with them to understand what behaviours they're actually looking to change or they need to have within an organisation. Then it's about the skilling piece of it, which is, yes, you can launch nice-looking e-learning for the general workforce but tailoring it to the needs of the particular groups.\nSo, we have an adult-beverage brewing company that we were working with, and they had the ambitions to be the most connected brewer in the world and they knew that their own vestigial transformation and they knew that cyber was a part of it. So, yes, there was a workforce layer and we were trying to educate about, you know, \"don't put USB sticks in airport slots\" and be aware of spook phishing and spear phishing. But for the leaders it was, \"here's how you need to respond in the case of an incident and you are the captain of that ship\". So, it's working through the various dimensions and tailoring it per group and then doing behavioural changes of approach to get there. Because, just launching nice-looking e-learning at them is highly ineffective and quite costly.\nTW: I think bringing in the people side of this or the HR-side of this into it is really important. So, one of the conversations I have quite a lot with security practitioners is \"how can I do my job if the rest of the organisation thinks that this is just an IT problem?\". And so, when Shelby's going into an organisation, if that disconnect exists, it can be really, really difficult to help the organisation understand that this isn't just a technical problem. Because, at the end of the day, the assets that are at risk and the problems that are going to happen are business problems and those assets can be damaged by, I don't know, by flood or earthquake, and we're saying that they can be damaged by a technical issue happening, and so the governance and the structures the business puts around managing that should be normal business structures if that makes sense.\nAnd I think that's why there's a really important people angle to that, of helping people understand culturally, that the culture needs to value security, needs to understand security, and there's quite a lot of debate in this kind of \"do you need to build a certain security culture?\" And some people say \"oh, you can't change the culture of an organisation, it is what it is\" and so a kind of a spin on that is to say, \"OK, well that culture now needs to start to add on this \"valuing security\".\nAnd what can be really effective is if you can tie valuing security into the overall mission of the business.\nAnd I think that can work well with some businesses. For example, in the NHS, everyone cares about patients and patient safety and the outcomes for the patients. Well, them losing their data or them not being able to get their operation because of a cyber-attack, that's about the patient too. So, if you can pin the security aspect to the culture and to the main mission of the organisation, then that helps everyone in the organisation understand quite how important this is and the part they've got to play in it as well.\nTF: One of the big, big issues for most organisations is trying to get their head round what cyber is. Because it's virtual and nebulous, it's very difficult for people. I've dealt with some of the cleverest people I've come across and they've really struggled to understand what this means. As Tim and Shelby have pointed out, you've got to put it in a business context. If you don't understand cyber in the context of business risk then, as an organisation, you're going to really struggle, and that's probably the most important point to make in this podcast in many ways.\nNC: And of course, Tim Ward, the big thing that's changed everything is that so many more people are working at home, if not all the time, then some of the time, and lots of platforms have emerged to try and accommodate that, with, I expect you're going tell me, a lot more risk.\nIf organisations figure out these things, look at it from a business risk perspective and talk about, well, what does a cyber incident hack do to my ability to deliver my mission, then that's probably quite a long way to resolving the cultural issues about how an organisation deals with cyber.\nTW: Well, I think what's interesting about that, what a lot of security awareness practitioners realise, is that it needed us to start educating people on thinking about risk because we taught them about all these risks in a very specific manner, 'cos they were all based at work, and suddenly, they're at home and they, and they ... people need to be equipped to think about risk because things like \"Am I being overheard out the window\". I remember in the first lockdown, it was really, really hot and potentially people... everyone was working from home, you could be overheard out the window, you could be overheard through a wall if you lived in a house with not very thick walls. And if you work in certain organisations, that's quite a significant security risk. And so, if you've only trained people to think about very specific risks, then, and not to think about just \"how do I evaluate this situation I'm in and think about risk?\", but there's also quite a lot of psychological factors that come to play, so we're all a bit more relaxed potentially, ah, we haven't walked through the doors, we haven't walked past security guards, we might not be professionally dressed, we haven't got a lanyard on and so we're perhaps not thinking in such a secure way. We might be allowing our kids to use our device to go to certain pages so yeah, it has created lots of other security risks and perhaps one of those risks is that slightly more relaxed attitude: you're not thinking in quite such a switched-on way about, about the threats out there.\nSF: Yeah, I think also, with remote working, that was obviously spurred on by the pandemic it's a little bit of a double-edged sword. So, a firm - the technologists - like, oh, my goodness, you have all these devices for remoting into the network, you know, whether they're the technology controls ... but it actually was really beneficial from the education, from a general cyber hygiene perspective. A lot of organisations started pushing out information and training on the hygiene of making sure, rebooting our computers on a regular basis where you're normally, you're forced to do that in the office, coming in each day, making sure routers are up-to-date and encrypted properly. It's like, you can't really brought it home with times cyber-hygiene into our personal lives as well, which then creates more of an attachment to a... This is just the way the world works and this is how we stay safe and secure, and not only work devices but personal devices, there's this kind of like easy hygiene things that we can do, so, there's a little bit of a ??? that occurs and, fundamentally, it helps contextualise it for a lot of folks.\nNC: And another thing that was mentioned a bit earlier, Tarquin, was the question of testing people out. This whole issue of either profiling people or, worse, trying to entrap them in some way to test how likely they are to respond to a cyber-attack.\nTW: Well, I think there's an issue here and I know that Tim and Shelby have probably got really much greater depth of understanding of this, but I think there's an issue about what you're trying to do with your people. If you trick them, what kind of impact does that have upon them and their attitude towards the organisation? And does it actually help you to get the message across? Does it improve their ability to do the things they need to do? Does it actually make them want to be more secure? So, I think, when you're looking at this, you've got to look at that: what's the kind of message that you want to come across and how does it evolve your culture as an organisation? And profiling is actually quite a sensitive issue. I think, one of the things I would say is that I don't think you should profile individuals, I think, if you're looking at profiles, it's what Shelby talked about earlier, it's about roles, because each role in an organisation contains probably greater or lesser vulnerability to an attack. Or opportunity to an attack. An attacker's gonna be looking for particular avenues to get into organisations and, if a business is attuned to who are the most likely people to face that threat, then they can provide tailored education and training and advice and information to help those individuals be more secure.\nNC: I know, Shelby, you like to talk about attack surfaces...\nSF: Yeah!\nNC: We might think that's access points or the server or something like that, but that's people too.\nSF: Yes!\nYes, so, if we think about attack surfaces, the bad guys and gals are clever [laughs], but they are in this for a reason and so they are going to find the angles in, and so if we think about, you know, of recent notes and historical events, with Covid, we saw a lot of social engineering that was going on, the anxieties and heartstrings of everything that was going on with the global pandemic. You know, they were using relief messaging or, you know, a sustainable option, to try to trick people into giving in, using their credentials and such, but it's also interesting what we see as executives are becoming more and more visible within the environment. Honestly, with AI, it's gonna make it so much easier so we fully anticipate spear phishing to go up. And for those who aren't familiar, spear phishing is very targeted attempts at social engineering where folks are looking to be a bit devious by using references to something that's publicly available on social media or on the Internet to make you think that it is fact a real person that is reaching out in need. So, this brings us back to attack surface and understanding where your attack surface is. As the HR function is working with the security function to know where they need to provide support and coaching and education and structures, it's knowing that it's not a flat attack surface, there will be more parts in the organisation that have more risk, your visible executives. If you are an organisation that is part of, um, there's highly visible and an initiative, likewise your engineering group is always going to be very, very targeted, and that's visible only then...\nNC: And your people, management, your HR...\nSF: Exactly\nNC: They've got all the employee records...\nSF: Exactly. So, knowing that the risk profile will vary throughout the organisation, that's how an HR can help work with the security organisation and tailor their structures or their training or the coaching or the leadership enablement to help them be aware of and what to do in case they do find themselves targeted.\nTW: Going back to Tarquin's point about ethics and testing, I think a lot of this comes down to data. So, as a cyber security practitioner, you want to be able to show that you are improving the situation and the ideal there is to show that you have changed behaviour so, or you've reduced incidents, and obviously the behaviour is the leading indicator. So, people leapt on phishing simulations as a number that says \"look, I ran this test and 20% of my staff clicked on it. I've done some more work, I've trained them, and now only 5% click\". And that is so compelling because we like to measure things in business, don't we? And so that became a really good measure. But if you step back from it, you need to think about, well, what are you measuring, because if you make that test really hard, your click-rate will go really high again, and so it's not actually a particularly good measure. And obviously, you're tricking people. So, what some organisations are now thinking about is \"how do we gather other data in order to better understand behaviours\", and this risks going a bit into profiling. So, the important thing, I suppose, is a cultural one: \"why are you doing this?\". You're doing this to understand your threat profile and you're doing this to make sure, as both Tarquin and Shelby said, you target that training and education as effectively as possible. You're not doing it so you can say \"You keep making a mistake, you're sacked!\" Because if you get into that world, then you're, people are going to clam up and they're not going to share with you, they're not going to help you and they're not going to report things.\nTF: The big problem here is about that old chestnut of compliance versus assurance. So, a lot of organisations take on phishing programmes because they're required to by their customer. So that's not exactly changing behaviour, it's complying. And the trouble with compliance is that it's always a race to the bottom. It's about the most basic security requirements but it doesn't necessarily mean that an organisation is secure. So how we change that dynamic is quite important. This goes, I think, back to the whole point about how businesses operate. The other point I think I'd make is that if businesses put a lot of pressure on their people to achieve objectives or goals etc. then, with the amount of, and the NHS is a classic example, and I don't think the NHS is trying to do this, but doctors are under enormous pressure, nurses are under enormous pressure. They get lots of emails coming through. They've got to process those emails pretty quickly. And that really puts pressure on them when it comes to checking \"well, is that the right link I should be clicking or not?\". I think, Tim, you've got some data which talks about how people actually make decisions and most of the decisions we make aren't rational, are they?\nTW: No, no, absolutely. And the bad guys play to that all the time. I think Shelby alluded to it earlier that the phishing lures will tend to be trying to play to our cognitive biases. So, they'll be using authority against us, reciprocity, if they're trying to pretend to give you something, so you give something back. They'll be using social proof, all the, kind of, Amazon voucher-type phishing where they're trying to get you to go and buy Amazon vouchers and give you the codes. That's very much tends to authority, so pretending to be the CEO. And because we're all in a rush, then most of the time we're relying on shortcuts. So, we'll look at a few pointers in an email, we'll see \"Oh, it's from the CEO, they've asked me to do something, I'd better do it.\" But also, in that delivery focus situation, people will be cutting corners and going round security controls and so what's really important is that if you have a, really delivery focussed organisation, you highlight that delivery has to be done securely too and that matters to the organisation as well. It's not delivery at all costs. We've had conversations with some government-type stakeholders, where they have a real strong delivery focus and that creates real security problems because everyone's just trying to get the job done, no matter what.\nSF: So, the idea of getting tripped up, so there's one thing we know about human behaviour. They're consistently inconsistent. And so, I want to bring you back to the role of how an HR function can help with this, so actually I was just speaking with a healthcare client back in the US. They're having this kind of burn-out culture that's happening within their IT function right now because the CC and the powers that be are running a substantial transformation and they aren't staffed up fully enough and it's creating this burn-out: folks that are going out on medical leave and are working for too of long hours. And that poses a cyber risk because when folks are stressed and tired, some of them are more likely to make innocent mistakes, which is a way in for the bad guys and girls. So as an HR function that is trying to enable leaders within the organisation to make sure that the culture and balance of capacity is right, that is a key area in which they can contribute and shore up the human firewall.\nNC: Because, I think you were telling me, Tarquin, that often the chief security officer isn't on the board but HR is. So, they're in a good position here, if only people would listen.\nTF: Absolutely, and I also mentioned that in an exercise I was involved in with a big organisation, the head of HR, who was a woman, was making probably the most pertinent comments about how they should be dealing with it and she was being completely ignored. It may be because she was a woman that she was being completely ignored, but I suspect it was mainly because \"well, she's HR\" and \"what does she know about cyber?\". I think, given HR's critical role, their central role in dealing with people within the organisation, they also have a critical role to play in cyber.\nNC: But, of course, Tim, just playing Devil's advocate for a minute, where HR might be unprepared, things might be a bit different because people managers have to take a lot on board. We've heard throughout this discussion. I mean, do most even know the part they're going to have to play in data disclosure, in dealing with breaches, in dealing with the reputational harm. And then there's all this about enforcing data access and policing people who break the rules.\nTW: Yes, it's an interesting one, isn't it? I think people managers and HR, they need to... they don't need to be experts in cyber, I don't think that's quite what we're saying. They need to understand the people aspects of that, which I would expect to be standard. The people aspects... there's always going to be grievance processes, and disciplinary processes and processes that deal with stress and things like that. I suppose they just need to understand that those also have cyber implications or cyber might be causing some of those. I suppose the most important takeaway from this is that HR professionals should have an open door to cyber professionals and vice versa, because we quite often have conversations with practitioners who, there's a little bit of tension, in that Security know that they need to get some communication and some training out and some education and then they're having a little bit of a fight because potentially HR are saying \"well, look we've got all this other training as well\", so there's that kind of tension between the demands of cyber as a department or function with all the other demands. And I think, I mean, certainly in what we try to do, we're very focussed on making some of the training and awareness as low impact on people's time as possible, so keeping it tiny, short and more on-going so that you're having less impact. Because certainly, and I know we keep talking about the NHS, but people there have not really got the time to sit down and do an hour-long cyber course once a year, and frankly, there would be very little point, because they would forget it almost instantly. And so, you need to think much harder about how do you spread that across the year and how do you make it tiny little snippets and how you get it as close to the point of risk as possible. So, it's taking that behavioural lens we've already talked about and applying that to how you help people day-to-day.\nNC: Ok, well that's Tim's tip of the day and now we have to bring this to some kind of conclusion. Shelby Flora, what's the biggest lesson from your work with clients, how you move this forward?\nSF: This can seem like an insurmountable problem. You know, human attack surface, human firewall. Oh, my goodness, that means the entire organisation is fundamentally incurred to business risk, in business value, so as I mentioned, there is going to be some kind of obligatory, regulatory education that has to occur to meet the standards of the industry sectors that organisations are operating in. But then take a very targeted and tailored approach to the areas of the organisation that pose the most risk as well as value for cyber. Usually that's leaders, folks in IT, folks in Finance, Accounts Payable. Often there's a lot of social engineering in terms of asking money to be wired to all corners of the world. So, focus on that and don't just focus on the training. Think about the structures you need to enable, to make those folks, help them make the right decisions. I think oftentimes we don't think about the behavioural science components which are, \"what are the structures we need to put in place to make it easier?\". I use a very classic example. A lot of organisations not only want to prevent phishing but they want folks to report suspected phishing. So, instead of forcing your organisation to remember some random number, some random email box that they're supposed to forward it to, put the Report Phishing button in the email browser and so it's much easier. There's these are little behavioural science things you can do to make it easier for the organisation to make the right cyber decisions. HR will be thinking more like that whereas the cyber engineers, they want to \"out-tech\" the problem always and HR can help them think about it a bit more dimensionally and about the structures the organisation can put in place for that.\nNC: Great, and maybe a final bit of advice from you, Tarquin Folliss, maybe as a result of all the conversations you've had with people who have suffered from attacks but are maybe wiser now.\nTF: So, I think first of all, we should remember that most people aren't security specialists and when their function is to provide something else for the company, and now they're being asked to take this function on, and to be honest, it's quite alien for most people. They don't have to deal with that. So, I think that's one thing that people should.. those who are trying to implement a programme should remember: we're here to facilitate, rather than to impose further restrictions. Because as Shelby said, if further restrictions are imposed, people will find work-ways round it. And the other bit, there's two things that I think I'd say: make whatever programme you've got relevant to the people that you're targeting because then they'll take those lessons on, they really will see the value of it. And the other thing, which I think we've just touched on is this \"just\" culture. I think you've got to develop this \"just\" culture, which means that when somebody does click on a link or does something that they think they may have made a mistake, they can report it without feeling they're going to get absolutely clobbered by the management. In the end, with an incident, the quicker you know you've had a problem, the easier it is to resolve it, the less damage caused. The longer you wait or the longer it's delayed, the more damage it's going to cause and cyber moves at a phenomenal pace so \"just\" culture is a fairly critical and important part of this.\nNC: Brilliant, well, I'm off to change all my passwords straight away. Tarquin Folliss, Vice-Chairman of the Security Special Interest Group, Tim Ward, Founder of \"Think Cyber\" and Shelby Flora, MD of Accenture Security: a lot to consider, thank you all very much. I'll leave you with a couple of quotes I came across, you may have heard them before: \"Security isn't something you buy, it's something you do.\" and the other is, \"There are only two types of organisations: those that have been hacked and those that don't know it yet\".

      "full_text": "Duration: 30:49\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: When managers struggle so does productivity and team spirit. So how can people professionals support them better? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast. Like never before the fate of organisations is not so much in the hands of their high-profile leaders but day to day people managers. How effective they are can make or break organisations. Today, the people who are in charge of people are often overburdened and stressed, accountable for their team's personal well being, careers, performance, deployments and Lord knows what else. And it matters, I mean, if people hate their manager well when they get the chance they may leave. So how did it come to this? Is it time, human resource, professionals and people in learning and development and organisational development and design, used their skills to take some of the weight off their shoulders?\nWell three really top guests this month, all known as influential players with ideas to help people managers to cope and deliver. Well, firstly we're delighted to welcome the author and keynote speaker on employee engagement Wayne Clarke. His Global Growth Institute has inspired and developed over 30,000 managers in over 30 countries. Hi Wayne.\nWayne Clarke: Hi Nigel. Thank you for having me.\nNC: With Zofia Bajorek she's a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies. She has a special interest in the role of line managers and best health and well being work practices. Hello.\nZofia Bajorek: Hi, really, really excited to take part in this podcast today. So thank you for letting me talk.\nNC: You're very welcome. And from the home team with us after a distinguished senior HR career in the public, private and third sectors, it's the CIPD's own People and Transformation Director, Amanda Arrowsmith. Hello.\nAmanda Arrowsmith: Hello everyone, pleased to be here.\nNC: Now, Wayne I'll start with you. I mean, everybody can surely see that today's line managers have a lot on their plate. I mean, they have to monitor those hybrid workers, mentor careers and well being, enforce policies get more work out of people. I mean, the cynic might say, \"Who'd be a manager now?\"\nWC: It's an insane thing to do. It's exactly what we say. Actually the funny thing is in some organisations people decide not to be managers. We've seen this in a few organisations because when you look at the benefits involved from stepping up from being an individual contributor or member of the team to being the team manager in some instances it is a sort of not such a smart thing to do. We've got a large organisation that we work with involved in the distribution business and many of the staff there have told us there is no way that they would step up to what they call a work area manager. If you look at the uplift in pay versus the stress involved, versus the fact that many of your colleagues will now see you as one of them, actually most employees will say it's not for me. The challenge then is they've got to try and attract people from other organisations to come in, but of course that involves its own challenges because you're getting people to step into quite hardened and long serving teams of people where forming those relationships in some cases takes years to be an effective team manager. So in answer to your question it is, it is a tough place to be.\nNC: Amanda Arrowsmith has this always been the case? I mean, we love to point to evidence on this podcast. I mean, do we know if the people management burden has swung, some would say a bit too far to the front line, from being handled by you know, HR professionals and the like?\nAA: Yeah, I'm not sure I would agree swung too far to the front line, but I'm sure we'll get to that. But yeah, I think it has changed. I think over the last 25 years we've seen significant changes and partly that's a lot to do with the change in the world of work. So, if you look at lots of different areas you used to have administration teams or personal assistants and secretaries, and we don't have those anymore. And with technology comes some changes in the way we do things. So as we've had less of that kind of, hierarchical organisation and moved to perhaps flatter structures, people managers responsibilities have increased as well. And I think we, as we move forward, individuals kind of want to work more as we become more dispersed. We'll talk, I'm sure we'll touch on hybrid today, and we'll touch on remote working teams and teams that work globally. But the old days of someone perhaps sitting in front of, I think if I think of an image I think about those typing pools and someone kind of sat on a little bit of a stage at the front looking down on rows of desks. Those have very much changed and people management has adapted with that.\nNC: And Zofia Bajorek, do we actually know that duff people management is the thing which is holding businesses or organisations back? I mean, is it the hidden cause of this notorious UK productivity gap that I think the famous Peter Jay was talking to me about, about 30 years ago, dare I say?\nZB: I think there now is a lot of evidence to suggest that bad management can be a cause of the productivity puzzle. I often refer to the work of (inaudible) Van Reenan here who with their economic modelling have really, really shown that actually with organisations that have bad managers the productivity is often much lower. That comes from also the Engage for Success report that came out over 10 years ago now showing that poor management can lead to poor engagement and poor employee voice. And most importantly now poor health and well being of direct reports as well. And going back to your first question you said to Wayne I think it's really important that actually in a lot of organisations, just because you have technical expertise, that's what promotes you into management positions and that doesn't necessarily mean you have people management skills. And when people say, \"Oh it's OK because they can learn those soft skills and those soft skills are quite easy to do,\" I actually find that really irksome because it seems that soft skills and communications is an easy thing to learn. And actually from what we've seen from managers it really, really isn't.\nNC: So Wayne Clarke, if that's the case how do we know if it's somebody who hasn't been trained or is unsuitable for the job is at fault or whether it's just the design of the job?\nWC: Well I think every single organisation is totally different and a lot of organisations believe that they can often retrofit other organisations' solutions on their organisational cultures. Even within organisations you've got multiple subcultures and sub teams and subcultures. And I think in every single organisation we've ever been into, we've now worked with about a thousand different organisations around the world, every single culture tells us and shows us that there is individual best practice that most of those organisations don't learn from very well. And our approach has often been to identify what best practice looks like in those organisations and help other people to learn from it. So I guess in answer to the question, when you look at what we sort of set as a benchmark of whether or not this person is going to be a good manager or not for the organisation, in a way it's kind of too late to consider that. There are very few organisations, based on what we've seen, that have become, as I would call it, consciously aware of the exact thing that they're looking for in order to drive their economic success. I'm an economist by training, and I sort of run into some of the challenges in the people teams, because my argument is that I think a lot of people teams don't really understand the economic engine of the organisation and therefore what actually we should be looking for and what's the essential role of the manager. So in many cases if you were to ask the question in June 2023, \"What's the job of the manager in your organisation?\" It's not probably what it's been before because everything's changed, but people don't think about it in a new paradigm. It's kind of, always as it was with some tweaks on it and some competencies built around it.\nNC: Well you've brought up a massive issue there, what are we actually looking for in a good people manager? Amanda Arrowsmith, where do we start? What other competencies, the behaviours that make a great people manager?\nAA: When we're looking for good people managers we're always looking for people, and Zofia touched on it before, we talk about people who get promoted because they're technical experts, and often we make them player managers because not only do they start managing people, but they're also still doing their job. So they're having to be technical experts, play and continue to contribute to a team and to productivity whilst also managing people. And so we're doing all of that to them. We're not necessarily looking at do they have the best communication skills? Can they undertake performance management? Are they really clear on setting out what good looks like and being able to help people and guide people to understand what good looks like? You might have someone who can really understand a production KPI but do they understand how to put a KPI into people performance and help people to drive those forward? Can they deal with conflict? Can they deal with difficult situations? We ask people who perhaps have come through an accountancy route all of a sudden to start talking to people about fertility issues, menopause, potentially the loss of a child, potentially the loss of a family member, a breakdown of a marriage, a house move, getting married, falling in love, moving around the world. And they do all these things as people managers on a day to day basis when actually they're really good at telling you what your balance sheet looks like and where that is, and we don't always equip them to do that.\nNC: OK, I want to go to Zofia on this and other things, but before we leave you, I mean, you hinted earlier that you wanted to defend the people profession, but as you went through that list I'm thinking a lot of those things, good people professionals would know quite a lot about. So how has this happened? I mean, we understand the reasons why these roles have moved to the front line where managers can really deal with their people but there must be so many times when they're lacking this expertise and it isn't available.\nAA: And sometimes that's the right time for a people professional to step in and to support and provide coaching to the manager or to support the individual. But also if you look at organisations, say you've got an organisation of 5,000 you might have 60, 70 HR people working in that organisation, but you've probably got 2,000 people managers, and they're on the front line and they're in the right place and that kind of immediacy and that need to do it in the right time means that the people professionals' role becomes much more about developing skills' providing toolkits' giving people coaching and mentoring and then being that subject matter expert perhaps when they're needed. I don't know Zofia, what do you think?\nZB: Well I think that I go back to what Cary Cooper sometimes says when he talks about line managers, in that 20% of people are excellent people managers and should stay as people managers. 60%, well they're in the, OK if we give them a bit of training and a bit of coaching then maybe we can push them up to that 20%, and then 20 % of people should not just go near people at all. And actually in a webinar I was with him, he's just like, \"Let's just cull them, let's just cull bad managers because bad managers are bad for health.\" And that sounds quite extreme, but actually I do think in all that rhetoric he's got a really good point. So what we need to do is in that top 20% we need to understand what that 20% has that helps them to excel at the people management aspect of the role and then hopefully with that 60%, with a bit of training maybe we can get them up to that 20% and then leave the other 20% just to do their technical job. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't get an opportunity for further promotion just because they are not line managing. Actually, it's OK not to line manage if you know that you're not going to be a good one. And actually it's probably beneficial for your organisation if you put your hand up to say, \"I don't want to manage because I'm not good at it.\"\nNC: Zofia, I kind of get that these people have probably been miscast, but that means they were recruited wrongly to those jobs. I mean, you survey the employment scene, how come these people have got these managers' jobs?\nZB: Because of the way that the organisations are structured, and that's the sad thing. We're living in an old formation of managers here, like I said previously you just get promoted into these positions. And I think that needs to change. We now need to actually look at, in more detail what competencies we want line managers to have. And we need to bound that role, we need to make clear the expectations that we want from line managers, because actually it's easier to say what line managers don't do rather than what they do do at the moment, because the role has just expanded massively. The bandwidth is continuously growing and the resources that managers have to deal with it all is completely reducing.\nNC: And in fact Wayne Clarke, those commercial pressures on managers are pretty intense, aren't they? And is there a case for saying that sometimes people managers may have a slightly hazy grasp of the commercial realities that are forcing them to make decisions maybe rather badly?\nWC: Yeah and also average managers too. I mean, we've just done, we've got 15,500 managers we've got data on and we've been looking at some really fascinating things. One thing we found, and bearing in mind I'm quite biased because I think these are pretty good managers, is that 47% of managers of the 15,500 that we looked at in our data don't understand the organisation's finances. So if you're the CEO looking at 100 managers you picked at random and 47 have said, \"No idea boss what the, what the sort of economic engine of the organisation is let alone people professionals,\" you know half the managers don't understand it because they're often not communicated to in the right way, they're not shared the right level of context. And I think one of the dangers of the, of the Mr Cooper's stats here, and I don't know if those are the right stats if we're misquoting him or not, so it wouldn't be fair, but it's all too easy to say, \"We've got a bunch of managers who are no good let's get rid of them.\" The truth is if we approach this with real empathy and look at what managers actually have to deal with I think in every individual case you'd reach a conclusion that there's probably some support that could help them, there's a mentorship that could work. I don't believe that there is a bunch of managers that you could routinely just get rid of in an organisation. I just don't see it.\nAA: I think that as organisations we get a little bit complacent with managers though. So it's a bit like your driving test. So you pass your driving test at 17, 18, 19 and you're still driving at 20, 30, 40, 50 and you don't have to take another driving test until you get to a certain age and until you perhaps, there's some arbitrary thing about your health failing because you've hit a certain age. And we kind of do that with managers. So we perhaps give them management training early on, or they go into a management role early on and then the development of those managers, it's almost like, \"Well you've been a manager once, you continue to be a manager and we allow you to be a manager,\" and it's the same with everything that we do in business, sometimes you have to recognize when something isn't working. And there are people who just genuinely are technical experts. They're just brilliant at what they do on a technical basis but being a manager, be that either a people manager or a business manager, might not be the right thing for them. I remember working in a law firm early in my career, and we had someone who worked for us who really should have been on the partnership track because he was technically excellent and he, law is very much that kind of time served place which I think you were alluding to earlier, if you've worked somewhere a certain amount of time maybe you should get promoted. And law used to be very much like that, you did so many years you got promoted and that was the route. But this chap should never be allowed near a business, managing a business, but also never be allowed near managing a team because it just wasn't his skillset, it wasn't where he was adding value, but he still had a value in the business. So not all people through their career and through promotion, I guess, will get to be managers.\nZB: Well I think there's also the ability, motivation, opportunity model when it comes to management. So 1) does somebody have the ability to do the job? So here we're talking about the competencies, whether that be technical or people management competencies, then has somebody actually got the motivation to do the role? Because you can, we're at risk of falling into this training gap that we can train somebody and train somebody and train somebody, but if they're not motivated they're not going to do it. And then are we giving people the opportunity to do it? And that goes back to the original question is, \"Have we overburdened them and are we giving them the right resources to do?\" So once again we can train them and train them and train them but if they don't have the HR support, if they don't have the learning and development support then they're not going to have the opportunity to do that job well. So using that model is actually quite a neat triangulisation of the three things that we want our people managers, line managers technical managers to have.\nNC: Yeah, I absolutely see that. And moving on from that, Wayne, I just sort of picked up a random list here of traits of managers who aren't very effective, not giving people feedback or recognition, not supporting their learning and development requirements, not listening to people's concerns, not defining people's responsibility, never asking for feedback about their own performance. I mean, we could go on forever and think about managers we've worked for or whatever and their shortcomings. Can you give us some practical ideas now? What are the most reliable actions you can initiate within your organisation to assess your managers' abilities and then perhaps help them and re engineer the role so you improve the overall performance?\nWC: But if you look at, I guess, you know, most of the management models that people still think are active and are useful were based on the fact that we were in fields or in factories producing widgets per hour. So the knowledge worker is a very different sort of kettle of fish when it comes to getting people to be productive. I think one of the most effective mechanisms or methods, or things you can do, is having a really good regular quality one to one with your team. It's probably the biggest thing that we would focus on. The reason being is I spent five years involved with looking at data as part of The Sunday Times process. After I left corporate I was in professional service firms for about 11, 12 years and one of the lowest scoring questions that we looked at in every organisation we came across, which is the question which says, \"I've got skills that the organisation could use but doesn't.\" Which is quite strange because in June 2023 where lots of people are saying they're overworked, overwhelmed, underpaid, stressed out on one hand, on the other hand they're saying, \"I'm massively underutilised.\" So, you know, the good quality regular one to one, whether organisations have got tons of money to spend on L&D or whether we've seen charities that have got zero budgets, nothing at all to spend on L&D, doesn't matter. A good quality regular one to one with a line manager seems to make a massive impact. The skills that you need for that of course are things like you know, empathy really helps, having an interest in people really helps. And then on the other side of it you need an individual who is actively caring about their own growth and development, you know, I lecture at a couple of universities and one of the things I try and get across to undergrads and postgrads is this really important point that nobody, maybe your mum or dad if you're lucky, cares more about your growth and development than you do or should do. You know, the idea that, you know, you're going to work for an organisation which has got a deep level of care for your growth and your future. If you drop lucky into an organisation at the right point in time consider yourself lucky. But in a way there's no universal right or human right that an organisation is going to care about your growth and development. So requires like a bit of a deal right, a bit of a contract. On one hand you've got someone who cares about developing themselves and wants to invest time and energy to do so and on the other hand you've got a caring, listening, empathic manager who cares about connecting you to opportunities that might exist in the organisation to grow and develop you.\nNC: Yeah, now you talk about a caring and empathetic manager there. I totally get that thing about getting people to have these regular conversations. But Amanda, emotional intelligence is not easy, you can have a conversation with somebody, but if you're not very good at all that side of things you may still miss the things they don't say, the things that they really mean. You have to interpret almost what's unsaid as much as what is said. So my point really is, can you teach that?\nAA: Well, I think that just before I get into can you teach it, and that's even harder when you're dealing on screen, and you're dealing in 2D. Because at least when you were in person with someone you could kind of get that sixth sense bit, that kind of someone might be feeling a bit down and it's, so it's, there's an added layer of that now. Can you teach it? Can you learn it? Yes and no. So, I believe that you can develop skills and tools and things that work for you that help you to navigate that very human interaction. And that's kind of where some of the role of the people professional comes in, in supporting the line manager, working in partnership with the line manager to perhaps prepare them for those conversations, giving them tools, giving them systems and processes that work for them, but also helping them with those skills, teaching them communication skills. You know, Wayne talked earlier about the people that he's worked with and developed, and you can see that and you can teach them. There are going to be people perhaps who they're always going to find it a bit difficult and they're always going to find it a bit awkward and that for me is where your people professional, your HR professional, your L&D manager, support has to step up and recognise that they can't do a one size fits all training for managers and we need to recognise that we're, it has to be personalised sometimes and you are going to have to work with different people individually.\nZB: I think it was fascinating that Amanda brought in the whole hybrid nature of this now and emotional intelligence in the hybrid world. And we've seen that throughout the pandemic really where I see we've had accidental heroes and accidental villains when we're talking about line managers. So we've got the people who just somehow navigated through this messy world of work of change that Covid just threw at us, and they understood actually that whether somebody was working in a hybrid world or there were key workers on the front line they just needed that support. They needed that check in, they needed that, \"How are you doing?\" And were able to do it. And then you had the accidental villains who just thought, \"I can just carry on in the line management and how I was doing it before,\" and that just hasn't worked, because it's different. The world of work has changed, the Covid pandemic has affected everybody individually and if a line manager didn't recognise that then that's where we have the issue. You know, we had people who joined the pandemic or in the hybrid world now have extra caring responsibilities, may have been affected, may have had a bereavement, may have had their mental health affected or their well being affected by the whole change and transition. And if line managers haven't got that then they have become an accidental villain if they haven't changed their practice towards how they manage people.\nNC: I like the idea of an accidental villain, but we have accidental heroes as well Wayne, and I guess we just want to make more of them?\nWC: We do, I'm actually meeting one later on this afternoon for a bit of a surprise for him. So by the time the podcast goes out I won't be spoiling the surprise. But his name is Jonathan Raggett and he is the CEO of Red Carnation Hotels. Red Carnation sort of popped into my consciousness a number of years ago because they achieved the number two position on The Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For, which is really tough. If you understand anything about the list and also as a hotelier with an average salary of 20 odd thousand versus a sort of, you know, corporate bank average salary of about 300,000 and they beat some of those big corporate banks on the engagement score. They've got about 3,000 staff in 20 hotels across six, seven countries. What we've learned is that they are exceptional, and the two things if I could boil it down that they get right so well, one is the selection process, they've become consciously aware of exactly what they're looking for in their organisation, which is unlike many organisations, and the second thing is if you look into the mechanics of how it works, and it sounds so simple, but it gets done, which is the big difference. Every 12 weeks every person in the organisation, and we're talking across 20 hotels in 6 countries is having a conversation with their line manager which essentially revolves around two really important questions based on, \"How are you feeling, how are you doing?\" And what happens is that entire organisation every three months has a cathartic exercise of getting stuff off their chest, and it might not be as a manager that I can pay your gas bill for you this month because I know you can't afford that. People have got all sorts of fears and concerns, but it can be that I can listen and have you feel like you are cared for, and that's the important element of it. Now if for example you've just fuelled up your jet and flown in from LA and you've chosen to stay at the best hotel in London on Tripadvisor as guests would do such a thing, really important to every single aspect of your guest experience is going to be that every, at every point, every touch point you feel like someone really cares about your experience. So the key thing that they're looking for in the interview process, they're looking for, \"Do you, have you ever created a memorable experience for someone?\" You know, if you're asking someone that question and they're drawing a blank then probably it's not the right type of person for that type of service delivery which you could bring back to looking at the manager selection process. You know, what have we learned about the organisation that tells us what the key role in the job of the manager is? If we suspect we've got two candidates who are both technically as competent but one's more towards that type of behavior, that person should be selected all day long, but they're not because often we don't really understand what we're looking for and the structure of the organisation dictates that it's quite odd that we've got to put people into management positions at certain pay rates.\nZB: So IAS have done some research recently, especially over the pandemic about what direct reports want from their managers. And I think going back to your question about, \"How can organisations choose good managers?\" Listen to your people, right? That's going to be the best one. There's that adage of, join an organisation, leave a manager, look at your HR analytics, see what's going on. If there's spots in your organisation where there's clear retention issues let's have a focus then on that. Why is that happening? But our research is saying, so we asked direct reports what do you want from your managers? Technical expertise wasn't there at all. What they wanted was somebody who listened to them who gave them voice and looked after their well being. That's what the top three things were. Would really suggest to your organisations, we collect HR data for a reason, let's use it. Use your data that you have to understand what's going on in your organisation and then you can be able to change it.\nNC: Well Amanda Arrowsmith's nodding there. As we sort of try and bring this to some kind of conclusion, Amanda a few kind of ideas maybe for how you do forge these better partnerships, a better support network between people managers and the people professionals?\nAA: I believe as the people profession we have to stop trying to force a process and system on managers that takes the human out of it. We have to remember human. I was really pleased to hear Wayne say something about that, those two questions, so the, \"How are you doing?\" I wrote a blog many years ago which is part of a book of blogs called This Time It's Personnel which was, you can get on Kindle and download, it's from lots of different HR practitioners. The reason I was smiling was I literally said, \"You just asked five questions. How are you doing? What's going well? What can I or we as the company do more of or better? What can you do or differently, or what can you help to do differently?\" But also, \"What's next for you?\" So I think as people professionals let's support managers, recognising they're individuals and they have individual needs. Let's give them the tools and processes and systems that work for them but let's not over engineer it and make it something that takes the human out of what they're doing.\nNC: And finally Amanda, I mean, people professionals are under a lot of pressure, they've got a lot of other new duties, are they going to have to in the end reclaim some of these jobs that once the people manager is established someone needs something they're going to have to put them back to the people professional?\nAA: I hope not, but I think that, and I don't want to start getting into it, but I think if we look at what's coming down the AI route and how much of that process and system comes, if we embrace AI as a people profession that could probably take some of that process system admin stuff out for managers and actually allow managers to deal with the stuff that makes a difference and be human.\nZB: I'd like to add two points to that. I think sometimes the people management and the personnel management system can place the line manager in a really, really difficult position here. And we normally say as they can either become an advocate for a policy or an apologist for a policy they're in a position where they might have to say, \"Well we're doing this because this is what the policy says. Where actually what they want to say is, \"I'm really, really, really, really sorry that we're having to do it this way. I wouldn't have done it this way, but this is what the policy is telling me to do.\" And I think that position there is what line managers find very, very difficult because they're torn both ways. I think the other thing that we really haven't discussed today, but I think is really, really important is the well being of the line manager themselves, because we know that especially over the pandemic, line managers who have done the more, \"How are you doing? How are you doing? How are you, looking well? Are you looking after yourself?\" They were experiencing more stress and reduced well being themselves. So the greater the span of their control that they're having, the worse impact it's having on their own well being. And that's where I think the people profession can really come in and support the line manager with their own well being. It's not a massively discussed issue. It's a really hidden issue but one that really, really does need to be shouted about going forward.\nNC: It's been brilliant to hear from you all. Thanks very much. Wayne Clarke from the Global Growth Institute, Amanda Arrowsmith here at the CIPD and Zofia Bajorek from the Institute for Employment Studies. There's resources on all aspects of people management on the CIPD website. What have I learned? Well, simply why recruiting or promoting the right managers, training them and supporting them now has to be a number one priority as we've heard in this post Covid, hybrid age of working. And I was also struck by something Wayne said there, about people professionals would do well to get a better understanding of the hard business, how their organisation makes money, what its priorities are, so as to grasp the detail of what managers have on their plate. Quite a response to last month's Learning and Development edition on springing surprises in training. It was a good consensus that it's managing to make an emotional connection with your participants that is half the battle. So do have a listen to that podcast if you haven't and check out all our recent back catalogue. Next time getting to grips with the human element of cyber security, after all it is not just for the IT department. Until then from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us at CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

For many, a perception exists that traditional approaches to organisation training have become stale. It’s imperative for learning professionals to remain curious and open minded towards new techniques and methods, in order to get the best from their programmes. \nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Andy Hoang, Founder of Beyond Blocks; Rita Isaac, Learning Coordinator at CIPD; and David Hayden, Learning Content Manager at CIPD, as we discuss how L&D professionals can incorporate the element of surprise and tap into human emotions to help people learn more effectively.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 28:48\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: This month, tales of the unexpected.\n'Surprise!'\nNC: Yes, how springing surprises can help more of your learning sink in.\nNC: Now, I was reading a crime novel on holiday last week and I was stunned by a clever plot twist that I really didn't see coming. All my preconceptions about what might happen next were right out of the window. Surprise is a powerful emotion, it stops you in your tracks and gets you thinking and training, learning and development really ought to do that more often too. So this month we're all about how to fire up those synapses by ditching the predictable and the formulaic. Get ready to be surprised by three guests full of ideas on harnessing the power of the unexpected. It's time to ambush your people with memorable training, that can help knowledge to stick and creativity to flourish. With us, Rita Isaac, an author and artist with an academic background in painting and art history, but also with a decade of customer service and visitor experience in the commercial and museum world and she's now CIPD's Learning and Development Coordinator. Hello.\nRita Isaac: Hi.\nNC: You could have done us a picture, but a bit wasted on a podcast maybe. Next we've a learning technologies specialist, who helps teams nail their design creativity and builds simulations using, wait for it, Lego bricks. He's Andy Hoang.\nAndy Hoang: Hi Nigel.\nNC: Can you really build an MRI scanner out of Lego?\nAH: Most definitely.\nNC: And it's the return of CIPD Learning Content Manager and Author, David Hayden. Hi David.\nDavid Hayden: Hi, Nigel, hi, everyone.\nNC: For whom every day is a learning day. I nicked that phrase from you, David.\nDH: It certainly is, it certainly is.\nNC: So set the scene, David, if you would. Learning's evolved rapidly, hasn't it? Especially through the pandemic. But it is often formulaic and predictable and I know that you say part of the answer is, you've just got to get people doing things within minutes, you've got to spring surprises.\nDH: Yeah, so if you think about a traditional training approach, whether it be online or whether it be face to face, it starts with the same approach, hello, tell us who you are, tell us what you do, tell us your role, maybe if you're lucky, you get to say, tell us what you're expecting from this course. Or if you're doing something online, it's just so anonymous, and it's a wave of predictability when we go on any kind of learning intervention, we know what the setup is going to be. So if we can do something right from the off that's a little bit different, whether we're opening a webinar with people saying, what colour socks have you got on? To opening a face to face event where we're getting people up drawing things, then that stimulates that bit of surprise, oh, this is different, and maybe we'll talk about, a little bit later, about what's going on in the brain when that happens.\nNC: Absolutely. Rita, it is sad, isn't it, that in many organisations the chance to learn something new, or take part in a training course, is met with such a groan? Why do you think that the unexpected, disarming people, as we've been hearing from David, is the way forward?\nRI: I think that we do it on a daily basis, we might just not realize it and I think that we need to harness it further. We need to weaponise the element of surprise almost. Although I do not have, I don't think I share the same grim vision of webinars and online sessions. For example, we just had two suppliers delivering their engaging sessions during Learning at Work Week, one of them surprised everyone by starting just saying, I have no presentations, no slides, here is me and it was one of the most engaging sessions we've had in a long time. We've had people going out of their way to send emails, messages, everything. And another one that his presentation was mainly photos of him growing up and linking that to ally ship and inclusion and diversity training. So I think that there are people already doing it, I think that we can do it better. I agree that the element of surprise is really important, because we know that it involves some emotional connection and if we are emotionally engaged, we know that, that is powerful in terms of retaining memories, attention, focus, all of that. So I think that we can definitely do it better, I think we can plan spontaneity, I think we can definitely design for surprise.\nNC: It sounds to me, Andy, as if this could be a lot to do with the trainer. If some people can actually produce surprise and the unexpected without doing anything fancy, that's fine, but maybe some people don't have the personality to pull it off.\nAH: I think surprise is actually, it's surprising for the recipients, but not often surprising for the person who's delivering the surprise. So I don't think that you have to be, it's not something you're born, that you have to be born with, but you can plan a surprise into your workshop. Going back to the question that you asked Rita, I often hear it said that learning happens outside your comfort zone and I do think that when we go in and we say, right, we're going to teach you something, you're going to have to learn something today, we are asking people to be uncomfortable because that's where learning happens. If you were comfortable all your life, then you probably wouldn't, you probably wouldn't learn a lot I feel.\nNC: Has it got to be fun Andy? Because I know you said to me when we were chatting before that some people can't make things fun.\nAH: That's a great question. I don't think it necessarily has to be fun, but I do think that with the topic that you've mentioned today, if we're centering it on surprise, we talk about the element of surprise and I think that the element of surprise is only an element, it's one small part that makes up good training. We need to take that element of surprise and say, now that I've surprised you, I've got some real substance to back this up. Whether that be fun or not, well actually I feel that fun comes from having expanded your brain. When you've learnt something, you get that sense of reward and I don't necessarily feel it has to be fun per se, but learning has to be rewarding in some way and often I think that because it's often so predictable, we can easily switch off and say, I know what to expect, so I won't be uncomfortable, so I'm going to switch off. And so a little element of surprise can throw that whole circuit out of whack and get people to take things in.\nNC: Do we actually know, David, whether organisations often get as far as evaluating, whether it is the lack of creativity, surprise, the unexpected in the delivery, that's to blame for disappointing learning outcomes?\nDH: Yeah, so we know from our research, we've got a piece of research coming out in a few weeks' time from the CIPD, about the challenge of evaluating and measuring impact that a lot of organisations have. It is that, are we linking the right things in the first place, before we even create a learning programme, to be able to measure them afterwards? So there's a whole piece of work to do around that. But I just want to come back to the question that you asked Andy about fun and absolutely, there are some programmes where you can't necessarily start with, hey, we're going to have fun on this course today, because of the topic. But you can, as Andy said, create an environment where people are engaged and people are drawn in and when they're at the end of it, say, do you know what? That was a difficult subject, but I had a good time because of A, B and C. That's not the same as having fun, but they had a good time and absolutely out the comfort zone and learnt something.\nNC: And before we leave you here, David, what about the learning theory? Without going too much into the deep sort of psychology of it all, why does surprise work?\nDH: On a very basic level, when we are out of our comfort zone, when we do something different, our brains are heightened to protect us. So it all goes back to that ancient part of the brain and the fight, flight, freeze and form element and all our senses are heightened when something different happens. So that's when we're at our most attuned and looking out for what's happening all around us. So, yeah, it absolutely ties into that from a neuroscience point of view and links in with other elements of learning theory that link to the humanistic approach to learning, relating to people on a human level, looking for allies within the learning environment, that kind of thing. So, yeah, there's a few things what stem from that.\nNC: So Rita, we've shocked people a bit at the beginning, we've got them out of a comfort zone Where do you take it with people next, what has the training got to do if you're going to take advantage of this initial kind of flurry of interest?\nRI: I think that when planning any learning intervention or when developing, we need to factor those moments in. So create times in the same way that we would want diversity of media, you want to have some videos, you want to have activities, breakout rooms, whatever it is, in the same way we can plan for that surprise, or fun, or shock and that can be either with the content, or the way you're delivering it, or obviously you can add both. When I say this, I mean content, things like examples, facts, shocking statistics, any grim facts that are connected, people will retain those and you will basically whip them in, into the conversation and in terms of the how and how you can create those points, basically using things that we already know about, but trying to look at it from a different perspective. So things like gamification, challenges, hands on experiences, yes, action learning, but make it clear what's in it for them, get them to bring real life examples. Obviously, if it's in house training or learning that you are developing, do your research, make sure that you understand how people can leave with a toolkit, give them something to action, because that's also going to retain that attention and that element of surprise throughout. They might be even surprised by how useful it is, or how engaging it is. Storytelling, such a powerful thing and at the moment it's basically a buzzword, everyone is talking about this, but once again, why do we do it? Why is it so important? How can we make it better? Instead of doing it yourself, you might want to get people from the organisation to tell the stories. I was using this example the other day, some companies are using sitcoms to deliver their compliance training, because it taps into the whole binging series and getting into a storytelling mode almost.\nNC: When you say sitcoms, you mean that they're getting people to act them out, or they're watching sitcoms and then analysing them in some way?\nRI: They're getting people to act out scripts of compliance, so GDPR, cybersecurity, things like that. I do appreciate that not everyone has a budget to go out and hire actors, my point is not that, my point is maybe instead of just having a dry presentation or a script, you can have your data governance team recording nice videos with interesting facts. Maybe you can even get some of them role playing, or IT role playing cybersecurity situations. So there is this element of storytelling that you can tap into by engaging the learners themselves in a way and the people that they know, to explore that emotional connection and further engage them into surprise.\nNC: Well some people may have seen, there's a recent example of this isn't there, this reminds me, the Meta company has, their legal department has created a Netflix style training series with reoccurring characters, involving shadowy hackers and gaming convention, essentially to get compliance staff to learn how to perform tasks better. So they stop the action and then talk about what they might do. I can imagine though this role playing stuff does, it's not for everybody, is it? Some people find role playing very, very difficult. Let's get back to that in a minute, because I want to bring Andy in to just sort of think about doing it a different way. So you go into the training room and there is a large pile of plastic Lego bricks. So broadly, how do you find this works in training? In other words it's, people are learning more than just how to make the model itself.\nAH: Yes, I find it's really interesting the reaction that adults have to walking in to see a pile of Lego bricks on a table. I believe it raises their inquisitiveness. OK, what's going to happen here? How am I going to make sure I don't make a fool of myself? And so, when you go into a new situation like this, with a table full of Lego bricks, you need to make sure that all of the participants in the room feel safe, they're ready to use this heightened inquisitiveness, this heightened alertness, to actually go and benefit their learning.\nNC: Because of course, because some people are dexterous, some people aren't, some people can build brilliant things with their kids with Lego, others, you just build the same house or swimming pool or something every time. So there is a, quite a wide variation, but I was amazed to see that you could even get people to tackle how they would deal with an HR issue using the Lego.\nAH: A few years ago I developed, what I fondly remember and call, the Lego HR game and with the Lego HR game we built a model of a startup and the startup was a little hat factory, and the idea was that with a limited amount of money every year, so in every round you would have about PS10,000 to spend and you had to decide on certain things that you could buy. So it would be different policies or procedures that you might want to put in place in your new startup business. Obviously because we put in the sort of budgetary constraints you are only allowed to buy a certain number of items, buying those things, let's say you bought diversity and inclusion training for example, but you didn't buy health and safety, then in the first round a member staff might chop their finger off for example and you'd have all the attendant consequences. So when the participants would come into the room and see a load of Lego on the table and it was built like a factory, with little minifigs and conveyor belts and stuff, yeah, the first thing they thought was, what on earth is going on here and the next was, all right, how do I win this?\nNC: So kind of taking it on from this, David, what could you say about how you ensure that the game doesn't become the thing, that everything you're doing arcs back to what you're trying to achieve with your learning and development?\nDH: Yeah, and the key what Andy said there was around well planned activities, so not just something thrown in, so the well planned element includes a number of a number of things. So the well planned is, is there a link to people's reality within the game? In this case, the Lego building. Is there a good level of debrief around making those connections, If not, people can't immediately see those connections, is there a good debrief from the activity to people's reality? And then is there a call for arms around, what are people going to do as a result of that activity? So that honing in on that well planned. One of the common phrases in learning and development is, steal with pride and I would change that to, steal with purpose. So we may see an activity happening in someone else's domain, but we can't always lift and shift that and put it in our domain, because our context is slightly different. And that's one of the reasons why a number of people have a reaction to things like icebreakers, because the icebreaker at the start of a learning session may have nothing to do with the content and people's reality, it's just something that the trainer's seen work somewhere else and thought, oh, that's a good game, I'll steal that and use it. So it's steal with purpose and context.\nNC: And Rita, we mentioned the role playing and people's reaction to that, the slightly simpler one that you touched on before is storytelling. Can you just talk a little bit more about how you get people to open up in that kind of way?\nRI: Of course. Can I just say, in regards to the role play, it doesn't always have to be the traditional cringe feeling role play. As David just said, if you do it with purpose, you will pluck real life activities and you will get people, almost like a learning community, action learning, you will get them to work out through simulations basically, activities that will allow them to experiment, make decisions and even assess possible consequences of their actions, in a safe, controlled environment. So this is role playing in a way.\nNC: OK.\nRI: In regards to storytelling, I think that there is an element of it that if you are asking people, attendees to share their stories within the session, that there has to be embracing that vulnerability and there has to be a psychological safety that is considered also while planning. So, if I'm doing this in person, where is it going to be, how can we guarantee that this is felt? Who is attending, is it everyone from the same team, do we have people from different teams? What kind of training is this? All of this comes into play when planning. If we are doing it in an online environment, things like ensuring that you don't record it, there are no transcripts, you can take outcomes from the sessions, but you do try and create that sense of comfort. But a good part of storytelling does come from this comfort, I think it's just a matter of, for the facilitator and I think that this is also the key here. We're thinking of how to include surprising training, but actually learning has evolved from training, we are not trainers, we are learning facilitators, so we've moved away from that, so we just need to create an environment and plan an environment where people can learn from each other as well and surprise each other. And I think that for that, we can make ourselves vulnerable first by sharing experiences, making ourselves and our experiences relatable to, showing that we're not just talking from a completely unfamiliar place. There is some power to that.\nNC: What do you think about that Andy? I know you wanted to come in earlier on, something David said struck a chord with you.\nAH: Yeah, actually, both your speakers have struck a chord with me there. So Rita talked about psychological safety and David talked about purpose. And for me, I've seen so many really poor surprises where, just in the middle of a training session you'll get a surprise, you'll get to the end, you go, that was a bit weird, that was a bit icky, and I don't really understand what that was for. So if a surprise is delivered and there's some purpose, the key here is that reflection piece. I think what happens is when you've got a session that you think is quite predictable, suddenly you've got this surprise, you're now in the hands of your trainer, because your trainer's thrown in this thing that's a bit uncomfortable, so in my case, it'll be Lego, I've thrown in Lego, I've said, right, we're going to build with this. Now for the next half an hour, I'm going to make you a little bit uncomfortable, but the purpose of making you uncomfortable is to get you to learn something and by the end of it, you'll pop out the other side and during that time, you will be psychologically safe, I'll make sure you have all the skills you need to build with the Lego. So you don't have to build a Bugatti, or the most amazing Lego piece, because the purpose of our building is to learn something, so whatever you build is acceptable within the parameters of this room. Then when we get to the end of the session, when we reflect on that and we say, look at how we've connected the Lego model that you've built to the purpose that you came in here for, there is this overwhelming sense of relief.\nNC: And of course that works, because clearly when it comes to the Lego you're really good at doing that, but David Hayden Not all training facilitators have this creative streak, Rita has it too with her art and with other things that she does, so how do you make all the magic happen, if you're much more comfortable just with your old interactive training videos and your lecture notes?\nDH: Yeah, so there is an opportunity for a number of us in the profession to really role model how we've developed in that space. So to shout out about it and there are people regularly online on LinkedIn, on Twitter and other platforms, talk about their own journey for learning to be a better facilitator. And it may be around people recognising themselves that they're going through the same routine, opening a PowerPoint and typing in some slides without necessarily making connections around the topic. So I'd encourage people to take a step back, if they're in a design phase, we talked on a previous podcast around design and taking that purposeful pause to think around what it is they're designing and what links they can make. But also, if we think about, not just in the delivery element, but in making links with evaluation and the learning needs analysis in the first place, where can we maximise that element of surprise as we go through the whole training cycle?\nRI: In regards to what David was saying, obviously, if you are in stages of planning, yes, plan, prepare, try to gather as many tools as you can to have those elements of surprise throughout the training. But also, I would say leverage who you have, not just what you have. So guest speakers, guest experts, not everyone charges to come and speak and share their expertise and even if you don't have the budget, or you don't have anyone that is relevant to the matter, once again, talk to people across departments, get your in house experts to come and give a little bit of a storytelling moment. So that's one way of overcoming that facilitation challenge, if you don't feel so confident about, or so creative about it. In terms of overall challenges, I think that a big one for this is still the evaluation point. We all know how important informal learning is and I think that the element of surprise comes with that as well, the natural, the organic, spontaneous, but we also know how difficult informal learning is to measure and I think that, that, it's almost, we need to surprise ourselves almost in that sense. We need to look at outside of the box as well, to see how can we actually measure those things or make the intangible more tangible? Are we talking to all of the stakeholders in the business that can help measure behaviour impact? Can data analysis or data governance team actually give us some ideas on how to collect data from existing points? Can we use AI to measure satisfaction and change in sentiment and satisfaction at work after learning interventions? So can we get creative? Can we surprise ourselves with planning? And this evaluation needs to be planned as well, as David was saying, it has to be set and contracted from the beginning and I think that that's something that we need to be better at as well.\nDH: I like that. So I say a lot around, use what you've got, but you saying there, use who you've got as well, is a good addition. So that's my learning bit for today, thank you, yeah.\nAH: What I was going to reflect on there actually is, you've got two people who on the surface of it look really, really creative, a Lego person, an artist, if you're looking at the sleeve notes of this particular episode you're going to say, I couldn't do that, couldn't be creative, couldn't surprise people, but I actually think that surprise doesn't come in your personality. I have a load of students I see every week who I come in and they say, what have you got for us this week? They know I've got a Lego box, because they come to Lego class, right? So if I don't have a surprise for them, then I'm, I've got it coming, right? But what actually this whole thing is about for me, is that a surprise is about knowing your audience. If you don't know your audience, you ain't going to be able to surprise them and then the end result of a surprise is either delight or disgust, you either say, yeah, that was an amazing thing that you did, we made a, we redesigned our entire business process, or you get to the end and go, why did you do that to me? You made me feel really uncomfortable and then you came away delivering nothing. And so that's kind of key, is that I think knowing your audience is the difference between surprising them and delighting them, or surprising them and disgusting them.\nNC: So, Rita, what is really all this about, in using these surprises, what are we trying to create and achieve here?\nRI: I think that, as David mentioned before, it's tapping into that natural mechanism of retaining more information and engaging with the information that comes with the element of surprise and surprise, shock, any of that really. But also, and I think that this is the part of connection, that we make emotional connections with facts and with information, but also with people. So, for me, using that and using those connections between people and what they know and what they can share, is a way to ensure that they also have an opportunity to surprise others. And sometimes we see that happening in a session, we see how much someone shares and I'm thinking of virtual learning, for example, in online sessions that we have, someone shares something on the chat while we are delivering content and all of a sudden you have ten, 15, 20 people adding to it and sharing links and plugging more information. And that there in itself, it's surprising for the facilitator, for the attendees, but also, that is learning in action, that is happening and that comes from connections, connecting points, connecting the dots, connecting solutions, connecting people, it all comes from that.\nNC: Well that's a positive spin on online and remote learning, which we might have tended to think is a bit of a second class option. David, I know you're obviously very keen on getting people together in a room, but you have to acknowledge that, as Rita says, it can work very well online.\nDH: Absolutely can work and yes and whilst I can love all the things you can do in a room with people and make use of that space, I absolutely can make use of the space online, even if you've only got the chat facility enabled, you can do some amazing things in that and getting people, firstly surprised and then engage with the reason for that surprise and the outcomes for it. So, no, absolutely, use the tools you've got, use what you've got and as Rita said, use who you've got.\nNC: Well I think you've all made the case very well for learning professionals to be more open minded and creative, to devise programs that have this one particular thing in common, that they incorporate an element of surprise. I think we've learnt it's all about disarming people, instilling a sense of wonder and a spirit of inquiry and as David said at the beginning, it needs to be right from the get go when you work with people. Now I should say there's a learning methods fact sheet and some other resources on the CIPD website to get you started on some of this. But we'd like to thank Andy Hoang of Beyond Blocks, Rita Isaac and David Hayden from CIPD. Until next time, from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us here, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "While artificial intelligence (AI) itself is not new – many organisations, knowingly or not, already use forms of AI technology within their businesses – we are now at the cusp of a major change. So just as the internet of things changed the way we work, connect, shop, spend our leisure time – and in turn how businesses operate – the AI revolution is set to usher in massive change affecting job design, workforce planning and organisational development. But is your organisation ready?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests: Katie Obi, Chief People Officer at Beamery, Kendra Briken, Sociologist and Senior Lecturer at University of Strathclyde, and Francis Lake, Founder at Green Juniper Limited, as we discuss how you can rewire your organisation to seize the initiative and not get caught on the backfoot.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 38:00\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Artificial intelligence is changing how we work. So how can you best adapt to reap the benefits and what are the risks. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNC: Until now HR really only had humans to worry about - the clue was in the name Human Resources. But suddenly AI is everywhere. Open access to tools like Chat GPT3 and 4 have opened the floodgates. Like it or not the workplace machines are coming. In fact, we thought we'd tried some text to speech AI ourselves.\nAI: Hi Nigel, hi everyone. My name is Emma. I think you'll find computer models like me are already saving organisations precious time and resources. For instance, I'm really good at screening the best job candidates. I can revolutionise your staff analytics, your training, or development. Or maybe I could host the rest of this podcast for you.\nNC: No thanks. I actually like my job, but can you explain what it is you actually do in simple terms?\nAI: That's easy. My strength lies in automating processes that previously needed a lot of brainpower, time, and effort. I can comb your enter database or indeed the whole of the world wide web. I then analyse the text or data and mimic the problem solving and decision-making capabilities of you humans. I have access to more knowledge than any human has ever known - that should free you up to do other tasks but please note I have no consciousness, well, not yet.\nNC: Now what we just heard there was pretty basis AI synthesised speech from text but today we want to focus way beyond that to discover what the arrival of large language models - GPT3 and 4 and other AI capabilities mean for your organisation. I mean just how do you work out where AI might speed your business. How do you rewire or redesign things to get the productivity benefits and understand the impact on the work experience itself. Joining us firstly the Chief People Officer of the Talent Management Organisation, Beamery, in all her HR roles she has focused on harvesting technology and data science to make the experience of work better. It's Katie Obi.\nKatie Obi: Hi, Nigel. Thanks so much for having me.\nNC: With a sociologist with a deep professional interest in the impact of automations - she's a senior lecturer at the University of Strathclyde Doctor Kendra Briken. Hello.\nKendra Briken: Hi, Nigel. Good to be here.\nNC: And we welcome the CIPD Chartered Fellow who recently took the organisational development lead shifting the culture at CYBG which is the Virgin Money Group. He's big on purpose and values. It's the founder of the Green Juniper Consultancy Francis Lake. Hello.\nFrancis Lake: Hi, Nigel. Good to be here.\nNC: So, Francis Lake, I mean we all have sense I think that something has changed recently - we've brought AI to a kind of tipping point.\nFL: I think the big thing that's really changing, at the moment, is that AI is suddenly in everybody's hands. And so, you're seeing you know thousands and thousands and thousands of experiments on an individual level. I then think there is another thing that is sort of right on the cusp, which is ChatGPT being built into Bing also into Microsoft Co-pilot and I'm particularly excited about the prospect of being able to use AI to produce my PowerPoint presentations probably ten times more quickly than I've been able to in the past.\nNC: So, it's like we're all getting a taste of it -\nFL: Exactly, yeah.\nNC: It's also power - it's no longer just decoding people - the IT department that are having all the fun with it. Erm - come back to you in a minute. Francis. Katie Obi, can you remind us I mean what kind of business areas is AI in most use already and maybe can you give us a few examples of the newer kind of applications that your clients are going for?\nKO: Yes, so I think AI has been around for a while in various different formats as well and I think one of the areas that has really embraced it fairly recently is really around data science as well and being able to get insights into the vast amounts of data and information that we have in organisations now. But I think as Francis was saying one of the big changes recently is getting AI into the hands of everyone and the difference that that makes as well in terms of the functionality like GPT4 to be able to take that to the next level. So we're starting to see AI and language models come into all sorts of enterprise applications with really interesting search functionality to be able to bring out more insights interpret what's in the data there and really help us to move that golden, that golden transition that we've all wanted as organisations to move from being to collect and report on the data to actually be able to make different decisions and drive actions and be much more prescriptive about how we use that. We are seeing a lot of different changes as Francis mentioned in terms of productivity as well. So, our ability to be able to be infinitely more produce than we were even a year ago with some of these technologies - whether it's creating our PowerPoints - whether it's creating our eLearning. Whether it is being able to understand more about skills data and what's going on both in our organisations and in the wider world.\nNC: Kendra Briken, it is pretty scary I mean we've got the whole of the world's knowledge at our fingertips. But you were telling me before this podcast the people in organisations do seem to have a bit of a basic confusion or a lack of knowledge about AI capabilities.\nKB: Yeah, thanks, Nigel. I think the interesting thing is already in the framing - you know the floodgates open, and we talk a lot about we but who is actually we? And Francis you made this point it's now far more accessible than before. But also, it is still channelled through companies and big monopolies like Google and Microsoft. We will see what will happen with Apple and Amazon and I think that's interesting part, isn't it? Because we could say that, oh, with search engines we already had this. But everybody knows by now maybe that this was channelled through advertising money and what have you. But now we don't even see that anymore. You sign in, you type something in, get something back and it feels really as if you are talking to someone but then it doesn't, you know, it has its limitations. But still, based on the massive resources that went into it in terms of energy consumption and the like and server accessibility of course these companies can deliver the service and it will be interesting to see by the way what will happen to this in terms of accessibility when the pricing models get in, when you can't do anything about that anymore. So that's for the one confusion I think, and the other confusion is I think between how we overlap what is happening in the realm of algorithmic management I think Katie, Francis you know about that. That's been with HR for a while already, right? And now we call it artificial intelligence and you know overlap large language modelling with very basic algorithmic management and I think that's interesting to see as well because I think we will see rebranding of tools that will be sold to companies - offered to companies. New market for consultancies which is always also good, but I think -\nNC: More snake oil salesman - that is always the case with any advanced technology, isn't it? That someone will come in offering to sell you something -\nKB: It just seems to be you know the claim now seems to be that its innovative and that you can't do business without - and I think that is really important. So, technology here is a big promise. But it's a tool still and the technology means you need to think about skills, about utilisation about processes about voice, about the human in this loop ha-ha. I that's, that's important to get that in mind -\nNC: But of course, it can be pretty disastrous when the human is not in the loop but Francis, I saw a story the other day. It was about an Uber driver who was told by automated HR to stop driving or be fired basically because he'd taken a very roundabout route. I mean in fact he had to go a different way because the river crossing was closed. Erm the AI systems had misinterpreted the data. The guy had to fight to keep his job. Now clearly, I know you're going to say, well, you should check this information. You shouldn't just let systems churn out results which affect people without checking them. But it does illustrate the fact that this is a mind thought for business -\nFL: Yeah, and I do think it is - I sort of think, at the moment, there is almost this dialogue of broadly either is the cheating on the exams or the robots are stealing our jobs. Erm or it's a toy to make [inaudible]. Where I think almost any example you could pull out would be true, but it would have also have been true before. And I suspect before there was any AI taxi drivers with threatened with firing for taking roundabout routes by human beings. So as ever that kind of thing if something looks odd the ability to investigate it and explore it and analyse it becomes much more and I think that's - to what Kendra was talking about the really, the human skills we need are more important I think than ever. And that for me is one of the things I find the most interesting that we need to examine what kind of skills do we need to hire for. Do we need to build? Do we need to maintain? How do managers coach people through things? And that I think particularly as being on a CIPD podcast I think that sort of the work, part of the work for our profession.\nNC: Okay, so Katie Obi, can you begin to talk us through the process of determining what parts of your business could benefit from a higher degree of AI? And then how you work it through particularly with regard to how it's going to have an effect on the people under the skills that they're going to need or not need indeed?\nKO: Absolutely. And I think one of the things that is really important to do is effectively embrace the chaos. You know AI is here is being used by your people. it's often being used by your people in ways that you can't control as well as. So, getting ahead of it is one of the most important things that businesses can do at the moment. And finding out the right ways to be able to use this great technology in a way that you do have the right governance and controls over it is the best thing that you can do. So that people aren't feeding your commercially sensitive information and IP to something that actually you have no idea what is done with that data. So, the first thing would be to really sit down as an organisation and think about how you want to incorporate AI in your organisation and how you want to handle some of the data privacy elements.\nThen I think once you have a strategy in place in terms of how you're going to think about adopting AI starting to pilot it is really important. I wouldn't recommend any organisation right now does a wholescale rollout of AI without testing in different places. And I think there are a few different things that you test. You have a hypothesis you go and form a cross functional working group around it. I think it's very important that this shouldn't be something that is just run by your IT team. You need to have people from across the organisation with different perspectives running the pilot scene if your hypothesis has proved and then you can go about rolling that out further. I think also one of the most important things that is going to happen and Francis, your point about additional skills you need is we will start to move away from some of the roles that we currently have in organisations and need others. So, we will need to have more roles around governance. People who are thinking through what is being created here. Is it driving to the right results? Is it being used in the right way? But is it also, is it also biased in anyway?\nAnd we were just on the topic Kendra raised around algorithms. Algorithms in some cases have been biased for many years and there is some really public examples of that out there. And they are biased because human beings are biased, and they've programmed them and then same with AI. AI is trained in a different way, but it's trained on data that humans have created as well and with that comes missing data especially from diverse populations and biased information as well. So, somebody who really has the governance around making sure that we are validating that the results are being generated are fair and ethical is really important. Plus, also, we're going to move to more of a type of environment for organisations where we're doing more feeding of the learning models as well. So, this is about what data do we have across the organisation? What knowledge do we have? How do we keep training the models to make sure we are getting better and better results? So, thinking about how we structure teams that are capable of doing that, which I think is a very different thing from what we do at the moment. And then the final piece I would say is organisations should do a lot of training of leaders and managers to understand more about the technology, more about the things they have to look out for and more about what skills are needed in the organisation going forward so that you can get the right buy in and adoption because like every technology rollout organisational change management is really important to make sure we get the most and it's used in the right way and it's adopted.\nNC: So, for what you're saying it seems to me that the kind of people whose skills will be in demand might be those people who are actually good at collaborating with AI who are good at those prompts that are constantly asking better questions to get a better output. But of course, Kendra, there will be job implications won't there? I mean AI can't do everybody's job but a month or so ago Goldman Sachs published a report showing that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full time jobs worldwide. PWC nearer home found a third of the respondents polled were worried about their role being replaced by technology and you've looked at automation. You know the in previous incarnations. What is your sense of how it's going to play out and how we actually ensure that we don't lose too many jobs and we actually improve the jobs that we do have?\nKO: Yeah, thank you. No less than that that's a big question of course because these global estimates are always prone to that many mirrors and they look pretty scary, but I think we have been through other phases of scaremongering and what is important I think a lesson we can learn from the last one is that not only can something happen such as the pandemic. Which also has not actually triggered that much of a tech increase than we had thought beforehand, right? The thing here is important that tasks if you reduce skills to tasks and you get rid of one task you are in danger of losing a skill because you might not be able to perform other tasks that make your job accurately in the future. What I mean here is think about a simple thing as learning other arithmetic in mathematics. So, there is evidence that students who never learned that at school actually never really engage with mathematics anymore because they just lose the foundations - it's like using pen and paper.\nNC: Children can't use maps, can they, anymore?\nKO: Exactly. So, we lose that - I know I am always happy to discuss this idea of GPS - you know the old word for that. So that will establish everyone, and I think that's really critical to keep in mind and what Katie has said is I think really important. All that has been outlined here means to be really cautious about where do we want to go with that. Who has a say in that. And also I think there is some evidence here from researchers who did research in the Silicon Valley that if you get to a point where you have the idea of owning ethics within your own organisation you make the people who develop it in part responsible for acting ethical and then tensions come in because businesses as we know are run by performance management figures like APIs by technical solutionism by meritocracy. So, who has a say in what and how strong can you make them, right? We had the debate about whistle blowers, and we will see that again and just coming back here to what Francis said that would be for me the distinction between the human interaction. I will never agree that anyone in the world can be unbiased in their decision. You know you will always find a biased full stop because biased is a bit of a pointless solution, yeah. It's a question in how have you thought about biased is and can the other person actually fight against it.\nNC: So, to just sort of round off talking about the skills that will need to be required Francis - how do you think things will change - I mean, Kendra has almost implied we might have a kind of a wave of sort of jobs that are fairly low-level teaching stuff.  Do you think that generalist jobs might go? We saw this hollowing out the last time that we had a big technological wave?\nFL: There are so many examples and there is a piece that I've started to think a lot around where the promise of greater productivity for lots of people is huge. But if let's say you are making pizzas - I will certainly not conceive - so there is a whole raft of roles in society that are not engaging with tech on a day-to-day basis, and I think on Kendra's point I think the risk of kind of social difference there is even greater. The bit that I think has seen a real shift in skills is I think the - need to pay attention to the route in developing skills because it's almost easier to get through say first stages of development of anything. Which is great if you already know how to do those but if you don't then your ability to integrate, I think is challenging. And I think the sort of skills around managing and coaching people become really different and if for a moment I could go back to the 1990s I taught for a couple of years in Sri Lanka in the 1990s you know days of dial up internet and so on and three kids that I was teaching history to well, I was really impressed they managed to source from the internet a whole raft of information about the subject we were doing. What they didn't do was then apply any judgment to it or put it in their own words you know so it was cut and pasted and stuck in.\nSo, the discussion I was having with them was hugely impressed they'd sourced things brilliantly but they'd then not applied the human judgment on top of it. And I think where we will need to get to in terms of skills is being able to say, okay, not did you use AI to help you but how did you use it, where did you get to with it, what were the questions you were using, what was the discussion you went through, where did you supplement it with your judgment? Who did you talk to, to back it up? So, you're kind of getting people to build the rounded solution and really getting people to look at how do you use those human skills to get to good solutions. If we don't do that my great worry, is we are just going to generate a load more stuff, you know, lots more content. Which then ultimately ends up with somebody having to make a decision about it and people who are already kind of bottlenecks in communities or just have more things that they pretend to read and pretend to make sounder judgements on.\nNC: Katie Obi, I know you want to come in on that. But I was just thinking earlier that if we think about how maybe simpler version of AI were incorporated into customer services with chatbots and everything. I mean they're pretty rubbish, weren't they? The public hated them, and they weren't achieving what companies wanted. I guess maybe they didn't go through this process that you were discussing earlier of rigorous trialling and all that. So, I mean we may be setting ourselves up for a fall here with the next wave of AI.\nKO: Yes, absolutely. And there is so much that I think we really need to unpack around this. I wanted to just maybe in defence of AI a little bit, I think Kendra and Francis raise really, really important points around the impact it can potentially have from a societal standpoint and different types of jobs. But I think there is also another side to that too. I think all things are true and all things need to be looked at very critically to make sure we are doing the right things and we're using the technology responsibly. I also think AI can open a lot of doors as well. So, if I look at Chat GPT type generative AI technology that will disproportionately impact white collar workers. Now I think there are lots of things to unpack around that, around generally it doesn't replace whole jobs it adds productivity to parts of jobs and that makes it difficult to say, well, 300 million jobs will be completely wiped out. It also creates more jobs in terms of the other things that need to be built around it to make sure that we are successful. I think also there are other forms of robotics that will impact blue collar jobs as well and all of these things are happening at the same time. I also think AI opens opportunities as well not just in new jobs that are created but if we look at GPT4 it can generate codes now. So, you don't have to go to university and do a computer science degree and learn how to be a developer in order to generate code. Yes, it's always worth having someone making sure that they're checking that code and making sure that it's been done correctly but doors are suddenly open to new industries and new opportunities for people like they've never been before. So, I just wanted to point out that there were two sides of the coin and without discounting the really important points that Kendra and Francis also raise that we need to make sure that we're very careful about how we reset this technology wisely.\nNC: Because people used to be valued for either thinking or doing, didn't they, Kendra? And the doing has been largely or partly taken over by machines for thinking we thought the people would have to do. It's almost like from what I've just been hearing there the boot might be on the other foot. That it's the thinkers that might be in less demand and the doers particularly those with practical skills who are not being replaced by machines they will still have work.\nKB: I think where I am coming from, I will always say the distinction between thinkers and doers is questionable in the first phase because I think a lot of doers - thinking about my own dad here ha. He's a big doer but he's also a big thinker.\nNC:  I was vastly over sympathising. If there is any enraged plumbers listening, I apologise.\nKB: I think we are really listening to the case against, and I think we're in this terrain where it is all important to remind ourselves that it's all about where do we create the spaces - these discussions like ours here can take place? At the moment we have a fast accelerator tech development that comes as a promise that is never questioned. Now my first question is, how much do we still fiddle around before we go on a zoom call - oh, your camera isn't here - we're a couple of years in now and still it's not working well. So, we know there is this ideal world where every technology works fantastically but instead the digital housekeeping, we need to do every day that's part and parcel of our jobs where we say, oh, I sent you this. It's in the Cloud X or it's in Provider Z - we don't know, right? So, what happens is that a lot of the productivity gains that are promised us are just lost because nothing really is implemented carefully enough so that we have always access to the same resources. And the other thing I wanted to address Katie; I totally agree there are real benefits - hence I would never say that something we discuss now is actually relatively new. I think a lot of these questions we had to ask for a while, so we are currently doing a project with engineers on how they perceive the shift was human centredness.\nAnd it's quite interesting because they learned modelling and engineering means you know, yeah, a model is always wrong but some of them are useful and then if you say, well, how about saying a model is often wrong but sometimes it's useful and it's right but it is also very dangerous. And then they start reflecting but they also admit that often they don't even have the resources, or they are given a project and then they are driven by their own adventures. They just want to do something, you know, this idea of doing something new that we all know. You think, oh, that's new, that's great, that's fantastic and then we forget where do we parcel that in? That would be my concern that our students the ability to ask the questions that are needed. I think that's a big issue. Education yes, we will benefit from AI but what is what the benefit gains so that we can use these times. Or will our workloads increase, and stuff will cut away and then well, what have we won then? We have increased student numbers because AI will help us, or we will go back to a model where I have more time to spend with my students on a face-to-face learning. Or HR in each of their organisations can they actually talk to people again.\nNC: Well, that's a good point. Erm - is it HR that are in the driving seat for this Francis, in terms of pushing organisational change?\nFL: It's sort of funny, in HR covid presented this huge demand on the profession but the demand was effectively on operational HR largely. I think with AI it requires the profession to think really quite differently. I will say it's a profession we love benchmarking what we do against each other. And you can't do that with things that are erratically changing really, at the moment. You know keeping up with the herd when the herd hasn't started moving is not really the answer. So, kind of benchmarking is quite tough. There is then things that hold us back like the way we've implemented technology into HR is tough and a lot of HR functions would struggle to get in the sort of technology pecking order and so kind of their ability to get into this is quite tough, I think. And I would love us to go to the profession and try and push on this, so we really do a number of things. So, one is look in as many ways as we possibly can throughout the colleague journey and really go where in this step of the colleague journey either can the individuals deploy AI to change things or the experts deploy AI or it's deployed into the process.\nAnd if I could just say one simple example everybody hates the kind of quarterly compliance learning modules. Every organisation has them we all hate them; we all click through PowerPoints slides as fast as we possibly can and then guess the answers. And if the aim is actually to make sure that people know 8 out of 10 things then giving people the ability to go and find that information for themselves in a faster manner and essentially have a conversation with something that will tell them the things that they need to know could be hugely transformational. It could save huge amount of time gets people to the things they really know. But it does completely disrupt a kind of suave of providers who have a kind of vested interest and that is true I would say every single step of the kind of colleague journey. So, I think our work as a professional is to get ahead of the link. How do we use this as well as possible. How do we encourage people to try AI to help them with productivity and then I think really importantly we use it to improve productivity and efficiency rather than just creating more stuff. Erm - the other great big people debate at the moment is really around things like the four-day week. If you take the potential of AI, it makes the possibility of four-day week far more kind of practical. That's my optimistic - my pessimistic thing is we're going to create so many things HR doesn't get ahead of the curb we end up writing policies telling people they can't use AI and then managing the generation of huge numbers and more documents of things that make us less efficient. I don't think HR is at the vanguard of it but I think we need to because it is that use of AI has humans that I think is going to make a real difference.\nNC: So, Katie Obi what would you add to that from your practical experience?\nKO: Yes. I mean, clearly, I'm biased in this given the role that I do. But I feel really strongly that the most successful companies in the next five to ten years are the companies where the people functions get front and centre of this and they really embrace it upfront. And to Francis' point the policy brigade going through this but they're the ones who really think about, well, how do we do things differently? And one of the best things that people functions can do is work out what skills we need within our own functions in order to be able to do this well. And it's skills like really being able to drive things like agile projects and the prototyping elements - it's skills around governance and assessing outcomes and biases and ethics. And it's also skills around data as well. So, I think if I look at people functions versus other functions in the business as much as it pains me to say it, I think that people functions are behind the curb of other areas of the business in terms of being data analytics led and we need to become ahead of the curb to do this. We have to work out how we're feeding all of the right data, how it all feeds together in order to get insights and in order to be able to take advantage of these technologies and it's a completely different skillset that we have in people functions. And I think if we can look at building those capabilities within our teams and combining it with the wonderful capabilities, we already have especially around been human centric and thinking about people's experience then that is where I think the magic is and where I think companies will be most successful.\nNC: And I was just wondering Kendra Briken from what you were saying earlier about do you actually need a new AI solution. What process do you think people should go through to decide if they should AI or not AI?\nKB: Maybe I'm picking it up from the end of the stick that Katie handed over there because I think that the skills are needed in HR - I mean we're teaching here at Strathclyde in the business school we are teaching masters programmes for AI so that's the future of the profession it's CIPD accredited and everything and what strikes me in teaching the students that come from across all different countries there is a lack of knowledge not necessarily with regards to data but what does the data signify? So, the knowledge about the simple social reality of work and employment is quite thin. To give you an example we did a project on the rollout of technologies during covid in social care. And the HR managers we spoke to they were kind of upset because they said, well, everybody knows how to use their phone at home why can they not use it to type in care notes to do this and that and that. So, all of a sudden, this smart device became the all. But they totally dismiss the social reality of social workers going into the home of a person and interacting their - you know wiping many things and doing things. To me this is something we need to consider when thinking what knowledge about data do we want and I think data here means it all needs to be the expert in knowing what work is done by the employees in the organisation and they need to know about that and not just by surveying it to create yet another data point, right? What you said about how do we make AI relevant, I think Katie gave us all the right points here earlier on. It's about testing, it's about resources and when we go back to what Francis said about fears I just fear from what I see. Tech is thrown into things because there are too many CEOs now thinking, oh, we need that, right? We need to have that. The question will always be do organisations think about it carefully when to join the bandwagon - are they prepared, do they have the resources, how do you manage the knowledge that is created. How do you make sure that the databases are up to date and all of that. These are all costs that might incur that are hidden at the moment and I still love this, I mean love as in a hate, love relation and the there was talks in 2007 I think about artificial artificial intelligence. Think about how many jobs you might simply create because people need to do all the analytic work and make it look as if it's all running smoothly, right?\nNC: Okay, so bringing this to a conclusion. Francis, you've touched on some of these issues. But just give us a quick tip or two about how you just start this process and with whom to reshape and reimagine your business models to incorporate AI technology?\nFL: I sort of think there is two approaches. And I think Katie was great at articulating the almost the enterprise view. We know loads of workers are using ChatGPT or other tools and they're kind of trying to do it in a hidden way in case they get into trouble or get told to stop.\nNC: Or they're getting it to write poetry.\nFL: Yeah, yeah -\nNC: Trivial - relatively trivial -\nFL: Yeah, so there is a piece of making it okay, showing we're paying attention, showing we're interested in it and giving people who are interested the opportunity to show you know kind of show their skills and so on. Doesn't mean you then follow through on everything that is discovered. There maybe things that people go, we want to do this, and you go, no, that's proprietary data or whatever. So, it's start but it's giving people that kind of encouragement to explore and the other thing we were trying to do - Kendra said earlier about this, you're not doing it from a position of power you're doing it from a position of curiosity or exploration. So, it's a kind of slightly different approach and some of that reflects a bit of my philosophy that I often think companies either behave like you can trust your employees or they behave like you can't trust your employees. And generally, I think whichever one you adopt is true.\nNC: We won't get into this discussion now whether you can always trust GPT, but it will give you some options. Thank you, Francis Lake, Doctor Kendra Briken, Katie Obi such a thoughtful and times mindboggling discussion. I'm going to have to have a lie down after this one. And remember we have these kind of conversations every month here for instance if you haven't caught it yet our previous edition on pay transparency generated a shed load of likes and shares. So please check us out and subscribe your podcast but since we've been all about AI let's hear how GPT4 responded when I asked it for a strategy to boost AI use.\nAI: That's a great question. A good strategy involves identifying potential use cases that can solve your key challenges or create value for your stakeholders, prioritise your use cases on criteria such as budget, data availability and expected benefits then you can develop a road map for implementation.\nNC: Until next time from me and my new AI friend.\nAI: Goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 33:56\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy:  Pay transparency is said to be fairer for all.  But is there reason to worry about what might happen if everyone knows what everybody else gets paid?  I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWell, thanks to pay transparency, we know that Gary Lineker earns a little bit more than an entire choir that the BBC had planned to axe but has been saved for now in the face of a furore.  Now, I don't know if Match of the Day calms your soul more than 20 singers performing Brahms German Requiem, but what we can be sure of is that going public on salaries is a big deal for any organisations, as it is for jobseekers and existing workers who discover what others are getting.  I was surprised to see almost two thirds of UK employees who'd just surveyed said they'd be happy to share their own salary details if it meant better pay equity; and that was generation Zedders especially.  Now, that's interesting because I thought we British hate talking about what we're paid or money generally.  So, how do you decide how far to go with pay transparency?  How'd you manage the likely fallout when your staff get salary envy or quit for a better paid post with your rival?  With me, to unravel all that and more, an HR director with experience in senior roles in financial services, and for major retailers, found on LinkedIn, says she's objective, impartial, supportive and fun, well we'll take that; that's Karen Jackson, HR Director at Reed. Hello.\nKaren Jackson: Hi.\nNC: Gemma Bullivant is an executive coach and reward consultant with hands on experience as a board level HR director, she says, \"Without a clear strategy, pay and benefits decisions will be inconsistent and ad hoc\".  And we don't want that, do we Gemma?  Hello.\nGemma Bullivant: Hello.\nNC: And from the home team, who better than the advisor who directs the CIPD's own research on performance and rewards; it's Charles cotton.  Hi.\nCharles Cotton: Hi.\nNC:  So, Charles, first things first, what do we mean by pay transparency?  I mean, is there a definition?\nCC: It rather depends on what you mean by pay and what you mean by transparency.  So, in part, it's going to depend on what the org... I suppose people, managers, and the organisation defines as pay; so, for example, does it include employer pension contributions, bonuses, or benefits in kind.  But this definition is also going to be influenced by what others define as pay; so, for example, internally, you have employees, you're going to have unions, the Remuneration Committee etc, each with their own understanding of pay.  And then externally, you're going to have stakeholders with their own definitions or understandings of pay; so, for example, the EHRC has their own definition of pay for when it comes to gender pay gap reporting, the HMRC has quite a wide definition of pay, when it comes to tax purposes, the Low Pay Commission has its own definition of pay, for when it comes to minimum wage purposes.\nAnd then you've got the other bodies, say for instance, in rugby union, the body that looks at the English Premiership, and they have their own definition for salary cap purposes.  And then it kind of depends on what you mean by transparency.  So, you can have transparency of outcomes, i.e., who gets what, or you can have transparency around processes, i.e., how pay award decisions are being made?, by whom, by, you know, when and why.  And you also can have transparency of context, so what do people getting the same or similar jobs, with the same employer, get?  Or what do these same jobs get with other employers? Or what do employees doing different jobs, within the same organisation, get?\nAnd then there's the issue about who you should be transparent, you know, transparent with.  I mean, is it going to be employees, potential employees, the media, unions?  As well as what level, so for instance one extreme, you could have individual levels, where each person knows each other's pay, or you can have aggregate level, so each person knows how their pay compares to their pay grade or how it compares like, against their gender.  Or you can have a mixture, so some individuals, so for instance in large organisations, you may list everybody's pay who's... you know, who's a board member, but the rest of the workforce, that kind of pay formation is kept at an aggregate level.  But hopefully answering all these questions will help create a strategy about how you talk about pay within and outside the organisation.\nNC: I guess there wouldn't be a simple answer to that and...\nCC: No, it's rather like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, isn't it, you know, life, the universe and everything.\nNC: Karen Jackson, there's also the question of where the transparency is blown, if you like, if you can say that an advertisement, or if a candidate is asked what they are paid.  Now, everybody knows all UK employers with 250 or more staff have to publish gender pay gap, just past the deadline in the last few days.  I know there was government pilot last year, employers were required to list salary information in their job ads and stop asking candidates what they're paid.  I mean, is this... are those two changes where we might go with pay transparency?\nKJ: I think it's down to very much what Charles said, it is dependent on what each individual organisation wants to do and how transparent they want to be, because it means different things for different companies.  I mean, I think there are absolute clear benefits when it comes to talent attraction; research from reed.co.uk found that four in five jobseekers, so about 78%, are less likely to apply for a job without a salary on it.  So, I'm interpreting that as keeping salaries secret is therefore likely to leave candidates skipping past your job adverts.  And actually, building on that, almost half felt that actually keeping the salary a secret would negatively impact on their perception of that company.  So, being open and honest about salaries you're advertising definitely leads to attracting more talent.\nNC: Do you actually tell your clients to definitely put the pay on or, if they don't want to, do you have leave it off?\nKJ: We advise to, but ultimately it comes down to that client's preference and depending on their particular pay strategy, from a transparency perspective, because there's so many different ends of the spectrum, to having complete transparency, where everybody's pay is public, or having really defined pay policies, and everything that falls in between that.  You know, we know, in a HR perspective, the role title of HRBP can be paid anything from 25,000 to over 150,000.  And, you know, that isn't helpful, if a salary is not declared within that advert, for example's sake, because I may choose to not apply for an advert if it's below a certain level.  And that's, you know, a personal frustration of mine.  So, we do apply... we do say to our clients, \"Absolutely this will guarantee you the most applications, if you're clear and transparent on the pay, or the pay range that's applicable to this particular vacancy\".\nNC: Now, Karen Jackson's made the case, Gemma Bullivant, for transparency, but there are all kinds of reasons why organisations, why employers worry about this, and certainly pay transparency has the real potential, when it comes in, to upset people, hasn't it, to damage morale, pits worker against worker?  I mean, why should anybody perform at their highest level if they know somebody that they might think doesn't pull their weight is getting paid more than them?\nGB: Yeah, absolutely.  And I think it boils down in some ways to a lack of comfort in being able to talk about pay clearly and transparently.  And that's informed by either not having a clear and transparent methodology, where you perhaps are carrying legacy inequities that you'd really rather hope nobody under... you know, ever notices, through to not even knowing whether you've got those inequities.  And I often work with clients who haven't really got round to analysing their data in that way, and really understanding where their employees lie within the pay spectrum.\nNC: But I mean, it could take it could take.... I mean, not just weeks, it could take years to sort your pay out, to bring people up to a level or to not give somebody else a pay rise, to put it bluntly, it actually could take a long time to get your house in order, in order for pay transparency to do its work.\nGB: Absolutely.  And that's sometimes a reason why employers don't even start because it seems like such a long, long task, a long... You know, a difficult and lengthy process.  But the flipside to that, of course, is that, if you don't start, you're never going to get there.  And sometimes there's a reluctance that, if we start on this process of understanding it, that somehow there's a budget imperative that we have to correct everything within the first year, and often a phased approach to gradually bringing a more structured balanced approach to pay is where companies end up.  But if you don't start, you're not going to get there.\nNC: And Charles Cotton, are you going to have to start?  Is this coming?  We know that several states in the US, the EU does this, some Scandinavian countries have always had pay transparency.  What, if anything, is pushing organisations into becoming more transparent?\nCC: Well, as has been mentioned, it's obviously the business, I suppose opportunities, in that you can set yourself out in the labour market and find it easier to attract talent.  Also, pay transparency helps in communicating, you know, what the organisation is trying to achieve and what it wants its employees to achieve, and how it's going to reward and recognise them for efforts.  And if you are not being transparent about that, then obviously it's going to have an impact.  But yes, there are also external pressures.  Organisations have moved along, publishing data by gender in the UK, some organisations are going a step further now and looking at ethnicity.  But there are also external pressures as well.  Organisations that have operations in the US are saying, well, because of pay transparency there, we're going to have to start thinking about how that affects on the UK, but also about our global operations more widely as well, you know, how's that going to have an influence there?  And similar, as you mentioned, the EU is also forcing organisations to consider how far they go in terms of transparency.\nNC: Certainly, the sort of, core effect is to help with inequality.  But we did quite an interesting little poll, just not a very scientific one, but... at CIPD, we asked people would pay transparency make inequality a thing of the past; 20% said yes, 5% said no, 70% said it's more complicated.  So, Karen Jackson, this does sort of slightly cast some doubt on whether moving to pay transparency even achieves narrowing those pay gaps for the disadvantaged, certainly in the first instance.\nKJ: I agree, I agree with the 70, that 70%; I think it can help because it can help to expose pay inequality, but it can't help in isolation, it's got to go hand in hand with lots of other elements.  And also, when we talk pay transparency, again, it's how long or how wide, or how clear does that organisation want to be, from a transparency perspective.  It won't be the fix, in isolation, for pay inequality.  It will go a long way, or it will go as far as that pay transparency enables it to do. What really needs to happen is that business need to tackle the more underlying issues which cause pay inequality.  There was a joint report between CIPD and Reed on the inclusion at work, and that found that nearly half of the employers had no inclusion or diversity strategy or plan in place.  So, without tackling this, we really can't start to tackle pay inequality.\nIt's got to go hand in hand with so many other elements, you know, in terms of how you might manage performance, role evaluation, job profiles, career pathways, you know, all of those types of things have got to go hand in hand with that pay transparency journey.\nAnd also, we've got to enable our managers to be more comfortable having candid conversations about pay because I agree with your introduction, Nigel, you know, there are still some people who are not happy having those conversations, either about their own pay or about people in their teams' pay.\nNC: Gemma Bullivant, does that chime with your experience?\nGB: Absolutely.  And I think that there's a real temptation to almost look at this in quite a binary way; we're either a very transparent... you know, on the extreme end of the scale, or we're not transparent at all.  And of course, what we know and what Charles was talking about at the start was, there are shades of grey, there are shades of grey in terms of levels of transparency, how we're transparent.  And I think for organisations where this is a very alien concept, to begin just with baby steps on transparency, to start to articulate to employees how pay is set, how you go about, kind of, determining what pay each role is awarded, how things... how the process works, is a step towards transparency without necessarily going all out and saying this is what everyone's salary is.  And you just figure out where on that continuum it feels like the right place to be in here and now, and where on that continuum you are aiming to be towards albeit, you know, factoring in what else is going on in the sort of, the wider landscape.\nNC: Well, quite so, because Charles Cotton, there are quite a few examples aren't there, of organisations that have paid quite a high price for pay transparency?  I mean, it is a charter to rival organisations, to poach talent they want, once they know the salaries they need to beat, so it can be quite inflationary.\nCC: Not necessarily.  I mean, people want to know why they're being paid, what they're being paid, and how that... you know, and how their efforts are going to be recognised by the organisation. So, being transparent about that is important.  Now, organisations often are concerned about their staff being poached, but pay isn't the only decision that people think about when they are thinking of moving jobs.  So, it may not...\nNC: Well, I'm sort of including rewards and conditions along with pay.  Though I suppose, as you say, it's a bit misleading that we just use the word pay.\nCC: Yeah, yeah, so I mean you've got to think about not only those contexts but, you know, why people are thinking of moving as well.  So yes, it's a factor, but it's not the only factor in people's decisions to leave or join organisations.  And also, if you kind of move from one organisation that is very transparent about pay or, you know, and benefits, to an organisation that has, kind of, poached you, but then isn't prepared to be similarly transparent, and then you may have issues later down the line, you may feel that you're... you know, you're not being rewarded and recognised.  You may wonder why... well, what are other people in this organisation getting paid.\nNC: Now, Karen Jackson, I noticed a few interesting findings people might like to look at, from Harvard Business School, that have been published quite recently. And one finding which surprised me was that, in their experience, and this may be in the US I would imagine, that pay transparency might actually cut pay because organisations dare not give one person a pay rise if... because it's public and they have to give it to everybody else.  So, is this a... actually a... possibly a sneaky way of holding pay back?  Though of course that's difficult, in inflationary times.\nKJ: I think that's incredibly difficult in inflationary times.  But also, for me, I think there's... I'm not sure how that would translate across the pond over into the UK. For me, I see it very much about understanding a view of how we establish what that job's worth is, whether that's benchmarking externally, whether that's benchmarking internally, but I don't see that as being a negative pay cut.  I don't think I've ever experienced that situation actually, from a pay transparency perspective.  I mean, for us, and sort of building on what Gemma said a moment ago, we have a range of pay transparency, sort of, guidelines that we use within Reed, and it comes down to, where we have our volume roles, we have really clear parameters of this is the salary range, if you're performing at a certain level.\nAnd then, where we have one [off] type roles, we are less clear, but what we will say is this is how, at inception of that role, we will benchmark.  So also, it's about saying you don't have to have a one size fits all pay transparency approach within your organisation; you can have a multiple of different approaches that might suit that particular population that you're looking at.\nNC: Gemma Bullivant, can you kind of take that on for us and just tell us a bit more?  You've already talked a little bit about this, but how you work with organisations to start sorting out how they approach this, how they talk to people, and indeed, how you should be doing those calculations as to kind of what people are worth.\nGB: Yes, well, there's a number of starting points.  Sometimes I start with, \"What is your aspiration?\" you know, but that's usually informed by, \"What's your challenge?\"  Because when I'm called, usually there's a challenge.  So, there's a challenge either in terms of attraction and retention, or there's a challenge in terms of wanting to know how much to pay people, regardless of some of the other pain points.  But most often, you have to start with understanding your job architecture, your roles.  It doesn't have to be a really detailed job evaluation exercise, but you do have to have some idea of how the organisation structure has evolved to the point that it's at now, and therefore what are the criteria that you might apply to describing the different levels of roles.  Once you've done that, you can then start to look at how you might benchmark externally and the approach that you might take to that.  And then you can start to, sort of, think about how you might determine the transparency approach or the way... let's use a different way of describing this, which is, \"How are you going to start explaining this to employees?\"  Because that's a version of transparency.  How can a manager or an HR leader sit down with that individual and just be able to articulate what's... how their pay is derived, what their pay progression might look like in that role, as they acquire more skills, perform at a better level or seek for promotion?\nIf you can't explain something to an individual in those terms, regardless of your approach to transparency, kind of, systemically in the business, then you're going to come unstuck.  So, you do need to have some of those basic principles, really kind of, you know, well thought through, to be able to then help with that explanation.\nNC: But, Charles Cotton, isn't the problem that we're quite wedded to the idea that you get a percentage every year, obviously with inflation, you know, as I mentioned before, there are certain imperatives there, but maybe people are not, sort of, up with the idea of a kind of assessment of the nature of your job, your own potential, and how much the job you're doing is worth relative to what's been going on in the world?\nCC: Well, I think the issue is obviously pay does cover many aspects, as you say, quite rightly point out, you know, it's the value of the job to the organisation, it represents the cost of living, the going rate, employee performance, achievements, potential, etc., and each of those elements will vary over time and there'll be, you know, one year the cost of living will be less of an issue than other times, similar you know, the going rate.  So, it's a kind of a balance; so each time an organisation looks at how much to increase pay, it has to kind of consider all those elements as well, as well as how much money the organisation has to pay.  And that's why it's important, as was mentioned earlier, about having a reward, you know, philosophy, strategy, and a narrative, to be able to explain to employees, \"This is why we are paying you what we're paying you.  This is what needs to happen, both in terms of what you need to achieve, or what the organisation needs to achieve, in terms to increase pay\", as well as, you know, how things may bear out in the future.  So I think also, what's important is, if you are going to be more transparent, you've got to... HR teams need to think about, well who are you going... you know, who... you need to decide, you know, who tells, who's going to tell what to whom, when, why, and how, and how much support HR professionals are going to provide to those people, either explaining it, or those... to those people on the receiving end, so they understand what's being communicated to them.\nNC: And Karen Jackson, I was struck by something I saw on one of Reed's online pages about all this; how you respond on pay transparency, you said, may depend on what story your organisation wants to tell.\nKJ: And that's absolutely right, Nigel.  It's about bringing to life what it feels like to work for that organisation.  And that isn't just about culture and how you feel; that's about where you contextually sit within that organisation.  And for majority of people, they will measure that on a number of things, and one of that is pay.  So that absolutely, that compelling story, absolutely will drive attraction to people, to your organisation.\nNC: Well, a large pay packet might.\nKJ: Well, of course a large pay packet will, 100%.  And I don't think pay strategy is about large pay packets; it's about being able to provide the context of why your pay is the way that it is, and how that fits with the organisation that that person might be interested in joining.\nSo that's why that compelling story is incredibly important, especially in today's recruitment market where, you know, we are quite candidate poor still in today's recruitment market.  So being very compelling and having that level of transparency could put you one step ahead of that competitor who's also trying to recruit that same person.\nNC: And Karen is talking about work context there.  Gemma, can you talk a bit more about the impact to transparency as it's introduced into the current way we work?  You know, we've got this hybrid working, we thought perhaps some of it might end, but everybody seems very keen on it not ending, very happy to work from home, employers have got more relaxed about that.  We've got an increasingly globalised workforce.  I wondered what extent local market rates might die out, you know, if we've got more perfect information, you know, I don't know, an HR manager getting 35,000 a year in the provinces might find a London counterpart was getting 50,000, might we expect those two rates to kind of get a bit closer over time?  Is that actually happening?\nGB: I think it is, and I'm starting to see that with clients that I work with, where the question starts to be posed around being able to hire outside of the local area because there is less of a requirement to come into a particular office or to commute on a very regular basis.\nSo, one longer train journey, once or twice a fortnight is very different to a four or five day a week daily commute.  And that's starting to put some pressure on to certainly my clients that are in in the north, that are starting to compete with salaries elsewhere, that are typically higher.  I think the other challenge, from a hybrid perspective, is I've got some clients who used to compete really well on flexibility and used to actually tell that story as a way of... not to pull salaries down below where they should be, but to almost tell the story of why they don't inflate the salaries or try to match other competitors, but they offer flexibility, they offer options on where and how you want to work.\nAnd that has very much equalised, which actually means that some of these clients that I'm working with are really struggling to compete on that point and are starting to have to think about their pay a little differently, because the market has shifted from that perspective.  So, there's a couple of different tensions there going on that are really starting to impact the question of pay.\nNC: Charles Cotton, do you want to add anything about this impact of how we work now?  Because you tweet a lot about rewards and things.\nCC: Yes, I mean, I think earlier on, when hybrid working kind of took off during the pandemic, there was perhaps a fear that organisations were going to introduce almost a kind of... a two-tier approach to pay, so those people that they recruited in lower cost areas, they would be offered lower wage rates, because their cost of living was lower.  But because of the tight labour market, that hasn't come to pass, so organisations seem to be paying people the same rate, irrespective of where they're based, leading to pressures that Gemma has just been talking about.  However, going forward, if there is a kind of, I suppose, if the labour market becomes more... becomes less tight, then perhaps you may start to see organisations reviewing those decisions to see whether there is merit in having different salary levels depending on where people are working.  But there are also issues around that as well, so for instance equal pay concerns could be something that kind of restricts that development.\nNC: And I mentioned at the beginning that, when people were polled about their willingness to be open about their own salary, it seemed to be the Generation Zedders who were all for transparency.  I just wonder whether, Gemma or Karen, have you noticed that kind of different attitude in the rising generation of workers?  Is that changing things?\nGB: Well, I think the earlier generations, and I count myself sort of within that, were actually used to it being perfectly fine to be asked not to talk about your pay and, you know, when that legislation changed and people were actually, you know, that became unlawful, that then shifted a culture away from employers sort of wanting that, kind of, that secrecy, to actually not being allowed to insist on that secrecy.  And I think as we move through the generations, that veering towards transparency is happening, and it's going to get... there's going to be more and more of a need for transparency or a demand for transparency, from employees.\nNC: Because I mean, Karen, there's this sort of paradox, isn't there; many feel, still, as we've heard, they do have a right to their own pay privacy, yet they simultaneously want to see what everybody's offering before they get involved in a job interview.\nKJ: It absolutely is a conflict there that is playing out.  I think, at the point of application, you don't understand that business.  And like I said earlier, that enables you to understand the context of where the role sits.  I think, pay transparency at a personal level, outside of generations, also has, you know, a real mixture of impact.  For example, it can really drive a whole imposter syndrome side as well.  \"Am I really worth that salary that I'm being paid?\"  And that has a whole ripple effect.  And that's not a generational thing, you know, that could be somebody new going into a new role, that could be somebody who's been in a role for ages, you know, so it's also conscious that yes, there's lots of positives that come with full pay transparency, but let's balance it with there's some clear negatives.  And that negative is not just at an organisational level; it's at an individual level as well.  And there will be some people, regardless of generation, that are uncomfortable with their personal pay being shared, because people may question their worth within their organisation, and we've got to be really conscious of that.\nNC: OK, that seems a great final thought from you.  So, Charles Cotton, what would you add just as a sort of final tip, if you like, to organisations, or individuals in HR who are really worried about what to do about this?\nCC: Well, I think not only do you have to, kind of, think about what you mean by pay and what you mean by transparency, and who's going to tell what to whom and what support they need; another is actually having the data in place to be transparent in the first place. So, you've got to persuade or make the business case to your organisation that they invest in the HR technology that allows the organisation to, kind of, collect the relevant pay data, to kind of analyse it and then communicate it in the right format to the right people, and at the right time.\nAnd also, being able to check whether the data you have is correct, because if you are analysing incorrect pay data, then the transparency process is, you know... what is the point?\nSo yes, you need to make the case saying well, we want to check the data, we want to have the technology that is going to allow us to do that, as well as then start thinking about things like legacy issues, crafting your narrative.  And of course, another issue is around data protection, if you are going to be transparent about pay salaries, thinking about what implications there are there.\nSo, when often you talk about pay, you often talk about reward or HR teams, but it's important to also think about the implications for other parts of the organisation; so, think about, you know, let's involve the legal team, let's involve the IT team, let's involve our colleagues in marketing and public affairs.  So, when we, kind of, launch our transparency initiative, we've got the right people in the room to help us talk about that.\nNC: A lot to take in there, but I know there's a lot of resources, both from Charles and others on the CIPD website. And Gemma Bullivant, final thought from you, from your experience maybe on all these tricky pay and reward issues.\nGB: I think my advice would be to assume that this is coming, and it's coming reasonably quickly, because the imperative is happening, as you mentioned at the start, from other geographies, and we know that it's the right thing to do, we know that it's quite a key lever in helping with things like gender pay gap.  So, as Charles said, make the case and get started on sorting the house out, understanding where your outliers are, understanding how you go about sizing roles, figuring out where in the organisation you might need to put more attention.  So, as Karen mentioned earlier, there might be sections of the business that it's quite straightforward, sections that need a little more of an individualised approach, and get that process underway so that, as you mentioned, it can take some time to get to a point where you want it to be but make the start so that you can actually gradually, you know, get closer to where you want it to be.\nNC: Brilliant.  Well, what an excellent discussion.  Thank you very much indeed. That was Gemma Bullivant.  We heard too from Karen Jackson, HR Director at Reed, and CIPD's Charles Cotton.  I think you've all performed well above expectations for your paygrades.\nLots of ideas.  Transparency on salary has definitely reached a tipping point.  Next month, ooh, something different, artificial intelligence, AI, how do you prepare for its inevitable impact on your organisation?  Until then, from me, it is the real and not AI generated Nigel Cassidy, and from all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:27:00\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy:    Enriching workplace learning. What are we missing when screen learning just takes over? I'm Nigel Cassidy, and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNC: Digital learning is the new normal, it's flexible and convenient, few organisations will probably choose to go back and rely on the classroom to upskill their people. And yet, could it be that we've got just a bit too cosy? Since the pandemic changed things, might have we become just a little bit too reliant on online everything? CIPD research suggests that we might be losing sight of the rich variety of ways that learning can be instilled so it sinks in. So this podcast is all about reshaping your learning for success, how to gauge what your organisation and its people expect, ways to challenge existing learning practice and the use of tools and data and more to, not only redesign learning, but make sure that you know that it's working. Well in a moment, it's our pleasure to hear from Jilly Julian of Jilly Julian Coaching and Development, she draws on 20 years' experience developing senior talent, and what she calls learning experience that sticks. Hi, Jilly.\nJilly Julian: Hi Nigel.\nNC: But first to set the scene for us, someone who we can rely on to mix things up when it comes to L&D, because he's CIPD's learning content manager, a welcome return to the podcast for David Hayden. Hello, David.\nDavid Hayden: Hi, Nigel, hi, Jilly, good to see you again. Yeah. So you, the, you mentioned there about redesigning learning and, and kind of, if we think about that word design, what is it that people hear when they, when they hear that word design? And, and, and, and what is, how do they translate it? Is it defaulting to designing a training course? Or is it thinking around how we design that rich variety of tools we've got to support learning and performance in an organisation? And that rich variety of tools that we can use on digital products, not just defaulting to a virtual classroom.\nNC: Yeah, because I mean, if we look at the CIPD research, it did highlight a, a lack of sort of evidence based principles to inform what programs look like, I mean, how they're designed. It's, it's almost as if deliberate and purposeful design is being neglected. How's this happened?\nDH: It's, it's really strange. So just 11% in our 2021 survey said they included any kind of explicit role for, for design. So that's, that's a role, not a person. But yeah, just over 1,100 respondents, just 11%, which is, which is really kind of low. Our 2023 survey's coming out later in the year, so we'll, we'll be interested to see whether there's any change on that.\nNC: I mean, Jilly, it almost seems as if, because of lockdown or something, we've taken up lots of good things, but it's kind of gone too far.\nJJ: I feel like there's something here about almost a kind of consumerist view of convenience that sits alongside some of the shifts that we've seen over the last few years, that have been maybe on the way already, but exacerbated by the pandemic and shifting ways in working. I think part of what goes along with that speaks to something that David just said about what we mean by design and what design looks like in organisations. Because I'm sure we've all had those conversations where designers started with right, we've got 20 minutes, or right we've got a day, and if we talk at people for a day about this subject, it'll be the knowledge equivalent of plugging them into the matrix and they'll know Kung Fu. It's almost like we can simply download knowledge and skills as opposed to the design stemming from, right, OK, organisationally what's happening? What needs to be happening? What do we need to achieve for our customers or our market or whatever the circumstance might be? And working backwards from that horizon sort of stage end point rather than saying, right, OK, yeah, we can release people for an hour.\nNC: OK. So David, let's start from first principles. What is the, the classic process then and how has it got distorted?\nDH: The classic process on a few people in my network has, has been, well, I open my laptop and I start typing into PowerPoints. And I, I, I pulled together, I pulled together a load of activities that I love doing, and then I try to think of what the objectives are. It's really kind of, yeah, doing a real disservice to the organisation and to the individuals coming through, coming through learning. And then we, we, we've kind of got some very traditional approaches to, to design in terms of the, it's commonly called the waterfall method, where kind of the, the, the, we go out and we, and, and we, we look at creating a wonderful program, but we've taken that long to create this wonderful program, the organisation's moved on and our data's way out of date. And I think one of the reasons why it's fallen out of favour a little bit is, it tended to take too long, and the perfectionist in us as learning and development seems to take over, rather than just wanting to offer a, a minimal viable product.\nNC: OK. So Jilly, talk us through maybe an occasion when you've gone into an organisation, and dare I say, you've seen a project rather like the one we've described. Tell us how you immediately tell something is wrong with it, and then just start talking us through with David on how you start a new design, beginning with presumably actually something that the organisation wants and needs to do.\nJJ: Ah, so David will attest to this for, from years back when we worked together. Back then, when we were all still very much in the mindset of very strict learning cycles and styles and lots of other things, that I venture to suggest we've moved on from to a large extent. The first question that we can generally come back with in any situation where somebody says right, L&D here's the ticket, go fulfil my order is, right, is this actually a training need? Because in many cases you wind up having a conversation that's actually about, there's something here that needs to be communicated, you know? People aren't performing in X, Y, Z way that you would like or expect them to be. Have we actually been really clear with people about that expectation and what they need to do in order to fulfil it already?\nNC: Just out of interest, Jilly, are organisation's surprised when you throw it back at them in that way?\nJJ: I'd venture to say horrified, Nigel.\nDH: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so Jilly and I worked on a, on, on a particular project a while back, and thinking what we've got in terms of rich digital offering, I once wrote a, a, a two hour training product on decoding a very formal certificate. I'll not say too much, because it might give the organisation away. But decoding a very formal certificate. What I would do now is, is, is create an infographic, because that wasn't a training need.\nJJ: Yeah.\nDH: That was a, I just need something to access at the point of need when I'm checking this certificate. So that is, but, but to have gone back to that organisation and say, no, do you know what? We'll save everyone two hours. I'd have probably been in a disciplinary.\nJJ: But I think that's indicative of exactly what we're talking about there is, I think there's this kind of really blinkered mindset that says, right, OK, learning is this and it must look like this, it must take this long, it must be on this platform or in this environment. Whereas actually now, the conversation's moved on so much more to things like, you know, performance tools and in the flow of work learning and how we enable performance in loads of different ways, which makes the conversation richer. But there's no point that just being an L&D conversation, because they'll still look at us like we've got three heads if we turn round and say, but what exactly is the need that needs to be fulfilled during that half day workshop, whatever?\nNC: I don't want to lose the thread, Jilly. You've already made this point that maybe you don't need a piece of learning, but just supposing you do, just talk us through what happens next. And, I'm bound to say, I heard you use this phrase, in the flow of work. So presumably one of the first things you might need to think about is, is this something people are going to do as part of the job that they're hopefully learning to do better?\nJJ: Yeah, absolutely. Really understanding the environment in which somebody is performing and expected to perform, and by understanding the barriers between them and that performance, then we're starting to see, OK, so where can we perhaps do some skills work outside of that environment? Where could we perhaps support in that environment in a way that doesn't detract from kind of productivity overall? I must admit, I am thinking about a fairly specific example here in my mind, that's quite a process based operational situation. But I think it applies in, in lots of areas, and ultimately it needs to come back to what, what people need to connect with as well. And dare I say it, how they need to feel about their learning and their experience. And I think too often, traditionally, there's that urge to just take people away from their environment. Like I say, that matrix style knowledge or skills dump, and put them back and expect them to feel great about that experience. Whereas no wonder people in that circumstance might have that natural assumption that this is very remedial activity, and I'm going to have an anti reaction to that, and I'm probably going to do everything I can to psychologically repress it.\nNC: OK. So David, take us a bit further along the design process.\nDH: OK, so there's a few different models that are, are, are gaining popularity, if, if, if you look at discussion threads on LinkedIn, influencer's blogs, those kind of things. So the first thing I want to say though is, is a nod to Jane Hart. Jane Hart has said a few times, you can't design learning, and absolutely agree with that statement. You can't design learning. Learning is something we do as humans that is, is, is unique to us. We can design programs that will allow for something to happen, ideally that would be learning and improved performance. But we, we tend to use designing learning as a shorthand for that much longer sentence. So, so I am, I am very aware that, you know, designing, learning, we're designing approaches to enable people to learn. But the programs that are, are being talked around a lot at the minute and there's, there's, there's quite, quite a bit around user centred design, the double diamond method from the design council, and human centred design. And what, what's interesting about human centred design, that's got its origins in the 1950s. So it's not, if anyone's thinking, oh, this is new, it, it, it's not. And actually it came from a guy called John Arnold, who suggested that engineering design should be human centred, and I just, I just love that kind of concept, 1950s people talking about human centred engineering, and it really kind of blows my mind a little bit. Bizarrely we, we, we can sometimes forget when, when we're designing learning that it's, it's about humans. All too often, you can see where a program has been designed for the process and not for the human using the process. So give you, give you an example of that. I go into a coffee shop and I say, right, can I have a black Americano please to take out? And the server has been really well trained in the process, you can see how well they've been trained in the process because they go, do you want that to take in or, or take out? Well, I've already told you to take out. But the process there says, eat in, take out. And then the next step, oh, coffee, right, do you want milk with that? No, I've already told you that I, I don't want milk. But the, they've been trained to the process, because the next step is, ask this question. So that approach takes the human out of it. It's, it's, it's, it's developing to the process. So yeah, anyone listening to this think about, are you designing to the process or are you designing to the human interaction that that process brings?\nNC: I, I get all that, and that's a very powerful story. I have seen, there was some research, I think it was from Deloitte, saying that increasingly, Jilly, organisations need to custom build their learning. They don't want to buy something off the peg. Is that because of this sort of thing? The fact that what you actually get just sort of vaguely suits your needs, but doesn't properly, and you get all these kind of things which make it cumbersome?\nJJ: I think there's, there's an element of that, and there's an element of everybody being very different and special and therefore wanting to see they're different and special reflected for very valid reasons. That sounds disparaging and I don't intend it to. But also I think, I want to come back on something that David just said there. Because one of the things that has to sit alongside that, whether it be bespoke development or kind of really off the peg, what sits alongside that is the environment that's created, that empowers somebody to feel comfortable to apply that knowledge and to step outside of that process, David, in that example that you gave there. And if you've not got that environment where somebody feels confident and competent then, or you can apply all of the, all of the solutions, all of the off the peg or tailored learning to that, and it's not necessarily going to change anybody's behaviour when it comes to that interaction with a man who needs his caffeine.\nNC: Do you think, David, learners are savvier? I mean, what do they expect do you think?\nDH: So our history, our history in learning and development is kind of continued from an educational basis where we, we, we put people in rooms. 2020 came along and we put people in, in virtual rooms. And so there, there's a whole host of people working in organisations what says, I've got to go on a training course. Which means they've got to go on something where they're going to have lots of words on PowerPoint slides and they're going have an 80%, get this, get, get this knowledge check and get 80% right. Loads of words on a slide and 80% of a knowledge check isn't great design principles. We are starting to hear lots of challenges to that, in terms of people saying, actually, do you know what? I want something, I want something at the point of need, I want something that I can access in a way that is relevant to me and my context. So those people who are entrenched to traditional design methods are, are, are going to find that the, the satisfaction rates are going to start falling down because people are starting to want different things.\nJJ: I'd go a step further than that, David. I'd, I'd suggest that perhaps it's not just satisfaction rates that are going to go down. It's people actually getting into those environments to learn in the first place. It's going to be people who are showing up --\nDH: Yeah.\nJJ: Because increasingly, at the moment with organisations under the pressures that they are, with individuals under the pressures that they are, nobody has the time to spend half a day doing something they've been told to that may or may not contribute to how effective they are at the end of the day.\nDH: To put a positive spin on that, because I kind of realised I've, I've, I've been a little bit negative. To put a positive spin on that, I have had a few different conversations lately, just this last couple of weeks, from very different sources where for instance, compliance, compliance training, as, as an example where people are starting to move away from, it's not about knowledge is it? It's, it's, it's about how people respond and behave, and the behaviours associated with our organisations being compliant. And yeah, few different people in very different industries starting to, to make that shift and that connection, and how do we design better to allow people to have the behaviours they need to be able to make sure our organisation's compliant? So that gives me lots and lots of hope.\nNC: And looking at expectations as well, Jilly, from the point of view of employers, do you think that they've changed? I mean, in the end, do they care how training is designed and delivered?\nJJ: I have to say yes, I have to. That might be the optimist in me, but I think they do care. I think what they don't necessarily have is the same specialist insight as somebody who is an L&D professional into how that then manifests. But I, I genuinely do think that organisations are making the links now between learning opportunities being a key part of engagement overall, everybody's working in a really employee led marketplace at the moment. And actually there's a lot of people out there who are deliberately seeking out the organisations where they know that they're going to be able to grow and thrive. Not necessarily in terms of the career ladder, but in terms of their overall skills and knowledge and that kind of investment in them as an individual. So I do think it is something that's probably higher on the agenda than it has been for a while. And I think part of that is probably, for all that I've said, there's a tendency to want to plug people into the matrix. I think it is the variety of ways that we can develop our, our colleagues and kind of the options that are out there now for organisations, to do this more effectively and cost effectively, that has probably woken people up to that a little bit more.\nNC: And there is a wealth out there isn't there, David? I mean I almost implied at the beginning that somehow there was something rather dull or passive about online learning. But I mean virtual is here to stay in so many forms isn't it? I mean live training simulations, panel discussions, there's all kinds of ways of mixing it up.\nDH: Absolutely. There is a real kind of rich, rich variety of, of digital tools that we can access, and, and really kind of build our design skills even further. So you, you've talked earlier about learning in the flow of work, so things like curating content to help with learning in the flow of work. We can't just throw a, a video at someone and say, hey, here's a video on presentation skills. How we build the, the excitement around that video, how we contextualise that video, and how we offer maybe some reflection points at the end of it, we can top and tail the curated piece in, in a really nice engaging way. So our design shifts from maybe designing five days that nobody's going to do anything with to, oh, here's, here's a five minute video that someone else has created, let's, let's top and tail this with, with, with some amazing stuff, or produce an infographic to go alongside it. Which can be really, really powerful.\nNC: But of course. Jilly, people are very different. How do you actually work out the best mix for a given situation?\nJJ: So David's talked about the richness of the different offering that we can put around this, the importance of kind of careful and considered curation and creating that, that opportunity for people to engage with their learning, and that emotional engagement as well, I think is hugely important. You know, we see people like Nick Shackleton-Jones talking about this a lot at the moment, the, the greater variety we can put around it obviously helps, but also it needs to work for the environment. It needs to be accessible for somebody, and frankly it needs to not feel like it's a huge, additional ask and a huge, additional task on the to do list if you like. I think there's something here to really consider about the way that people not just digest information, but the way that they apply what they get from it, and making sure that that application again, is surrounded by confidence and excitement to, to make that difference. Because we need to pull in all of those other motivators that constitute sort of great performance at this stage too.\nNC: And of course as, as I have learnt more than once from this podcast, it's not so much what you learn, it's how you reflect on it which matters --\nJJ: Absolutely\nNC: Which creates the change. David, before this podcast, we were just chatting and you, and you made reference to visiting the Design Museum. Now I would have thought that is a, a physical place where you go to look at an object and its story. I was quite interested that you were drawing a parallel between how you make a physical thing and how you design a program.\nDH: Yeah. So look, for me, the, the, the skills around design are, are, are common, regardless of what industry you're in. So a learning product and a chair, the concepts of the design are, are, are pretty similar in terms of, you know, you've got, you've got, you've got an end user, you've got a designer and you've got the materials you're working with. But yeah, there's, there's a rich, rich learning experience to, to the concept of design itself and, and Steve George and myself talk about that in the, in the book that we've just recently wrote, which I do need to give a public apology to Jillian for spelling her surname wrong in it. That didn't get past the edit, sorry. But yeah, just, just thinking around how, if anyone's seen the, the, the program Amazing Spaces, George Clarke just really kind of getting excited about bricks and mortar. And, and, you know, we, we need to get more excited about learning management systems and what they can do, rather than be frustrated around what they can't do and what they can't offer. So, yeah, be a bit more George Clarke is, is kind of my throwback from the Design Museum. Yeah.\nNC: I mean, David, hardly a day goes by without seeing something about AI chatbots. I mean, it's quite funny, isn't it, when they lose their rag or make mistakes, but I mean, who knows they might pinch our learning materials. I mean, do you think that we should be concerned about them? How might they help learning delivery?\nDH: There is a, a fair amount of chat and opinion around AI and chat, chatbots in, in learning. There's a couple of things, there's a couple of things in terms of, it's something new, so there's still a lot of learning ourselves to be done in, in, in this arena. One of my default go to on this is, is Donald Clark. So Donald Clark has, has written a book around AI in learning, and he's just kind of written a book around learning design itself, where kind of this features as well. With chatbot, there, there's, there's kind of different parts of the conversation going on, but I was heartened on LinkedIn to, to read, an HR director had, had asked a chatbot, is it OK for one employee to hit another? And got quite a few bits back. The first statement was, it's never acceptable for one employee hit another. But as the conversation got a little bit more complex, the advice from the chatbot was to get advice from an HR professional. Which so, so, so she took great heart in that, that it, that it was programmed to make sure that you were getting correct evidence. It, it's definitely worth kind of diving into it a little bit deeper rather than just looking at the headlines.\nNC: So, Jilly, would you say you've got an open mind about AI?\nJJ: I've got an open mind about most things. And I think with these things, if we take it in the spirit of, there's the potential there for tools that may be helpful, but that we keep that inherent curiosity that makes us what we are as learning professionals, then that feels like a healthy way forward. So that we don't embrace it as all of the everything, and it'll be the panacea and the answer to all of our, all of our problems. But also nor is it necessarily the root of all evil. I think, any, any kind of new development like this, we get, we run the risk of being over excited and perhaps distracted dare I say. Whereas actually it might, it might wind up being a useful tool in a given situation, but let's make sure that we keep it as kind of one of many options that we've got available to us. So healthy curiosity will be my council.\nNC: We've covered a lot of ground, coming up to our final thoughts, David Hayden, just a very short checklist things to do to make your learning better?\nDH: Get better at knowing what makes learning better is my top tip. So do some reading in this area, so I've mentioned Donald Clark, Jilly mentioned Nick Shackleton-Jones, you've got Neelan and Kirschner's evidence, evidence informed learning design, (inaudible) phrase evidence informed. You've got Nelson Sivalingam, sorry, Nelson if I've said that wrong. He talks about lean learning sprints, which is just fabulous. So you've got a design methodology there. So yeah, have a read of that. Andy Lancaster, Michelle Parry-Slater have both done some stuff and (inaudible) and Hayden have got a whole chapter dedicated to design. So yeah, refresh yourself what learning design is, is, is my top tip, role model it.\nNC: And Jilly, the secrets of better design for you?\nJJ: Keep that purpose for the design in your mind at all times. Don't just think about necessarily who's actually going to be learning in this circumstance, think about who are the people that they're going to impact? Get as far towards that horizon as you can, and make sure that all of those perspectives play into how you approach what you're doing. But first and foremost, please make sure that we're not just thinking about like, right, let's communicate these process elements here. Let's think about the emotional environment and the context, and let's work with our organisations holistically to make sure that people are in the best possible place, not just for learning, but to actually do something with that.\nDH: I'm guessing Jilly, if we, if we knew that 15 years ago, yeah.\nNC: Never too late to learn.\nDH: Never too late to learn. Yeah.\nNC: Brilliant. Well, our thanks to both of you, to our learned duo this month, CIPD's David Hayden and Jilly Julian of Jilly Julian Coaching and Development. Just time to mention last month's exploration of cultural intelligence, it sparked a lot of interest on socials with particular attention to highlighting the potential benefits of greater cultural awareness on the bottom line. For example, coach Manuel Guidant mentioned, following the framework discussed on the podcast by one of our guests with his clients in four different global regions, would have made a significant difference to productivity and projects finished on time and on budget. Impressive. Well that and another CIPD podcast editions can easily be found if you listen back via our podcast page.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:32:45\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: How to tune into the values and communication styles of people from widely different backgrounds. It's time to boost your cultural intelligence. I'm Nigel Cassidy, and this is the CIPD podcast. Now today, few problems get solved or business gets done by individuals operating solely within their own culture. Almost everyone at some time needs to collaborate with people whose ways, whose ideas, working styles or preferences are unfamiliar or maybe hard to read. And it's a no brainer that we need culturally intelligence staff, people with chameleon like abilities who can get on others' wavelength. And it's also fair to say that training in this whole area sometimes falls short, still focusing on information about different cultures. So in this podcast, we're going to try and take things to the next level, dipping into the latest and smartest scientific research that can show us how to develop and use cultural intelligence to build trust and win customers and unleash diverse teams. With me this month, Ritika Wadhwa, chief operating officer of the research based training and consultancy firm Cultural Intelligence Centre. She's 25 years' board level experience bringing inclusion and innovation into the heart of organisations. Hello.\nRitika Wadhwa: Hi, Nigel. So glad to be here.\nNC: And Rob Neil, director of the equity in the workplace consultancy Krystal Alliance. He's a former senior civil servant who was awarded an OBE for services to race equality in the workplace and the community. Hello.\nRob Neil: Hi, Nigel. How you doing?\nNC: So, Rob, I mean, there's a lot of definitions of cultural intelligence around the theme of, one I saw, having a natural ability as an outsider to interpret others' unfamiliar or ambiguous gestures as if you were their compatriot. And that's quite a bland but descriptive term. What's cultural intelligence for you?\nRN: Well, it, I'm bound to say, Nigel, in that rather padded out definition you shared, I'm not sure where it came from, that there's a lot of essence of cultural intelligence in there. It is about that ability. But you asked me what I think it is, and it's very much for me about how capable one is to operate and function, indeed, relate with effectiveness in those culturally diverse situations and, indeed, contexts. And I mentioned contexts because beyond what some may feel is the, kind of, natural definition of culture, i.e., ethnicity, nationality, race, and all the nuances that they offer up, culture in this instance includes all of that, but it moves beyond that as well. It talks about National Geographic. It talks about organisational culture as well. It speaks to all of that. So when we pare that down, when we knock off the froth in any of that, what we're looking at, Nigel, is the capability to function and relate effectively in culturally diverse situations and contexts.\nNC: Ritika, that really speaks to what I discovered, just trying to mug up a bit on modern CQ, is that it does go a lot beyond just learning to be culturally sensitive and aware. It's something which as much, or more, goes on within you, rather than just what's going on with the other person that you're trying to get your head around.\nRW: Wow, Nigel, you have done your homework, haven't you? Just picking up on where, what Rob shared there, the norm of culture, really. I want to go back to, culture is the way we do things around here. And so cultural intelligence in my definition is the ability to work with people that are different from us. Ability, capability that we can all develop. So how does it become an individual skill? It's a learning journey. You can't attend a workshop or learn, mug up the definition of cultural intelligence, become a culturally intelligent human being. It's a journey we need to go on. First, identify which parts of cultural intelligence we want to develop, and those are the four capabilities. Do your assessment. Find out where you need to develop your cultural intelligence.\nNC: Sorry, you just said those are the four capabilities. So what are they?\nRW: So the four capabilities, which is the cultural intelligence framework, starts with CQ drive, the why, the motivation for you to be able to work with people that are different from you, the persistence, the frustration that we sometimes feel with some cultures, i.e., my culture is that I'm a woman, but I find it frustrating to work with men, let's say. So identifying that within myself and understanding my why is the CQ drive. The second capability is CQ knowledge, the what. It is what we know, what we want to know more about, the differences within cultures. The third capability is the CQ strategy. How do we plan for these multicultural interactions knowing what we know, the what. And the last capability is CQ action. How do we behave in situations that we are not familiar with, having used that framework holistically?\nNC: OK. So I know that you use that framework professionally. I just wonder, Rob, I've also seen references to metacognition, cognition, motivation and behaviour, perhaps some slightly older science there. Is that kind of the same thing? I mean, we don't want to get too stuck on these definitions, but it does come down to working out what these headings are that you need to look at.\nRN: Well, yes, like anything when it comes to the language, Nigel, you get into levels. Some people make it their business, indeed, their art, their skill, in taking language to a more, what's often termed sophisticated. Sometimes it can become confusing. You know, we've got people working in academia, people working in interaction with the public. And so language is all important. And you do have to, as part of that cultural challenge, you need to be able to adjust. You need to be able to understand what's being said enough to respond to it. So when we talk about meta or metacognitive, I like to very often break things down. I'm not an academic. You know, I grew up bypassing a university until I was much older. So I actually entered the workplace without going to that level of education, and then learnt, if you like, on the job. So when I look at the capabilities, as have been beautifully outlined there by Ritika, the why, the what, the planning and the behaviour, we are talking about what goes on on the inside, the intrinsic motivations, the intrinsic development of cultural intelligence, that, you know, the appetite, the curiosity, the building of your internal library, the knowledge, what you know, and how you can build on that. You carry that with you, and then you segue into the external stuff or the extrinsic stuff. And it, there, Nigel, we're talking about your published declaration, the planning, the action plan, the strategy, the guidance, the statement, the code of ethics, stuff that everyone can see tangibly. So you use the fuel from within, the appetite, the curiosity from within, and you convert that into an outward sign of what it is you're carrying with you. And if you take that into an organisational context, you begin to see that culturally intelligent leaders do well in converting that internal motivation, that intrinsic stuff, into the extrinsic offer to those around them.\nNC: And you talk about outward signs. And of course, one outward sign, Ritika, is that we do have organisations which are, or are supposed to be, diverse and inclusive by design. So if that's the case, why do we actually need to do further work on this? I mean, why do we need to seek cultural intelligence as a thing if our workplace is already supposed to be diverse and inclusive?\nRW: I think the keyword there Nigel is supposed, yes? If I can pick up on that.\nNC: Yes.\nRW: So is it?\nNC: You read my drift there.\nRW: Yes. We didn't plan for that, but that worked naturally. So, in a nutshell, Nigel, in a nutshell, how I would articulate that is, ask yourself the question, do you want to be an effective leader in a diverse, digital and divided world? If the answer to that is, yes, then you need to go on this journey, because the fact of the matter is that we are living in a diverse world. And just because there's diversity or supposed to be diversity, that doesn't mean that will lead automatically to productivity or innovations. If those diverse teams do not know how to work with each other, don't know how to communicate, do not come from a place of respect, creating a psychologically safe environment for each other, that will not get the results that you look to get. In fact, it's the opposite. Having homogenous teams, those that look like each other, think like each other, it's easier for them to work together. When you throw diversity, which you're supposed to throw into the mix, if you do not have cultural intelligence, that diversity backfires and is counterproductive.\nNC: I mean, clearly, this is something that you should want for yourself because it's the right thing for your organisation. Is there any sense that you might or you could do this simply because your organisation might perform better or do better business?\nRW: It starts with an individual journey. And this is where we go back to the CQ framework of the CQ drive, which is, what do you as an individual want to achieve in your effectiveness? And then, as an organisation, what does that translate into? What is effectiveness for the organisation? What outcomes are you looking for as an organisation? And that's the CQ drive. If your motivation for the why is clear, your business case for the reason for developing cultural intelligence and going on that journey becomes clear.\nNC: OK. So Rob, do you want to, sort of, take it from there and, sort of, maybe talk us through examples of areas where better performance in this area will pay dividends for the organisation? I mean, this could be anything from, I don't know, negotiating more effectively, to being a better leader, being a more profitable organisation or what?\nRN: Yes, sure. Just to recap on one of the questions you posed Nigel, when Ritika quite rightly picked up on your word supposed to be, we only have to look at a range of evidence empirically when we look at workforce in any of the sectors across the world. I'm focusing on the UK because that's where I'm based and that's where I work. But if we look at our public services, if we look at our private sector boards and the FTSE 100, if we look at the spread of resourcing across the charitable sector, we can see disparities almost by every dimension of diversity, whether it's, you know, less than half the boardrooms filled with women, whether it's the absence of people of colour in those decision making spaces in the public sector. When we look at how funding is allocated in the charitable sector, there is more than a theme. There is disparity that has certain groups of people losing out, and not just losing out from within the organisation, but almost by extrapolation, losing out by the service that that organisation provides to the people that it's there to meet the needs of.\nAnd so leading up to your next question, we are able to benefit from the evidence that is around us. Some organisations measure this stuff well. And so their navigation of what needs to happen, their ability to understand, acknowledge and act on what's needed is more efficient. And so they can say, let us set targets for recruitment of X people at Y level, because we are underrepresented in that space. And almost as a flip side to that, some organisations measure it badly, Nigel. They ignore the data. They measure the wrong things. They haven't got the appetite for this stuff.\nAnd I like to think of, what is it that drives us to be more inclusive? I would contend there are three main things that drive us. There's the moral driver. We do this because our hearts tell us it's the right thing to do. And to include everybody as best we can is the right thing to do. There's the legal driver, the legislative driver, the force of the law. And it may surprise you, you know, many senior leaders will get around the table when they recognise and acknowledge that if they don't do certain things in the organisation, they might be hit with a lawsuit. You know, there might be an employment tribunal that punches a real hole in their budget. And then that segues into the economic driver. You alluded to it in your question there, Nigel. This makes economic sense. Many a report, McKinsey, Forbes, Harvard Business Review, they have conducted numerous exercises in demonstrating that the more diverse your senior leadership teams, the more diverse your decision-making spaces, the greater innovation takes place. Once those diverse people get to know each other, think of Tuckman and the stages of team development, forming and storming has these two teams, homogenous and diverse, almost neck for neck and no real discernible difference. Indeed, as Ritika says, the homogenous team will move more swiftly into what needs to be done because they know each other. But the moment the diverse team starts norming on the doorstep of performing, the moment the diverse team gets to know each other and they really unpack all of the wonderful synergy, the richness of that difference, the homogenous team cannot keep up. They cannot keep up with that diverse team. The diverse team soars often into the distance in terms of innovation, effectiveness and creating solutions to the challenges that they face.\nNC: And talking of storming, Ritika wants to come right back on that.\nRW: On the storming. Your question on the benefits, I just want to, sort of, you know, allude to what Rob has shared there and go to what our research within the Cultural Intelligence Centre has found. Organisational benefits of being a culturally intelligent organisation is improved productivity, reduced conflict and misunderstandings, profitability and cost savings, and reduced employee turnover. Those are absolutely the organisational level benefits, but of course, there's also the individual level benefits of being an effective leader, of better judgement and decision making, better personal adjustment and adaptability, and to be able to sell an influence across a range, diverse range of people.\nNC: I want to ask you both about improving your cultural intelligence performance. I mean, if we were to take IQ, Rob, I mean, it's a moot point, isn't it, amongst scientists as to whether you can boost your own IQ, your natural intelligence with practise? I mean, I'm rubbish at all those tests. Does the same apply with CQ? I mean, how valuable is training? I mean, some people, we know, are naturally sensitive, they're more tolerant, they're better at reading others. Others have an innate tendency to stick their foot in it and cause offence. So to what extent can you take people on this journey and really show results?\nRN: Well, I start with myself as an example. I first took the CQ assessment now, what are we, five years ago, and I have taken that CQ test at different levels and different exposure to involve other pieces of feedback from other individuals as well. And I have improved my CQ score, my CQ capability, and as Ritika shared earlier about the four key capabilities, I have consolidated some of those areas in which I happen to score high, drive and action. I was scoring high off my first assessment on those two capabilities, but I was very low on CQ strategy, worryingly low, and I was moderately low on CQ knowledge. But therein lies the beauty of CQ, as indeed with most assessments, it's no different really. But once you've shone a light on that, once you are aware of that, and you are on that journey to improving it, you actually are able to consolidate your strengths, protect against burnout, you know, share the load with others. Understand there is a choice often when it comes to action, not just the first thing that comes into your mind. Those were some of the pitfalls that I was falling into, Nigel, and in so doing, Nigel, freeing up time, freeing up energy, to focus on my knowledge building and my strategy production. And I was able to do that in, and as part of, my day job, at the time a civil servant. So I even got better at those tests, Nigel, that you referred to, because within the civil service, many will know if they're listening to this podcast, you get a battery of verbal non reasoning, all kinds of tests, that at the get go, at the very start, I was not much good at. I got better at them as a result of improving my CQ. And of course, what you are introduced to along the way are approaches, such as what's offered in Daniel Kahneman's work, Thinking Fast and Slow, System 1, System 2 thinking, you can exercise different parts of your brain. And as with any iterative process, and if you're putting yourself in the way of difference, what begins to happen is you begin to increase your appreciation of difference, your interaction with that difference. And so you get better. Invariably, you get better. It's like building a muscle. It's like going to the gym. You are on that journey. You will gradually get better at improving and demonstrating your own cultural intelligence.\nNC: But clearly one of the drivers for you was the fact that you really wanted to do this. And you really understood the benefits of working on some aspects of yourself. So Ritika, how do you engage people with this? How do you convince them this isn't just another initiative, along with the diversity inclusion, but this is something which is good for people, which is good for organisations?\nRW: The way I convince people, and luckily I haven't had much of, much convincing to do so far, is really understanding the nub of their issue. Because everybody has some challenge as an individual, as a team or as an organisation that you're looking to solve.\nNC: I mean, are there any examples that spring to mind of people you've worked with, of changes that --\nRW: Lots --\nNC: Your work has --\nRW: Lots of --\nNC: Helped?\nRW: Yes, absolutely. So how do you develop empathy in leaders, so that they're able to give better feedback to their staff, in a culture where you're hiring people that is just high power distance, hierarchy is everything, when you then hire someone that is low power distance, does not enjoy hierarchy, just enjoys direct communication versus indirect communication? Just understanding those different cultural values and understanding those challenges is all it takes. It's all it takes to, because the cultural intelligence, the framework, is so adaptable and flexible that you tell me what your challenge is, and I will be able to find a way to resolve it by using this framework.\nOne of the clients that we work closely with, she's born and brought up in the UK, but as a Muslim woman in a very cultural context of being a Muslim woman in a Muslim household, where hierarchy was everything. And she went out to work in the world. She's born and brought up here, educated here, went to school, university, all of that, and went through all the other tools and assessments that are out there, until she stumbled upon CQ. Then she said to us that CQ is the only model that has actually given language to how I have been feeling in the workplace. So the way my cultural background translated into the workplace was that I was only hiring people that were high power distance, because I am high power distance, hierarchy means everything to me. Until one individual that was hired in the team had low power distance, doesn't care much for hierarchy. The friction came into place. It's only when we understood that the whole team sits on one end of this spectrum and this one person sits on the low power distance, that's when we understood how we could work better together.\nNC: That's a very powerful example, things really fall into place when you put it that way. Rob, I've got quite an amusing book on a shelf at home, which is all about famous blunders in international business. I mean, the one that springs to mind is the launch of a new car model called Nova, which, in Spanish is, you're probably ahead of me here already, that means doesn't go. Not a great name for a car. A more recent example that springs to mind is the US beer company Budweiser's multimillion dollar sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup. That in a teetotal Muslim country that subsequently told them, you'll remember to take the beer tents away from the venues. Is that about cultural awareness or is that just poor business research? I mean, a bad business decision? I mean, would CQ have helped there?\nRN: Well, it, firstly, it's both. Would cultural intelligence and the effective level of cultural intelligence have spotted that? Yes, it would. And I can give you another example. I not too long ago worked with one of our high street banks. Let's put it that way, so as not to embarrass them. They'll know who they are if they're --\nNC: Let's hope so.\nRN: Listening to the podcast. And we were talking about how to potentially incentivise an under represented group of people in that organisation to go out and speak with their family members, and indeed their friends from the same community, to apply, the talented members of their family, the talented friends amongst their group to apply to join this high street bank. And we're talking about members of what's previously known as the BAME, Black Asian Minority Ethnic, I think, but the black community. Now, they had drafted, this high street bank, a scheme to incentivise those individuals, and they wanted to call the scheme a bounty bonus. Now, what some people may not know is that word, bounty, in that same community is a derogatory term for someone who appears to be, black coloured skin on the outside, but is acting in a white way, whatever that --\nNC: It's --\nRN: Means, Nigel.\nNC: It's --\nRN: And so --\nNC: Another show there.\nRN: And so to incentivise a group of people with a derogatory term. Now, I was quite quick. I'm quite, I'm an extrovert by nature. I know that about myself. So I try and, you know, manage that. A little bit of Rob goes a long way. But I also know that this would be a real flaw in their strategy. This would be a major loss of money well spent if they were to introduce a bounty bonus, because many of our, members of our black, Asian and minority ethnic community would not sign up to such a scheme. So we were able to change the name of the scheme. We were able to get the branding right around the scheme, and that scheme went on to be embraced and a success in delivering not just more applicants, but more successful applicants into that high street bank in less than 12 months' later. And it seems like a very simple thing, doesn't it? But going back to my point about language, we can just be one degree out at the beginning of our journey, but it puts us in a completely different place by the time we complete the journey if we don't pay attention to it. Hence, your Budweiser example.\nNC: So Ritika, making a plan. I mean, you've already mentioned your framework, but I mean, where do you start and with whom?\nRW: So the first thing to do would be to get your employees to take an assessment, tweak their interest on where their CQ scores lie, because everybody wants to know where we are at on that spectrum. It's about you. So it takes 20 minutes to do the assessment, you get your scores, and that straight away will tell you where the interventions are needed. And then there is various ways to go about. You could e-learnings, webinars, blogs on various websites. Yes, a plethora of options on how you can develop a plan for an individual and a team and an organisation.\nNC: And Rob Neil, you've got to tailor that plan fairly carefully, haven't you? It is a bit hard to know what works. I mean, should you offer courses? Should you sponsor a, I don't know, multinational lunch? Get guest speakers in? Have team building exercises?\nRN: Those all tickle, Nigel. They're all great ideas. And part of what I would say is, look at the platforms, look at the spaces in your organisation where the exchange of cultural knowledge, the exchange of cultural norms and know how and ways of doing things actually occur, and increase those. So if you haven't already, think about introducing a reverse mentoring scheme, where people who typically sit higher up the organisation are encouraged and motivated to spend time with those lower down the organisation. This will begin to erode some of the significance around power distance. It will increase the exchange of cultural knowledge. It will inspire sponsorship activity, where people identify talent from elsewhere and help them navigate the otherwise labyrinth of organisations. When starting team meetings, put the agenda, the work agenda to one side, just for a moment, and ask, invite people to check in. How are you feeling at the moment? You know, what's work like outside of work? Hear from people and their heart about how it is to work in this space. These are moments that become precious exchanges, that feed into the cultural intelligence, the residual cultural intelligence that occur. If what's waiting for people on the other side of those exchanges is a bright light on where they may sit on their capabilities, their drive, their knowledge, their strategy and their action, what they can then do is set about prescribing for themself the journey ahead. What do I need to work on? Do I need to increase my appetite and curiosity? Do I need to mix up those that I'm linked in with? Or those that I follow on Twitter? Or the books I read? The podcasts I listen to? This is a good one. Or looking at other things that they might be doing. How can I open the ears and the eyes, the gateways to my soul, to increase the amount of difference that I'm enjoying in life, in order to inform my journey ahead in improving my culture intelligence? These are things that all organisations can do.\nRW: To Rob's point there, it's that whole why, isn't it? If, as an individual and an organisation, I understand my key driver and what are my challenges, then it's very easy to understand what is it that I need to gain more knowledge on and how I can then plan. So it's the why that needs to unravel before the planning comes into place, because that will fall in naturally.\nNC: And Ritika you describe cultural intelligence as a critical part of setting yourself apart in today's globalised world. You mentioned artificial intelligence, machine learning and innovation. So as we, sort of, try and bring this to a close, I mean, what are you really saying there about the importance of cultural intelligence for all our futures at work?\nRW: The importance is immense because there is a piece of research around, you can understand the research basis on why cultural intelligence is needed, but it needs humans to change that behaviour. It's humans that will bring the behaviour change into the interactions. And so humans need cultural intelligence from a digital perspective in that digital world, because we do interact with each other. There is the fact that it is a divided world. It's more polarised than it's ever been. So how can we have those conversations that bring us together as a humanity to make the world a better place? And the fact that it is, you know, it is a diverse world. It is a multicultural world. The fact that it should go beyond nationalities and identities. We are living in a place where people are precious about who they are and what their identity is. How can we respect those identities and meet them at a place where they want to be met?\nNC: And the thing that struck me is that this is a lot more practical than I thought. It's about, you know, what you do yourself once you've got your score and once you understand yourself a bit more. And I know, Rob, you wrote on a civil service blog that it enables people to consciously identify their biases and find strategies for managing --\nRN: Yes.\nNC: Them. So this really --\nRN: Yes.\nNC: Is as much about self discovery as it is about fitting in with others.\nRN: It absolutely is. And it's worth mentioning that CQ in its growing form, in its acceptance and the way in which people are now engaging with it. It's worth noting, Nigel, that it's not, it hasn't arrived to replace IQ. It's not instead of EQ. It's an additional quotient that, if anything, marries those two things and works in addition to. I like to refer to it, by the way, as the secret sauce, but that's the wording I choose, because for me, having spent over two decades in the learning and development space, having worked as a trainer across all the sectors, when I first bumped into CQ, it struck me that this was joining the dots. This was a way in which we could absolutely continue to engage and embrace IQ, work with continuing to develop our EQ, what the heart has to say about these issues, but then we can start looking at how we actually work with difference. How do we work across those cultural contexts? And so whether it is through the employee engagement surveys, whether it's by looking at our workforce and delivering on those targets, one to ones, the raft of tools available through CQC centre and other places that offer this learning. I think there is an opportunity for us now to marry those quotients and to say how they work together to have us operate more effectively is a powerful way forward, and is what I'm full of hope and excitement for as I work with teams and organisations across the UK.\nNC: Brilliant. Well, great stuff from both of you. Our thanks to Ritika Wadhwa, chief operating officer of Cultural Intelligence Centre, and Rob Neil, director of Krystal Alliance.

Here's some of the biggest work challenges people say they're facing and how good employers and HR should be responding. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNC: Yes, it's our Look Ahead, my third here. Doesn't time fly? Time to consider just how 2023 might play out for employees and to get some hopefully useful thoughts on how we might best support each other through it all. Now, we hardly need reminding that 2022 brought us a perfect storm of global calamities and political missteps. It left us with a cost of living crisis, a recession, labour strikes, more Covid ill health. Quite a New Year hangover, but never fear, stone cold sober and joining me around the CIPD crystal ball, a varied trio. First, we have an award winning and influential chief people officer from Reward Gateway, new in the job there, it's Nebel Crowhurst. Hello.\nNebel Crowhurst: Hi, Nigel. Nice to be here.\nNC: From the home team, the CIPD's thoughtful Membership Director, David D'Souza, the kind of man who can rise above having his talk once described on a speaker feedback form as somewhat refreshing. It's always refreshing David D'Souza. Hello.\nDavid D'Souza: Hello.\nNC: And straight from the august pink pages of the Financial Times, it's the work and careers writer, Emma Jacobs. She recently wrote a piece about quiet quitting, which hopefully she won't be doing in the next half hour or so. Welcome, Emma.\nEmma Jacobs: Hi.\nNC: Now, Emma, employers, people who work for them, nobody knows how long this recession's going to last, how quickly inflation may abate, fuel prices fall back and all that but what we do know is that making a living and supporting the family just got a lot harder.\nEJ: It did. It is. It's interesting. Last year I studied a few of the companies that were doing the four day working week trial, and that started in June, which even then had a kind of feeling of optimism. And then as the year ended and the trial ended, everything seemed to change.\nNC: Yeah. I mean, I just wonder how you read the, the sort of mindset of, of workers at the moment going forward into 2023.\nEJ: Well, I think they're, they're worried. I mean, I think they're, I mean, financially, they're constrained. There's a lot of kind of unknowns, especially about hybrid working in the white collar working world and just uncertainty and not knowing what things will look like. I mean, we've moved very quickly from optimism to worries about how they're going to make money stretch in an inflationary environment and whether they'll get pay increases.\nNC: And quite a range of responses, Nebel Crowhurst, if one CIPD poll is any guide. I saw that more than 60% of people are worried about making ends meet. A similar proportion are worried about overwork and stress. And then there's other concerns which we'll get onto as well. So, it's kind of hard to tell what people are going to be feeling and how they're going to react as the year goes on.\nNCr: Certainly. It's going to be a very interesting year ahead, and we've, we've already had quite challenging previous few years. And so this just moves us forward into another, another space of, you know, what comes next and, and how, as organisations, do we support our people as best as we possibly can do, specifically around the cost of living? I certainly think there's, there's a, there's a couple of things we should be thinking about within businesses and within the people profession and, and how we support our people. And of course, you know, the cost of living crisis has a, a kind of practical impact. And what advice can we give to people? And what advice can we provide to our people in a business to know how to best manage their finances and how to make their, their money goes as, as far as it can do? But also that mental and emotional impact and the support that we can give people through this period of time because --\nNC: I mean, I just wonder whether, is this the kind of support that people expect or would take from their employers because quite frankly, you can't wave a magic wand and make their personal finances or their health better.\nNCr: No, you can't wave a magic wand, but, but what we want to do is make sure our employees are as engaged in the work that they're doing. And if, and if we, as an employer, can support them in ways that enables them to have a clear mind on the work that they're doing rather than continuously being concerned about the stuff that's going on in, in personal lives from a financial point of view, I think that's something that definitely can make a difference. And there is no silver bullet. There isn't one solution that an employer can put in place to, to make everybody's problems go away but what we can do is put various things in place that perhaps appeal to different people across your business that can support them in, in the ways that they best need. And actually, I do think employees now do expect a certain amount of support from their employers, and I think we have a responsibility to put in place the best that we can, the context of the businesses that we work in and the types of employees that we have. And, and it will vary from organisation to organisation.\nNC: So, David, what sort of things do you think employers can and should be putting into place? I mean, are we talking about HR going into some kind of crisis mode, changing its priorities perhaps vis a vis looking after its people?\nDDS: Well, I think, in fairness, the profession is not going into a crisis mode because we only have to look at the past couple of years that we've had --\nEJ: Yeah, I was going to say.\nDDS: To, to see a couple of things, I think. One that the profession has responded admirably to the challenges that everyone has faced over the last couple of years. Secondly, that there's been a growing awareness of organisations, that it can't just compartmentalise how people are in working outside of work. So, if you went back ten or 15 years, the emotions you were supposed to feel inside work were probably limited to pride, excitement about the five year plan and being inspired by the CEO. I think we now recognise that people are feeling, if we look towards the next year, possibly uncertain, insecure, overwhelmed, fatigued, a whole range of things. So, you get into the questions. You say, what can the employee do? What can HR and people teams do? And I think it's understanding their limitations. I think it's fair to say that not every organisation will be able to respond in terms of financial changes. As you say, you, can't kind of, there isn't a magic wand, but what they can do is they can make sure that within the limits of the agency that they have that they are as supportive and caring and understanding as they can be. And that they provide as much stability for people as is possible within their model to allow people to feel that sense of security.\nNC: I wonder, Emma Jacobs, in covering the world of work, whether you've come across any examples of employers who have been able to provide extra support, particularly for people with financial worries.\nEJ: I mean, there's obviously, there is a magic bullet which is more money, but there's a kind of, HR has a frustration in that they don't control the pay budget. So, so, there is a kind of, I guess, that I've heard from HR leaders, that there's a feeling of impotency when it comes to how much they can do around pay directly in terms of increasing people's pay packets. I mean, I, I kind of started off quite sceptical about financial wellness because it seemed like another extension of the kind of soft wellness benefits that don't necessarily have any outcome, but, but having talked to people, I think that there is value in providing practical advice. People do get into financial messes that they feel are out of control. And if they, if they feel that their finances are out of control, they can't focus on their job. So, there's a kind of payoff for employers in that respect. And I mean, there are, there are benefits that people can give, interest free loans. They can do some sort of help with travel costs. It, it is difficult because you are kind of dancing around the subject, which is people want more money.\nNC: And Nobel Crowhurst, of course, we've had lots of strikes. The mood music from the public sector is, is very troublesome. I just wonder whether that feeds a, an unhappiness, a discontent about people's lack of buying power. I don't know. How do you deal with that as a chief people officer?\nNCr: Well, in the industries that I've worked in throughout my career, I've, I've not worked in a public sector or unionised organisations. So, you know, very much on the, on the private sector businesses and, and within those organisations, some of the things that Emma's just mentioned in terms of the portfolio of things that businesses can offer to help people's money go further and also provide them with practical support around their pay. I think we're in a very turbulent period of time with industrial action across the, across the country and I don't think that's going away anytime soon. And perhaps there's something to be said there that as part of those negotiations, yes, of course, it is about pay, but it is also about the, the overall package. It's what comes with pay. It's not just the pound, pounds for the hours that you work, but it's everything else that an organisation offers. It's very much about, you know, terms of employment and, and the support that people get and the environment in, in which people work in that we should be looking at more holistically. And I think that goes across all sectors. People, of course, want to be paid fairly and feel valued for the work that they do, but they can feel valued for the work that they do through a variety of different ways in which the partnership between the employer and the employee can be, can be built up.\nNC: And, David, have you any thoughts about how good organisations engender that kind of approach? I mean, clearly, you need to be having more grown up and more frequent conversations with people about how they're feeling and how they're managing.\nDDS: Yeah, I, I think it's important to recognise that we can't just divide organisations into good and bad dependent on what they can do because they have different resources and different capabilities. So, there's a, you know, some organisations, as we face into next year, will doubtless have to make structural changes to their workforces, which see people losing their jobs. I don't think it's helpful to demonise those organisations in the same ways that some organisations will be able to pay more to their people and ease some of that pain. And others will not be able to do that without really putting kind of pain into their business model or their budget. So, I, I think getting clear on I guess the three kind of areas that, that people can have challenges is useful. So, one is their finances outside of work. Secondly would be their kind of, their overall wellbeing, how they feel about the world and, and the third one would be the things that are directly within the organisation's control, which might be the calibre of the management that are offered, that's offered to people, the development that's offered to people or pay. And I think organisations working out to what extent they want to be influencing and supporting in those different areas, but also acknowledging the limitations is the key to that. What I wouldn't want anyone from a profession listening to this is to think that if they can't solve all of these problems fully that somehow are failing. Most organisations are facing into a series of tradeoffs, and they're trying to do what they can do. Making sure that you are thinking about what you can do, where you can make a difference is really important. So, you might not be able to offer upper quartile wages, but you might be able to offer upper quartile support. You might be able to offer upper quartile listening capability within your management population for when people have problems. So, I think there's just, I just kind of want to insert that into the conversation because I think it's really important. If you are listening to this, or you're looking at good practice guides and you're thinking, this won't work here, it's important to recognise that there are many organisations that'll be the case for as well.\nNC: I'd like to pick up about the risk of people losing their jobs during this coming year because this is happening at the same time as we still have a pretty tight labour market. We know there's a labour shortage. I think it's something like half a million fewer people in the workforce since the pandemic. And of course, this wasn't how we were always taught economics. I mean, when you had a recession, you had loads more jobs suddenly become available. I just wonder if you have any thoughts about how this might play out in a year when of course we, we don't know how long the recession will last, how deep it will be.\nDDS: I think this is really interesting to discuss. I think the, the key in a time like this for so much instability is to go, what things can we reasonably anticipate? So, I think it's utterly unfair to go, what, could you give me the week the recession will finish? But equally, to say that we're, we're, we're going to have some really challenging times financially, and it'll probably last for a sustained period, we're going to have some people lose their jobs and their livelihoods within this, so how are we going to support societally? How are organisations going to take care of them as they go through it? We'll have some people who don't lose their jobs, but feel incredibly stressed by things outside, outside of work, what can we do there? I think again, it's understanding the limitations of what you can do, but also going, we have agency over a number of things as an organisation, how can we make that happen? So, there will probably be, and no one wants to hear this, at least three or four more crises that gets chucked into the next year because that's the one thing we can never anticipate is what are the other things that will happen for this or an intersection between some of the problems that we've already had and resurgence of COVID? All of those things. Organisations need to be, I hate to use the word agile because it's, you know, slightly sound bity but they need to be ready to respond, but they also need to be anticipating some of those things and working as well as they can how well they'll respond. Now, the good news, I'll come back to it, is that we've had two plus years of crises and organisations have built those muscles to go, we've got a problem, how are we going to respond to it? We've got a problem, let's experiment with a response to it and see if that works and if not, we'll change track. We need to carry that skill and that attitude and those capabilities into what will be another uncertain year.\nNC: Now, in this uncertain year to come, Nebel Crowhurst, of course, one thing some people might do as a solution to their financial problems might be to seek a second job or some kind of side hustle to make ends meet. Is that something which HR needs to think about as to how it will be responding to that? Of course, people are working at home. We can talk a bit more about hybrid working in a minute and how that's playing out, but I mean, different things happen, don't they, during times like this?\nNCr: Yeah, that's a really interesting question and something that perhaps does need to be considered as we move into the next year or two. I think there's a dual responsibility. You know, if, if you're an employee who's, who's choosing to take on a, a second job, or as you say, a side hustle, you need to be mindful and cognisant of whether you are able to do a good job in, in both of those roles. You need to make sure that you are taking responsibility from a, from any kind of tax perspective, which is, you know, not the most fun subject, but something that's important for people to be aware of. And if in organisations we're starting to see more and more of that happening, we also need to be making sure that both points stand, you know, are, are, are people able to deliver in their role for the, for the organisation that an individual's working for and is there any additional advice that we can be giving to people so that they make sure that they aren't in a position where they've got issues from a, from a tax point of view? It's a difficult one to necessarily be able to support as an employer if an employee, you know, is, is working in different organisations to what you know, your, you're supporting, and you're responsible for. And there is also another, you know, fairly dull answer, but an important one, nonetheless. If, if there are employees listening to this thinking, OK, that's something I want to enter into is to check their employment contract because more often than not within employment contracts, there is terms in there about solely working for, for a singular employer.\nNC: Of course, another way of responding to events for many people, I mean, so far, Emma Jacobs, has been overworking, you know, to make a mark within an organisation to get on in your career. So, if people respond in that way going forward, I mean, there is a risk of more burnout here, isn't there, for people?\nEJ: Well, I think, I mean, as David talked about earlier, I mean, we have been in a kind of, I mean, permacrisis has been overused, but I mean, at least, you know, that, that people have been on the brink of feeling knackered by the whole pandemic. And then homeworking and then back and forth and what, you know, and, and business changes and reaction to the crisis, crises. And so, even just the kind of dealing with so much change and upheaval and different priorities and kind of juggling different types of work. And, and also in the pandemic, there were people doing homeschooling and there was, you know, there were all kinds of demands placed on people and then people covering other people's work. So, you know, whether we've caught up, even with that. I mean, this, there is a kind of worry that people are just burnt out by so much permanent crisis, let alone overwork. I mean, overwork is one response to anxiety and feeling nervous about losing your job and having to do more with less and, and all the rest of it. But I mean, it is something that employers have been conscious of in the pandemic but I, my sense is, is that they're kind of less tolerant of employees' complaints as, as we kind of continue on. I mean, I think that, you know, during the pandemic, we had a big time of empathy and understanding. And, you know, people were worried about their relatives and homeschooling demands and so on. And then, you know, there's a certain patience that seems to have run out where some employers are kind of cracking down more, and I don't know how it will pan out.\nNC: I was wondering, David D'Souza, whether that might be one reason for something Emma Jacobs I know has written about very recently, which is another word of the year, which is quiet quitting, you know, this idea of, you know, in the face of all this, we've been hearing from Emma, just, just working to contract and, and not doing anymore. It may be harder for an organisation worried about it, dealing with lower productivity to deal with when an employee is working partly or wholly at home.\nDDS: I could talk for hours about quiet quitting.\nEJ: Me too.\nDDS: No, it's, it's interesting but I, I, I think there's a few things. There are some areas and ways of working where it's definitely higher, harder to measure productivity output. So, if you are working in a factory and I need you to make a certain number of things a day, it's quite obvious, you know, what's happening within that space. It is harder in some knowledge work to do that. I think it is therefore easier to reduce the amount of effort and maybe that not get picked up as evident and obviously. I don't think that is a compelling argument to get people back in. I think we need to look at flexibility. We need to look at trust, but we also do need to look at being really good at measuring output and outcomes and setting clear expectations for people. I think the more interesting question is, how do you understand when people are tired? How do you understand when people are fatigued? How do you understand when people are less committed because that's at the heart of a good management relationship, and that's what you need to help people flourish and develop and get the best as an employer from people.\nIt's not, you know, how do you monitor them more? It's about how do you better understand and work together? And the profession has got an absolutely key role to play in that. It's got an absolutely key role to keep looking at the evidence for the pros and cons of working in different ways and work with leadership teams in different workplaces, different environments, because I know we always drift to work from home, but a lot of people, that's not an effort, you know, that's not an option for them anyway. And keep making sure that we're making informed choices that benefit ideally the employer and the employee for that kind of joint success and productivity in some really quite challenging times.\nAnd the other thing I'll just add to that is, HR professionals are people too, and they're, they're employees too. And it's been an incredibly tough couple of years. As a professional body, we launched a helpline and support services. And we've seen those used, and I'm glad they've been used, but they've been used more than I would like. The other thing that people need to do over the next couple of years if they work in the profession is look at that self-care piece as well because they've got all of the challenges that other people have, and they've got the challenge of looking after people in those situations too. And that is tiring and that is challenging. And that is relentless.\nNCr: I think from an overall wellbeing perspective, you know, all of the different things we've talked about already from a, we've got the financial piece, which actually, you know, really sits under the umbrella of wellbeing. And organisations will have, for many years, done the best that they can do, like David was saying before, within the, the realms of their budgets or resources to be able to put in place, you know, wellbeing programs or, or things to support people. I think, I think one of the things just to bear in mind that's really important is you can put in place as many things as you wish. If those things that you put in place are not what people in the organisation need or that don't resonate with them, or you don't fully communicate effectively about the things that are available to people, it kind of gets lost. So, I think there's definitely something to be thought about in terms of really helping people to see what's available to them. And there's a disconnect between HR teams and people, professionals thinking that we are doing a really great job at providing lots of different tools and support mechanisms for our people and our people not necessarily engaging with it. And we need to be asking ourselves why that is. Is it that we're providing the wrong things, that they're not necessarily things that people need, but we think we're doing a great job by, you know, like Emma was saying before, providing things like, you know, salary loans, those kinds of things. If that's not needed and people aren't engaging in it, then, then why are we doing it? But we can kind of give ourselves a, a pat on the back to say that we've done it in HR, or is it that we're simply not communicating effectively within the business, so people aren't aware of what's available to them? And I think that's part of what we should be considering when we're creating solutions around wellbeing as a whole, whether that's financial wellbeing, you know, general health, all of those types of things.\nAnd there's certainly evidence that supports that. You know, I, I'm, I feel very privileged to have joined an organisation that's got some great wellbeing initiatives already in place at, at Reward Gateway, which is, which is fantastic. But on top of that, you know, we do our own research in the industry and, you know, the, the, the recent employee engagement trends report that we've run definitely highlights this disconnect between what HR professionals think that we've delivered versus what employees are feeling like there is available to them.\nNC: I, I was mildly horrified to read that the big trend for the next year with rewards and all that is gamification. And the last thing I want to do is to play games with my employer, but perhaps I've got that wrong.\nDDS: I know Emma's kind of written brilliantly on it the past, but I think there's something to be said, and I think it's just been touched on there, around this isn't about how do you have a series of initiatives. This is about how do you really make a difference to people. So, if the problem that you have is that people are working for a boss who's an absolute arse, a mindfulness app is not going to solve that problem for you. If the problem that you have is that someone's job is fundamentally poorly designed and there aren't enough hours in the day, a helpline is not going to be the solution for them. So, it's making sure that at the core of your business, the job design, the expectations of people, the support that they have is absolutely solid in there, the fundamentals are really good, and then going, are there are other things we can do to help, rather than mistaking, as was described there, a kind of, a flurry of activity and things that hopefully will make things better for actually the core of solving the fact that people are feeling, as we said, probably quite insecure, quite tired, quite challenged, and in need of coming into workplaces where actually they can be at their best each day and flourish. And we've gone through a long period of people's careers at times stagnating or them being in positions where it's difficult to develop. People are starting to now look onward and upward because we've been in this position for quite a while now. And we've also got to look at how we develop people going forward. So, there's a bit around job design, a bit around learning and development and support, a bit around managerial support and all of those need to come to the floor in the next year for whatever the challenges are that we're facing into.\nNC: OK. And another big change, Emma Jacobs, for the coming year, flexible working. People will have the right to request this from day one. That's soon going to become law, but some people might feel, whereas they did before, that they wanted to reduce their hours, that maybe we're going to see a, a drop in requests for flexibility, for flexible working. Do you think it might, maybe more people might want to revert back to full time hours just because they have to?\nEJ: I mean, flexible working means all sorts of things in terms of, you know, place and our time of day that you work and, and how you kind of conduct your hours, you compress them. You know, there's all sorts of flexibility. So, so, I think to think of it as part time work would be wrong and also, I guess it's whether people feel confident about being able to ask. And I guess that the day one right to request it gives people more confidence to ask it. Whether they'll get it is another matter or whether they even want to ask it in that condition. I mean, I know that several people have spoken out about it. James Dyson came out on the first day I think that it was announced and said, you know, that people have gone too soft. I mean, James Dyson can still say no to flexible working. It doesn't mean that he has to go through with it. And so, I think that people will feel nervous if they feel that their job's on the line, that they, about demanding things that, that they think the employer won't want to give them. But I do think that there has been a change in the last two years about how we see flexibility. And I, I, I think that ongoing, there is tension between employer and employee as to how they interpret it and whether, whether that can be resolved, I think is one of the kind of the biggest issues going ahead. I mean, particularly, we'll come to it but particularly with hybrid working, I guess.\nNC: Clearly, Nebel Crowhurst, this is here to stay, and it's been playing out since the pandemic. Any thoughts on how organisations can just make that work better?\nNCr: Well, it's quite interesting. I'll just lead on from, from Emma's points there about the fact that flexibility means different things to different people. So, when you think about the context of the right to request from, from the first day of employment, I, you know, I, I see that in the bucket of formal flexible work requests, which are where you are, you know, essentially asking for a change in your terms of employment and, and your contract with the, with the business. Flexibility in general is much broader than that. And I do wonder whether those formal flexible work requests will start to decline somewhat because general flexibility and hybrid working means that people can adapt and fit their work commitments and life commitments in and around one another much more easily. So, I think that the landscape has changed quite considerably. And I think it's beneficial for both organisations and for individuals. If we can foster environments in which people are, you know, trusted, and you've got a real adult mindset, and you enable people to be responsible for getting their work done in a work pattern that works best for them, I think that's a far healthier way of working than, you know, having real cultures of presenteeism. Now, of course, that's not to say that's going to work brilliantly well for certain types of roles that are perhaps, you know, customer facing, front facing type roles and, and every organisation has got different types of workforces. But I do wonder whether there'll be a bit of a shift in those formal requests coming through to us because we are affording people much more autonomy in their day to day work.\nNC: OK. Now, as we sort of try and bring this to a close, I'd like to just get a sense from all of you about how you best continue work on opening up lines of communication with people, so you do understand some of these things that they're going to, and then produce the best response that you can. David?\nDDS: There's a range of ways organisations can communicate with people and there are systems that make that very easy, but it's never going to replace, I don't think, the one on one conversations that happen within organisations to understand what's really happening with people on a deep level. The other thing just touching on what we've discussed earlier is making sure that if you do have a great idea as to something that might help, maybe you want to, before you launch that, check that with the people that you're attempting to solve the problem for and go, we're thinking about doing this, is this the kind of thing that would really make a difference? And if organisations can be that nimble, they can listen hard, but they can also commit to some of the fundamentals that we spoke about and I have to say I'm delighted because we lobbied for on campaign for that right to ask on day one, that that's been passed in law. But thinking flexibly about job design as well as hours and some of the other component parts then organisations will be best placed to support people through the next year, but it's, it's listening, responding, checking, experimenting, going again, that will see us through it.\nNC: And Emma, if companies are not doing enough, if there's a sense that employees are unhappy and their needs aren't being met, any suggestions as to what you can do?\nEJ: I mean, I guess, the thing that I keep seeing from employers is a kind of lack of curiosity or kind of the worst employers, is the, is a lack of curiosity about why their employees are doing things like staying at home. I mean, hybrid working is, is proving to be a kind of area of tension between some employers who want their staff back more and employees who want to be at home more, but there's never a kind of enquiry into why they don't want to be at home, why they don't come into the office. The assumption is always that they don't want to commute or they don't, or they're lazy, or they just prefer to be at home doing yoga. And actually, you know, it might be that they don't feel there's any value in being in the office. You know, it might be great for the boss, you know, because they've got their clique of people and the people that feel a real need to be in and to show their face and want to kind of connect with other people will be coming into the office. But those people that feel excluded or there's no real value in them being there, there's no curiosity about how that could change. And I do, I do find that quite frustrating. And, and even to go onto the kind of side hustles and second jobs, it's certainly about more money, but it might be that their job isn't that satisfying and they're getting more reward and creativity or more kind of progress or autonomy, or kind of a chance to develop by doing something else and that their day job is actually not that satisfying. So, I just, I think to start kind of problems, to start looking at problems with a kind of curiosity, I guess, would be my biggest thing.\nNC: And finally, Nebel Crowhurst, how are you going to play conversations with your people in the next year?\nNCr: I think the points that David and Emma have made are really valid and I, and I guess to, to add to that, it's, it is very much about listening and two way conversation in the organisation. So, like we said before, just pushing things out to the business and, and expecting people to, to latch onto them is, is not going to work. So, there needs to be mechanisms to enable people to feel like they've got their voice, encourage people to speak up in your business and truly listen to what they're saying and take action upon that, to show to them that you're listening and that you are adapting to the ever changing business needs and employee needs that we have in our organisations.\nNC: Absolutely. Of course, keeping the workforce healthy both mentally and physically is surely from what we've heard from people today is going to be the key to combating labour shortages and raising productivity.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:30:15\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: The power of reflection. Is this the missing link in helping learners to be knowledgeable and skilful doers? Now it's disappointing all around when workplace learning goes in one ear and out the other, and what a waste of that training budget when people just don't seem to get how what they've been taught applies to them and their role. No wonder productivity stays the same. It seems pretty obvious that learning has to sink in and ferment before people will probably question and direct what they do in future. As educators first pointed out a century ago, we don't learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on it. So isn't it time to start building this essential, reflective practice into our learning? Joining us to point the way, Fiona McBride is a learning and development consultant who started her career in HR but found her passion was in management, learning, and development, and especially building managers' skills and personal styles. She's also a yoga teacher. Hi Fiona.\nFiona McBride: Hi.\nNC: Sue Murkin is Learning Delivery and Associate Lead here at the CIPD. In her time, she's worked for Richard Branson and Anita Roddick on government funded projects for disadvantaged youths and champions a coach approach to managing and leading. Welcome, Sue.\nSue Murkin: Good morning, Nigel.\nNC: And we have an organisational development change professional with over 20 years' experience, most recently in coaching and coach supervision. Clients of her own Fushia Blue consultancy have ranged from Scottish Ballet and Mazda to Penguin Random House. It's Julie Drybrough, Hello.\nJulie Drybrough: Good morning.\nNC: So Julie, should we just start with the obvious, really? Why should we spend valuable work time reflecting at all? Why does reflecting matter? In your experience, what's the evidence that it actually works?\nJD: So I think it speaks to the point you made in the intro about, we learn through, not just through experience, but we learn through reflecting on the experience. So for me, the power of inviting people to stop, think about what happened, think about what could be done differently, what worked, potentially, what didn't work, is an essential part of moving people forward. It's an essential part of getting people to try different things. It's an essential part of any change because it's that definition of madness is doing the same thing again and again, and expecting a different outcome. So for me, this is where the reflective part of practice is incredibly important. There is evidence out there that reflective practice does support and even if you just look at the really basic stuff, like Kolb's learning cycles, it's in there. You plan, do, think, check, all of that stuff. So I don't know any other way to do this other than have reflection as a key part of anything that I design. I work quite closely with Fiona, have done for a number of years and she and I talk about it often. It's like, what's the reflective point here? What's the time that we need to spend with learners?\nNC: Fiona, I was wondering myself before this podcast, if there's a modern malaise of not bothering to make time for reflection. If you think about politics, a lot of people's actions seem to be dictated by their world view rather than thinking about their experience and finding out about things.\nFM: Yeah, and I think there's something in this about there's, when there's a lot going on and when we're running to keep up with everything and we also get by sometimes being on autopilot that then that opportunity for reflection and pausing, taking a breath, thinking through what's just happened is really hard. Or we just miss that opportunity.\nNC: Absolutely, and Sue, I was also struck by something you said that people might confuse reflection with just fretting.\nSM: I think that there's two things here and I'm, and it ties into exactly what Julie and Fiona are saying. I think that art of just stopping and thinking about thinking is something that we need to readdress and re-educate ourselves on and the value of it. Just recently, when we were having ACE our annual conference, I was looking at some research by Kane who was saying that, actually, it's not change management we need. We actually deal with change really well, but it's the pace of change and I think that Fiona's right. We've gone on autopilot because the pace of how we're living, not just at work, but per se, is just so fast we, potentially, feel that we don't have the luxury to actually stop and think about our hearts and our minds' connection and what was I feeling when I was doing that? Or what was I thinking when I was doing that? And I think that what's happening is that to try and keep up with pace and what we're doing, we're fretting about stuff. Oh, I haven't done that. Or I didn't quite understand that or, oh, blimey, they're doing it like that and I'm not sure I am and we're fretting in the moment rather than actually just taking a breath, taking a step back.\nNC: Well, in a way that, the fretting is a pretty good indicator, isn't it, that something hasn't sunk in or that the, you've learnt something which is disturbing or doesn't match with what you are expecting? Julie?\nJD: Yeah, I want to come back to that because, quite often, when we talk about reflection, the language moves into things like feeling, fretting. We're cogitating or, and in this part of the conversation, I think if we're talking about politics or main discourse or modern malaise, as you're talking about Nigel, it's often that the information that's in front of us is we, we're not getting the opportunity to see the broader picture. So we're plugged into social media channels and algorithms that often tell us what we already think. So unless you pause and reflect and think about your bubble, the information that you're you're working with, you'll just continue. You'll continue to think that way, you'll continue to read what you read, see what you see and I think we have a genuine challenge in our discourse, in our mental discourse and our social discourse about opening those things up, and for me, that's part of where reflective practice comes in because you can stop and begin to evaluate whether the information that you're continually getting is the only picture or whether there may be other pictures out there.\nNC: And one other thing, Fiona, I just wonder whether some people, in the light of what we said, especially maybe bosses, might feel reflection is for wimps. There's something a bit touchy feely about the word reflection, which makes people, which puts people off. Maybe they might think it's a luxury for thinkers.\nFM: Where do I go with that?\nJD: We'd hate to be seen as wimps, Nigel. We want to respond to the question.\nFM: So like many things that we do in our world, there are people that are fully on board and there are people that struggle to connect with it. I think when it's used well, when it's considered, when it's used as a tool within your practice, it's very powerful. There's a real strength in pausing. Even if it's for a second before making that next decision or thinking how to go about that next piece of work, there's a real strength in being honest about your impact and what you're trying to do and if it's working.\nJD: So I think you're right. I think there, that sometimes is out there. The notion that the reflection is this, it's wimpy. It speaks to a narrative in learning about soft skills and things being pink and fluffy, and there's a whole school of thinking, a narrative that sits around that type of work and how that's seen in practice. In my experience, it's actually the very opposite of that. It is much, much tougher to reflect on your own behaviour. It is much, much tougher to sit and work out what your impact has been. So you're intending to do something, but perhaps your impact has been different. For me, anyway, reflective practitioners are amongst the most resilient, the most pragmatic, the strongest because they have done the work. They have sat and been able to reflect on and look at things across the piece. So I always think it's a bit of a cop out. So if somebody decides to say what, it's a bit wimpy, it's a bit emotional. I'm like emotional is quite hard. That's why people don't like to do it, and to say, wimpy is a good way of not having to do it. So I love the dodge, but I'm not buying it.\nNC: So Sue Murkin, in our everyday lives, we do have an instinct for reflection, don't we? We think could I have done this better? How could I have handled that situation differently? And we know that in the professions, doctors and nurses, it's part of their practice, isn't it, to reflect and report on what's happened? But how universal is it in the workplace? You've got the big picture at CIPD. To what extent would you say reflection is built into our L&D at the moment?\nSM: Built in and undertaken, I think is two different things. So I would say that there is an absolute evidence and trend to build in reflection when you are building learning products, but is the work done? That would be the question I would ask and the reason I'm saying that is because I read all the feedback forms that come back from learners, regardless of them being through a company, product or a, our open courses and it's really sad how many people say, I'm not sure yet what I'm going to do with this, or I'm not sure how I'm going to implement this, and I sometimes could be screaming at those feedback forms because if there's a person or an organisation that has invested in a person to learn, actually, the responsibility, doesn't just lie with the learner. That manager should be talking to that person and saying, what resonated with you with that learning? What's the first thing you need to do? Actually, what was quite difficult for you to grasp? It shouldn't just be, I've invested in that person, they've done the learning. They should do the reflection, now I'm onto the next learning product or project.\nNC: Are you seriously saying that people fill in these forms and then those conversations don't take place?\nSM: Well, I can't say they don't take place, but the very fact that people reflect in the feedback to say, I don't know what I'm going to do with this, rather than I need to speak to my manager next about this, indicates to me that there's still some way to go to support people reflecting in the workplace.\nFM: That resonates with me. When I think about clients that I support, it is that there's the real good intention. Isn't and there's that willingness to take something and do something differently, but it's about the environment enabling that or allowing for it.\nNC: Can you think of any specific examples, Fiona, of people, organisations where you've gone in and tried to help what's been going on here?\nFM: One example springs to mind, and I was doing quite a simple management development programme. So with a group of new newish managers that were starting out in their careers as managers and part of the programme was we were meeting for half days, like once a month. So we had like a half day, every month across six months, and I was asking questions like, before you go into one to ones or before you start your strategy conversations, what are you doing to prepare? And the constant comeback was, well, we just have to keep, we just take the message. We just, we have to get on with it. We have to just move forward with it and I'm like, well, OK. So how do you sense, make sense of it for yourselves before you take that out into your space with your teams or the people that are waiting to hear from you? And there was a bit of oh, yeah, and people stumbled and got a bit stuck with it, which was really interesting. So rather than try and show or bring in some, I don't know, crazy massive reflection model or some, huge, extensive, reflective practice idea, we talked about what if you had two minutes? What if actually, before you had that next conversation, you stopped for two minutes and you just thought, how is this landing with me and what is important for me to discuss next? And so even just that one, two minute of reflective practice is better than none, I would argue, and then throughout the programme we then actually built that up. So in the end, I had them, or they wanted to, going out and about for half an hour walks with each other, reflecting and sharing and problem solving and thinking things through. But it took time to build, you know?\nSM: Can I just piggyback on that Nigel? Because Fiona's so right and I watch a lot of the virtual classrooms that we run at CIPD and I would say it's almost like a silent game of dare. So we talked about building reflection into the actual learning environment. It's the time when the facilitator will ask that question of whatever the question is, where someone would need to reflect and it just goes into that horrible deadly, tumbleweed moment, almost like, who's going to be the first to speak? Almost like, oh my goodness, who can't cope with the silence enough? And it's, and it they're all fine if it's about talking about a model or talking about something else, but as soon as it's, but how will you do this as a manager? Or what would you need? It goes really silent. I can see Julie's really nodding away though as well.\nJD: Well, I'm nodding, but I'm also the, I'm having a response because the silence, you can't interpret what's happening in that silence.\nSM: That's true. Quite often that silence is people are going actually, yes, that question is a good question. So, I work as a coach. I work with a lot of people. We need to get comfortable with that silence. We need to be able to say to people, take three minutes or two minutes. What I do in pretty much everything, management leadership courses. We'll ask the question and then I use writing because obviously that's a big part of my own practice. Take a pen, take a piece of paper, take two minutes and just write to yourself for a couple of minutes until you find your words, until you find what the, those thoughts. That silence, I think a lot of facilitators get very nervous about that silence.\nSM: Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.\nJD: And particularly online because it's weird online, it's this Zoom doom. So a lot of what we've done in the last couple of years, and again, Fi, and I have worked a number of times in the last few years, is we help people fill the silence, but with writing or drawing or whatever. They're doing their own work. They're doing their own reflection because otherwise they're filling up the noise for us and I don't mind what you've learned. I'm very hopeful that I've designed it well enough and I've put enough good models in front of you that it's relevant and you're going to take something forward, but I can't predict how you're going to use it particularly, or who in your team is going to benefit because you've had a light bulb moment. So I'm, I absolutely hear you Sue and I'm like, enjoy the silence. Just encourage that discomfort in the moment because that's where the learning's happening and our facilitators should revel in that silence. They should be, oh, this is really good. I've asked a good question.\nNC: But I think you're both agreed you have to bring the group or the individual to that point and what happens next is, is going to be, hopefully, useful, whatever happens.\nJD: You hope so. If you design it well enough then yeah, for sure.\nFM: There's a lovely quote that, I read a couple of years ago and now I just write everywhere and have in every notebook from Rumi, which says in silence there is eloquence. Stop weaving and see how the pattern improves, and there's so much in that for me, it's everything that Julie just said. You've probably got a decent quote from Julie anyway, but that's, it's that, isn't it? It's that, just see what's there. See what comes up.\nNC: We talked a lot about the process of reflection. I just wonder if we can get anything from any of you a bit more on the practical thing of what you do as an L&D professional or just a manager trying to improve the uptake of knowledge from training.\nSM: In a lot of our self directed learning. So, it's in the moment, any time, any place, anywhere where you want it, it's digital. We tend to use the three what's. So, what? So what? Now what? You've just got to really keep it simple.\nFM: I did some writing for one of the essential insights modules and we had this lovely summary chapter at the end of the module, but I then, reading it through when it was almost done, like, why are we asking questions at the very end? Why aren't we peppering them through? So at the end of every section, there was one or two or three very simple, what do you currently do now? Or what are you thinking about this chapter? Or if you action things that we've talked about in this chapter, how are you doing it and how does it connect to what you're hearing? So just having those points throughout the module, rather than just in one place, and when Julie and I design together, we tend to, and Jules, I know you'll come in on this too, but we tend to do reflection at the very beginning and then we pepper it throughout in different ways and then we of course have an end piece as well.\nJD: Yeah, so it's, pre questions at the start of the session, what do you want out of this? What's brought you here today? Even if your manager sent you on the course, you, you've been told you need to, what would be a good use of your time? How, what can you get out of this? So that's like pre reflective stuff.\nNC: Do you think we are in danger of underestimating how boosting reflection levels in an organisation might require humility on the part of the trainer or the manager? If they're the official distributor of knowledge, if you like. They run the training, they believe themselves right all the time about how things are taught and how things are done.\nJD: I think there's an art, Nigel. I think when you first start out and you're training and you're facilitating, you're quite nervous. You're a bit like you want everyone to have a really good time. You want everyone to learn and you hold a lot of the responsibility yourself. I think the more experienced you get, the more able you are to trust your learners and to trust that they will do good things if you've got the right design and you've pulled the right stuff in for them. Do I think we underestimate it? No, I don't. I don't think it's underestimated. I, for me, it was interesting because I was thinking about this before we came onto this podcast and part of me goes, it just, we just did it, don't we? When I was, when I first started out, it was one of the things I was taught as a trainer.\nNC: Well, Sue's implied that doesn't always work or at least the information is there that they don't know how they're going to use it.\nJD: Yeah, it's a really tricky one because the other thing is what I find is they think they're answering an exam question. So a good way to get people to tell you what they actually think is say to them, this is not an exam question. You can't get it right. I need to know what you think, not what you think you should think, and that is often a moment with hope where it changes what they'll tell you. Because if you say, what are you going to learn? Many people will go, gosh, I've got to come up with a really good answer and it's, if you can give some freedom and let them go, and the other thing is genuinely, if 40 folk have not learned what you, as the facilitator or trainer wanted them to learn, you have to reflect on that. You need to take that away and do your own work on what's, what are you spending your time on? So I think, without getting too deep into the warp and the weft of it, I think it is important. It is significant and I do think it's appreciated within the Learning and Development and the OD community that it's an essential skill. It's an essential piece.\nNC: And at the same time, I wondered if there are barriers that we haven't talked about for people to share their reflections. I was thinking, for example, about learners who might think it's not in their own interest to reveal their true fears or their deficiencies.\nJD: To my point before, people can feel performance pressure, so telling them it's not an exam question. There can be trust issues. I think sometimes we have different spaces for different types of reflection. So the reflection that you do at the end of a course might be different from the reflection that you would do with a coach, might be different from the reflection that you do with your team, might be different from the reflection that you do with, at the end of a project. Or, if you, if you're doing a postmortem of something that's not gone terribly well. So barriers are around maybe trust and permission and time. Time's a barrier, for sure.\nFM: I think as well, I'd add to that around just the ability to be reflective, a lot of people find tricky, maybe because they haven't had, they don't get the opportunity to do it very often. Or they're not even sure where to begin or if there's a right way, like going back to the exam point that Julie mentioned. So actually designing in and being quite smart as a facilitator or a trainer, ways that really help people to be reflective without even maybe making it a big deal. Let's all be reflective now for the next half an hour could probably, yeah, freak people out. So there's some lovely techniques and tools that are out there. There's the Liberating Structures facilitation techniques and there's one called 1-2-4-All. So you start out by asking a question and you give everybody a minute to think on their own, and maybe you provide them with a post it note and a pen, or, say, grab a bit of paper and just brain dump where you are at with X. And then you turn to the person next to you and you work in a two. So you work in a pair and then two pairs come together after a couple of minutes and share their thinking and then you come back as one group, and it's a really nice way that people don't feel like they have to have all the answers or don't get too stuck in their own head because it's quite swiftly moving along. There's a pace to that thinking time, which often people find really helpful.\nNC: Sue Murkin, are we in danger of making this too complicated?\nSM: The more simple you make something, the easier it is to embrace. So if you make something complicated, by the very nature of that, people won't do it. So I'm probably, I'm absolutely reflecting on myself. It has to be simple because as soon as there's any element of, I don't get this, I won't do it.\nNC: So Julie, simplifying things without dodging the question?\nJD: Yeah, do that. I think Sue's absolutely right. I think keeping things incredibly simple benefits everybody. There's a lot of complexity in the world. There's a lot of noise out there and if we are trying to land learning in courses or we're trying to support behavioural change or a mindset shift, those are complicated processes. Synaptic changes and all of that stuff are complicated in the moment and so keeping the reflection simple helps. So I think anything, the classic one that I use is what went well? And what would you do differently? Look at things through an appreciative lens, sometimes. Make sure you're not always looking through a deficit lens of these are all the terrible things I did. What are the things that we can build on? And then, you've got a learner who feels enabled and responsible for their own development, which is what you want.\nFM: I do think this comes back to, though, about doing our own work first. So if we're talking to each other, learning professionals, facilitators, trainers, there's something in this for me about do your own reflective practice in some way, shape or form. Get comfortable with it and different ways of doing it and you'll notice what you find useful and if you're talking about it with other colleagues, with other people in your networks, hearing how other people do it and yeah, find that comfortable level with it and then build it in some way, little and often, I think there could be a huge impact in that for yourself and for your practice as a professional.\nJD: I just want to build on that as well, because Nigel I'm thinking about, we worked together with a client probably about eight years ago now and the, we were running a leadership program and it ran over about four or five months. There was different modules, there was different elements to it and the feedback that we got from the client was this is just not quite landing. People are going on it, they're having a very nice time, but we're not seeing anything off the back of it, particularly. We're not seeing any great change and one of the things that we did was we, we sat with a client and we reflected on what was in there. So we looked end to end at the design, the models, and what had happened over the years is different trainers had been involved in it. Different people had been delivered, delivering it and they put in their own little bits and we ended up, when you looked at it from end to end, there were something, I think, maybe 40 separate models.\nFM: I think it was 52. I don't know why 52 sticks in my head. I'm sorry, but it's like, it was a lot. It was a lot.\nJD: It was a lot, and so we sat with the client and said, well, would you be able to remember 52 models or 52 bits of information? And bear in mind, like some of those models were, oh, you've got to remember four Cs and three Ps and there's this here and the next thing. So within those 52, there was numbers and so this point about simplification --\nNC: And how many did you keep about a dozen?\nJD: Yeah, pretty much. We did a few things really deeply --\nNC: Yes.\nJD: And they got different results, right? So there's a big point in there about that stuff.\nNC: We're coming to the end of our time. Sue, resources available, CIPD, any just thoughts on how people can get started on reflecting better?\nSM: Yeah, and I think that you don't even have to rely on resources. I think the biggest resource is yourself and it's just being able to, what did I do well? What would I have done differently? We've been using that question in our one to ones with our team members as part of our one to one reviews and it's not about what did you do well and what did you do rubbish? It's what did you do well? Let's face it, some people do have that propensity to be really self-critical so they can see what they've done, potentially not very well, but they really can't see what they've done well. So I think that opening up that side as well is really important. So what went well, what might have you done differently? And, but what did you learn from that? Because let's face it, most of us learn from our absolute biggest mistakes, don't we? So yeah, it's, I think, don't look external, look internal.\nFM: I think, just building on Sue's point about looking in. So yeah, tapping into your emotions and how did I feel when it went well? Or if I wanted to do something differently, why? What did I feel? What was coming up for me in that? And so use yourself as a data point, as much as other data points that you'll have around you.\nJD: And I want to, I just want to nail home the wimp point from earlier and say that if we take Sue's example of, we learn from our biggest mistakes often, you have to be a strong person to be able to sit with your mistakes and learn from them. So reflective practice is not for wimps.\nSM: Yeah, well said, Julie.\nNC: Thank you very much to all three of our guests, that's Julie Drybrough, Fiona McBride and Sue Murkin. I should mention, we did do a past podcast quite recently on learning transfer, which touches on some of these issues. So people might like to listen back that CIPD podcast and there's also last month's eye opening edition on men's health if you didn't hear that. So please subscribe where you get your podcast so you don't miss out but until next time, when we expect to be talking about some of the big issues facing us all at work right now and how HR can respond or help with them.

Three-quarters of premature deaths from heart disease are among men, and they're twice as likely to die from drug or alcohol abuse. So how and why are working age men struggling? Is it something in the nature of our jobs or some dogged determination to man up rather than ask for help? Joining us to discover how to break the taboos and get men the support they deserve we welcome a senior former diversity equity and inclusion leader with HM Government. He's the founder and editor of the Music, Football, Fatherhood, social network MFF. He's Elliot Rae. Hello, Elliot.\nElliot Rae: Hi, Nigel. Thanks so much for having me.\nNC: Did I forget to mention QPR in your introduction?\nER: Yeah, that's important. That's an important part to mention.\nNC: We've the director of men's health services at Peppy, a health app that connects employees with health professionals. She's Helen Lake. Hello.\nHelen Lake: Hello. Delighted to be here.\nNC: And I've no idea which football team you support.\nHL: Well, you know, The Toon.\nNC: Yeah. The voice gives it all away, and back with us, the CIPD's own Learning Content Lead, Steve George. Hello.\nSteve George: Hello Nigel, and I'm very happy to be here, and it's Brighton and Hove Albion for me.\nNC: Excellent. Now, Steve, we'll start with you, set the scene for us, if you would. I mean, do we have a gender health gap? Do you think?\nSG: I think we do have gender health gap. There was research by Mind, that was carried out in 2017 that found that that one in three men attribute poor mental health to their work. Whereas women, on the other hand, in that research found that their job and problems outside of work were equal contributing factors.\nNC: And do you think the Covid style working we've been through has had some impact on how management understands how men are doing?\nSG: It's had an impact. I think in response to that particular question, I don't think it's limited just to men. Some of the research that's been carried out by CIPD has found that only 29% of respondents said managers are confident and competent to spot early warning signs of mental ill health, and I think that that's across the board.\nNC: Now, Elliot Rae, your professional work's bound up in this area, but from what I can tell it was very much shaped by kind of personal crisis when you became a father. So, kind of, what happened to you and what can we learn from how your employer responded?\nER: I was working at the, in the civil service at the time, working in Diversity and Inclusion and our journey into parenthood was joyous in parts but difficult in parts too. My daughter was born with an infection called group B strep, which for those that know is a very, and can be a very serious infection. So one in ten babies will pass away, around another one in ten will have a serious lifelong disability from the infection. So when my daughter was born, we didn't get the crying and the joy in the room, we got silence. She was grey, lifeless, not breathing. She needed to be resuscitated. My wife was also bleeding out and losing a lot of blood. So it was a really, for me personally, being a 31 year old man at the time, it was definitely the first time in my adult life feeling completely helpless and completely vulnerable. And we'd spent two weeks in hospital with my daughter in ICU, and there were lots of ups and downs in those two weeks. Some days we would get really good news. Other days we'd get really bad news, and towards the end of that, she developed a really big bump on her head and we had MRI scans and it was a very, very difficult time.\nAnd what happened to me personally, was leaving the hospital when we got the good news we could finally go home I had a couple of days at home, a weekend, and it was back into quite a busy senior job and my wife was at home, she was diagnosed with post-natal anxiety. We were struggling to leave the house on most days, we would go to A&E all the time just because we were so worried. And I went from being like, you know, very extroverted and confident to like crying on the train on the way home from work to being knackered but not being able to sleep. To just going over and over in my mind, trying to replay what had happened and eventually kind of by accident, I spoke to a health professional who diagnosed me with PTSD and I got support through that.\nNC: And what about your employer's response while you were having to take all this time off and clearly your mind wasn't on your work?\nER: So I would say that, you know, I had a supportive manager. I think I wasn't open about what, exactly what was going on. So no-one really knew at work. I think they could sense signs that things weren't OK and I wasn't myself. You know, I've really learnt that we can be quite good as humans at putting on a brave face and a mask and I think I was quite good at that, you know, going to work and pretending. Obviously were, there were things where people would look, in hindsight could look back and see, yeah, he wasn't quite there. But my employer, this is 2016, I think we weren't really talking about mental health as much. There wasn't real support there for anyone, let alone kind of new dads. So I'm glad to see now there are more conversations being had around these topics.\nNC: Well, Helen Lake, your clinical experiences in urology, the branch of medicine that focuses on, well, shall we just say that the bits at the root of many men's troubles. But before we get onto some of that, do you relate to what we've just heard there from Elliot?\nHL: Yes, I do. Absolutely. Elliot, thanks for sharing that. I think a lot of it as well, I'm not sure if you'll agree with this, but I think as the, as the bloke in the scenario, you were being strong for your partner, you had to be there for her. She was the mum. She had gone through the trauma physically, you're the observer and be strong for your baby daughter. So that would be the face you would be presenting, but actually away from that, that's when it kicked in. Would you identify with that?\nER: Yeah, definitely. That expectation, I guess, that I put on myself and that I think a lot of men have grown up with and society also puts on a lot of men to be the rock and be strong. And I, you know, I think that's fine. Like, I think there is some times where we do need to be strong and be the rock, but there are also times where we, you know, we do need support, we do need to have conversations, we do struggle as well. And there definitely needs to be spaces for men to be able to talk about the challenges.\nBut also, you know, helping men to overcome some of those ideas about masculinity that get in the way of us sharing. You know, the reason that I didn't speak to anyone apart from my wife, I shared bits of what I was going through with my wife, but I didn't talk to my parents or work colleagues or friends, and it was about that idea of like, I'm the kind of the jokey one. I'm always the one at the party that's the loud person, you know, I have a loud voice, I speak loudly, I'm extroverted. So for me to come out and say, you know, I couldn't get off the train the other day because I was in tears, or I was having, in work I was having an out of body experience and I couldn't talk when it came around to my time in the meeting, or, you know, I wouldn't have done that then. Now I've grown and I'm more secure in myself and happy to do that and I do it all the time now, but you know, six years ago I just wasn't in that place personally where that was something that I could do myself.\nNC: So let's think a bit then about how understanding this kind of silent pressure men feel to keep it together and not seek help can kind of get in the way of helping people when they do have health problems. I mean, Steve George, would you say this factor we've just been hearing about from both Helen and Elliot is important in how you try and improve how your organisation helps its men?\nSG: It is, it's really important, and thank you earlier for sharing that. It's interesting hearing you say about not talking about it, which is my own personal experience as well. And I think that's one of the ways that we can look at the resources that organisations can put in to help men. So it's not just creating the permission and the role modelling to, to enable and facilitate that kind of talking, those conversations. It's also signposting the resources to people who may not be comfortable having those conversations with colleagues perhaps.\nNC: Because Steve, essentially what you've got here is people being expected or asked to talk to managers who represent the organisation that they blame probably for the issues they're facing. I mean, so how do you change that, that whole sort of atmosphere?\nSG: I mean, it's an enormous cultural piece I think which perhaps Helen is better placed to answer some of that than myself. But I think certainly organisations have responsibility to make sure that there are resources in place. Lots of organisations will have things like Employee Assistance Programs. So telephone lines that that employees can call anonymously, I think making it clear what access to support people have, the fact that it's OK and even expected to use those resources is an important part of that journey. And I think as well, having some of those people in management positions, in those senior positions talking as openly as Elliot just has as well is really supportive in helping those conversations take place.\nNC: So Helen, talking about men with physical health problems perhaps as well as mental related ones. How do you open up that conversation? I mean, how do you actually find what help men need?\nHL: Yeah, it's extremely difficult because, you know, historically if you look at the health service, it's not really set up for men at all. It's built around women and families and the money doesn't, there's no money in it if you like to run a men's health clinic and there's less touch points over the years for men to go and, you know, get that into that way of describing how they feel or even to have a health check or to report a symptom or just to run something past. So by the time there is a problem and I suppose biology wise men, you know, after adolescence, you, not much happens, if you like, physically. But then when there is a problem they have no idea often where to start and the prevention mindset isn't there and I think that, you know, I think that's a really interesting point, Steve, that research has shown that a lot of people don't know what resources are there in the organisation. There might well be mental health counsellors, off-site, online stuff, but unless they know about it, or it's easily accessible. So I think that's sort of the first thing.\nThe other thing is the messaging around health, I feel, and I think increasingly evidentially is that the messaging needs to be specific to gender. You know, the government has just rightly appointed a Women's Health Strategy in its recognition that there's certain messages need to be for women. In the same way, it really, really has to be for men because they first of all they don't often recognise the signs or if they do they, it's almost like a, you know, fear of disclosure, fear of weakness. They don't want to take time off. They don't want to let the side down. You know, that deeply embedded feeling again, and they don't want to harm their career prospects. You know, it's just a question of thinking about what are the main issues, what, what's killing our men? You know, suicide is, mental health is, but also cardiovascular disease, cancers, prostate, bowel, lung. This is where we need to start targeting.\nNC: OK. So Elliot Rae, from the work you do, both with managers and with individuals on your forums just give us some idea as to how you might be able to target people to get some of this information over to them about how there is help available and they don't need to suffer.\nER: So I think what Helen said there in terms of really making communications and services specific to the people you're trying to target, you know, is so key, so important. I know the Samaritans did some research about engaging men in health services, and one of the top things that they identified was that the language and the content really needs to be specific so men know that they're going to go along to this session or engage in this service and they're going to, their requirements are going to be met. They're going to be talking about things that are important to them.\nSo when, if I'm working with an organisation or I'm doing something through Music, Football, Fatherhood, I'm very clear in everything that we do our messaging to make sure that it is for men. Sometimes it's a space where everyone is welcome. Sometimes it's a men's space and letting people know what we're going to discuss and how we're going to discuss it and really naming those things I think upfront is very important. But I think there's something in terms of the science and art behind facilitation and creating safe spaces and having really vulnerable conversations. And I've had to learn this over my journey over the last few years and there's two people in my life that I would credit for helping me, a guy called Alec and a guy called Nick.\nSo Alec, I met five years ago, I'd just launched Music, Football, Fatherhood. I wrote a piece in the media. He got in contact and said he wants to be involved, and I will never forget this. I was in my parents' house, in my old bedroom, the little bedroom I had, and Alec called me and said that he wants to get involved in Music, Football, Fatherhood because during the birth of his second son his wife passed away. And I remember in that conversation I wasn't ready, I didn't, I felt overwhelmed, I didn't feel equipped to have that conversation with him and getting to know him over the years, we're good friends now and the things I've learnt from him is that he wants me and others to listen to validate feelings, to acknowledge, to say thank you. Not to try and come up with a solution all the time, not to say it's going to be OK or it happened for a reason, but get good at listening and encouraging and asking the right questions. And so a few years later I met Nick, Nick Clitheroe on LinkedIn and he had a 10 year old son and he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he had two more months left to live. And I reached out to Nick on LinkedIn and said, do you want to come on our podcast and have a conversation about it? And so we spoke and I had one of the best conversations I've ever had in my whole life with Nick. But that was because I'd learnt from being friends with Alec how to have those conversations. And I think when it comes to us asking men to be more open, which we are doing and we should do, we also have to understand how to hold space for people and how to make sure that that conversation is going to be a good one for everyone and a productive one and one that we want to have again, and one that encourages people to share with us. So the work I do in organisations is all about that. It's all about how do we build deeper relationships? How do we have vulnerable conversations, and I think when it comes to men's mental and physical health and that barrier in terms of opening up and seeking help and support, for me, that's at the core of it all.\nNC: Steve George, these are not the sort of obvious conversations for line managers to have with people on the payroll. I just wondered from your own personal experience and then the training you've subsequently done, how you've kind of evolved your thinking, if you like, about how you help people in this way?\nSG: I think what Elliot said around being a good listener and not feeling like you have to solve everything, I think sometimes as a line manager it can be easy to jump to finding a solution if someone comes to you with a challenge and sometimes even being explicit and saying, do, would you like me to listen, would you like me to solve it, or is it something else? Can I help? There's the TV adverts that showed the asking how people are, then asking how they really are, so reading between the lines of what they say which is incredibly effective. You can ask people how they are and they can jump straight to a list of the tasks they're doing, which is always a sign that maybe you need to dive a bit deeper. I think in terms of training line managers it's also being aware that if we're managing five people, you're potentially carrying quite a strong burden for those people as well, people will confide in you and carrying that information is quite hard for line managers as well. So while we are saying we need to listen, we need to recognise what that requires on them as well. And there's also something quite big in making people less afraid of saying the wrong thing. So, and I think that can sometimes be a barrier to those conversations is people won't ask a question in case it's the wrong question or they say the wrong thing, fear of causing offence. So, again, just guidance on how to have those conversations and really be human led, not process led I think is the big thing for me. So see the human, not the process or the employee or the transactional side, but keep it personal.\nNC: And Helen, for managers who want to be really practical. I mean, is there any data that you could collect about how men are? I mean, I suppose absenteeism would be an obvious one if they're going to the doctor a lot or something.\nHL: Yes. I think you've flagged some interesting things, Steve, where you said that if you ask the question and suddenly they're immersed in a list of things, I think if you know, a person, if you know your team, you do notice that maybe they're not engaged as they have been in the past or they don't come to social events or suddenly they're pushing back on projects or they're just, you know, they're just getting on with it. I think sometimes they're, those are the signs. But yeah, I think it, I think it's, you know, it depends on your organisation and whether you've got team leads or, you always get on with somebody better than somebody else, you know, your team lead might not be the person you want to go to anyway. It might just be, everybody has their own people who they get on with. But I think just to take note and watch behaviour, sick time, you know, we've just had, looking at some figures for the construction industry, which I know is a different sort of, you know, proposition when you're looking at supporting your workforce, because they're out there, you know, is that 48% of construction workers are being out on with stress related. Now, you know, were they demonstrating anything before that? You know, a lot of the problems in the construction industry are sort of, you know, around culture and you know, worry about finances and working away from home and alcohol related. So I think there's a lot more can be done in those kind of industries.\nER: Helen, I, yeah, I think that's really true in terms of looking at the industries, construction. We know there are some deep problems in some areas in that particular industry and I think what you're saying around knowing your team and building relationships is at the key. I think there are a few things that we could look out for if we know people are going through particular life experiences. So we know when it comes to fatherhood, you know, new dads, one out of ten new dads would experience some symptoms of post-natal depression in their baby's first six months. We know that parental alienation can be a trigger for poor mental health, and bereavement, so if you know, someone in your team has lost someone close to them recently, that could be something to the out for, and looking at things like relationship breakdowns as well.\nSo there are certain things that if we get to know our team and we build a relationship we will find out if they're experiencing these life events. Not to say if they are, they're going to suffer from poor mental health, but they may be more likely to. And then a lot of the symptoms that Helen mentioned, you know, someone is overworking, or you see they are drinking more or that they're taking more risks, they're isolating themselves, you know, they can be symptoms. And I think it is up to all of us to educate our ourselves a little bit more about causes and symptoms, just so we can be aware of the people around us. You know, we know that one in eight men at any given time will be suffering from a common mental health problem, like depression, anxiety, OCD, and when we think about that, it's that one in eight that's that's a lot, that's potentially, you know, someone in your team, someone in your family, they are likely to be experiencing poor mental health right now. So the more we can be aware of the symptoms and potential causes, I think it's better for how we can build relationships and support people.\nNC: Well, that is such good advice Elliott, but it is quite difficult to tell, you say looking for the signs, I just picked this up online on LinkedIn, you know, how sometimes people bear their souls on LinkedIn and get comments from other people. This is a guy who was clearly suffering mental health issues. He says what he was feeling before the crisis, constantly on edge, there was good news in the company but I felt nothing. I was swearing at colleagues, micromanaging, constantly checking my phone, not really present at work or home. I had dark thoughts. Then there was the crisis. And he talks about how he was helped. But I mean, most of those symptoms might describe the average overstressed manager, Steve George?\nSG: Yeah, I think it's, just to pick up on what Helen said about absenteeism being one of the signs and then touch on what you've just read out Nigel and Elliot talking about behaviour at work as well. I think it's also to look at some of those things like presenteeism, so people coming in when they, when they are ill. So again, overworking through that or working when they're on holiday, these are all some of the indicators as well that we can keep an eye out for. I think when something becomes a consistent pattern of behaviour, as opposed to an anomalous piece of behaviour, and that's something, again that should be flagged as a concern. Again, to that example that, that you just read out Nigel, in my experience I think one of the things to keep an eye out for is a kind of steady in incremental decline. So the, I think there can sometimes be the sense, I'm talking about mental health that it's you reach a point where you can't go on, where you kind of hit a rock bottom, and it's not necessarily that's, that's where you get to. And it's that steadily incremental decline is something that we can all keep an eye out for, with our colleagues and managers can keep an eye out for as well.\nNC: Is an element of personal experience there Steve? Do I detect?\nSG: Yeah, I was, this was my pre-CIPD career. I was put on a project and specifically and explicitly because I was a man and therefore strong enough to deal with the challenging customer and very similar to many people's experience when I couldn't cope I didn't feel realise I was able to talk about it and because of my own thoughts about masculinity and the fact that I should be strong enough to deal with it. But that was very much that that incremental decline and me thinking, oh, it's not quite bad enough to seek help yet. It's not quite bad enough to seek help yet until you, I fell off a cliff.\nHL: Yeah, and I think this is also true of physical symptoms, in my experience as a clinician, these incremental changes that if they was stopped in the tracks area. So if men had more information about what the red flags are then it would be caught at a better time and it would stop the falling off the cliff. We need to put that fence up at the cliff and stop that happening physically and mentally.\nSG: I love that metaphor putting the fence up at the cliff. I think one of the ways that we can do that as organisations and as people really is that there are calendars of events. So, as we are recording this, Movember 's going on, for example. There's calendars of events throughout the year that we can make people aware of, and it just keeps that trickle effect of awareness of conversation of normalising talking about these things, which again, helps people find resources and just helps raise awareness without necessarily having to have very specifically targeted vulnerable conversations necessarily.\nNC: And Elliot Rae, give us a bit of a sense of how you have targeted men with events or programs? How do you actually hit the spot where people otherwise would not have thought about listening to a bit of health advice?\nER: So we always find some commonality. Men are very different. Just because we're both men doesn't mean we're going to have anything in common or want to, to go to the same event. So we do try to find some commonality. Obviously football is a big one. So we partner with lots of different clubs, we have an event with Arsenal at their stadium coming up at the end of November which is really amazing. We've worked with Queen's Park Rangers in Brentford. We've done events called Dad's Do Hair where we come together and learn how to do our children's hair, which is really interesting. On our online sessions we might theme them. So sessions around being a new dad, maybe around finances, you know, make it a topic so people can come along, they're coming for the community, but they're also coming along for the topic as well. I think there's also the understanding of a lot of male friendships and male relationships and how we interact with each other and there's this idea of kind of shoulder to shoulder and face to face. Although the research shows us that men are more likely to have kind of shoulder to shoulder relationships with their friends, which is, you know, we do something together, we do an activity, we go and watch a sport, we play pool, we do something. Whereas women are much more likely to do that, but also have the face to face, you know, sit down and have dinner and coffee together.\nSo when we're designing our events, we actually start with a shoulder to shoulder activity. So the Dads Do Hair was a perfect example. You know, we're all there trying to learn how to do a French plait and a braid. Some of us are good, some of us weren't so good, but you know, so we're learning and we're literally shoulder to shoulder and we're having a laugh and we're getting to know each other and it's really good. And after that, we sit down, we have a book reading, we do face to face activities, pair discussions, group discussions. So it's really just understanding the psychology of how a lot of men will kind of interact in the environment and how we kind of engineer that to make sure we create the conversation that we want.\nNC: And Helen, you sent me, before the podcast a picture of an event with a large number of guys in high vis.\nHL: Absolutely incredible.\nNC: Was this from the construction industry? Tell us about that?\nHL: Yeah. So sort of moving on from what Elliot is saying is striking the chord with men where they will come and listen and have that shoulder to shoulder and face to face. So there's a local charity in Durham which is actually reaching now more nationally called Man Health. And the guy who brought that into being runs these courses called Blokes, Brains, Brawn and Balls. So the messages are clear there. So what they talk about is mental health, how they feel in themselves and the killers of men. What the need to know, what the red flags are. Testicular cancer, there's been an increase in testicular cancer, 27% since the early 1990s, prostate cancer has now, has overtaken breast cancer as the most diagnosed cancer in this country. So it's massive. And then also it's the language, isn't it? So straight away, you know what you're signing up for, you're going to talk about those issues. And there was a room full of blokes in their high vis and they turned up in numbers.\nNC: And these were people who would've never heard a health message or even thought about their health for years.\nHL: Absolutely. Give men the opportunity and they will turn up, and as you say culturally not everybody's going to be interested in football, but I think we're talking about mushroom foraging the other day or whatever it is, you get men together and they will start talking.\nNC: Yeah, I've got that one down for the CIPD team.\nHL: Yeah.\nNC: Mushroom foraging. Yeah. Made a note of that.\nHL: But it's very powerful. You know, women are very good at organising themselves, you know, you've just got to look at Davina McCall with the, you know, the menopause and all of this. But, you know, men have issues with hormones as well. And, you know, men need, they need to be able to, you know, if you signpost and they get organised then things will happen. Look at what works and build on that.\nNC: Which is a good cue to go back to Steve George. Putting all this together, have you any thoughts about how you move forward in your organisation with a bit more understanding hopefully of how you can get a message to people?\nSG: I like Elliot's approach around the targeting men in the messaging. I think that's really important. I think what Helen was talking about around the raising awareness and creating those, those spaces for men to have those conversations and almost letting those conversations develop on organically. So you facilitate creating the space for it. I think as organisations, making sure that that managers are trained in how to have the conversations. But also as colleagues, we're aware of who our peers are and what they're going through and we're keeping an eye out as well and creating permission for those support networks.\nNC: In your experience, Steve is this best left to trained counsellors? Are many line managers able to have these conversations successfully?\nSG: I think from my perspective, I think everyone has a responsibility for it. I don't think we can say it's just a line manager' responsibility or an organisational responsibility. I think organisations are an extension of the society we want to live in, and if we want to live in a society that is compassionate and caring and emphasises health and men's health, and men's mental health, our organisations should reflect that. They shouldn't exist in a bubble which is distinct from society and distinct from community where the normal rules don't apply. So I think it is, is everyone's responsibility, and what organisations can do is create the permission for people to take on that responsibility and the space for it to happen.\nNC: So, Helen, what would you say are the best ways of getting these conversations going in organisations?\nHL: Yeah, I mean, it has to come from the top. I think that in your team, there's, there'll always be people who are better at it than others and I think sometimes where I've seen it really work is to send interested parties, shall we say, on an ambassador men's health link person course, the Men's Health Forum do a really good one. Man Health do one, the Manbassador program, and then they are then supported in that role because it's quite a responsibility, isn't it to take on facilitating other people's health. And these are great programs to allow you to be advocates and to know how to go about reaching the people you need to reach. But definitely, I think the important thing about the campaigns, national campaigns such as Movember, International Men's Day, is that you can, you know, utilise those dates in the calendar and start getting your messaging. I mean, an important thing that springs to mind for me is, you know, self-examination of your testicles. Now, you know, boys at school, do they get that? I'm not so sure, you know, they come into the workplace. They don't go to the doctors. What, who's telling them that this is important? Like once a month men should examine their testicles. And it's not just men in their twenties, men in their forties get testicular cancer, the rates have gone up. So almost to have a, you know, a reminder, you know, check your balls and keep repeating, repeat the messaging.\nNC: And what I'm getting from Helen there, Elliot, is that maybe in future one size health and well-being initiatives just aren't going to work. I mean, we do need to be gender specific for the men here.\nER: Yeah, we do. We do. I think we are getting to that point where a lot of organisations are realising that, I think it's a new conversation, you know, where I think we're at the start of something here. You know, I've been talking about fatherhood and mental health for a few years, but I would say Covid and the lockdown, and I think us all living differently, being in our houses with our families or on our own working from home, and also just being more vulnerable with conversations in general, around well-being. I think we are in a very interesting and exciting time now in terms of how we can develop this sector of support for men in organisations. So I'm kind of optimistic that the support is going to improve. I think that there is a long way to go though and I think that question around, you know, our managers equipped to have these conversations. I think Steve put it really well to say that the workplace is just a reflection of society and if we, us, you know, our family members, the people that we know, we are not having these conversations, it's hard to expect, you know, managers to be having those conversations because they are just normal people that exist in this world with us. So unless that we, as a society, are kind of getting better, and I'm talking about, you know, media, the health services, government policy, like when those things can improve and change and move with the times, we will see people being a bit more aware and a bit more able to address these issues with men\nNC: And talking of understanding people's situation earlier, your TV documentary, Becoming Dad, touches on some of these issues, it's being repeated, I think, is it on the 14 November, if you're listening, fairly soon after this podcast has come out or people can find it on the BBC iPlayer.\nER: Yes. So please check out the documentary. I think it's one of the first shows that really brings these issues into the mainstream. You know, I think the conversations have been happening a lot within academics for years and in pockets of interested people and advocates and people who had personal experiences. So the thing is, what this show is trying to do is really bring those issues to the mainstream. I think, I think what Steve was saying there in terms of just increasing awareness.\nNC: Thank you very much, indeed. Let me just thank Elliot Rae from MFF, Helen Lake from Peppy and the CIPD's own Steve George for giving us so much to think about and act on. The CIPD itself has a lot of well-being support and guidance to help people in the workplace from supporting mental health at work and employee financial wellbeing to managing drug and alcohol misuse, some of the things we've been talking about today and guidance on responding to suicide risk in the workplace. A quick mention of last month's four day week company case study, and if I may say so a really in depth discussion around how you make it work. We're getting lots of reposts for that, people finding that podcast very helpful. So dig in if you haven't heard that one yet. Next time making your learning and development count, we'll be exploring the need for reflection and reflective practice in L&D. But until then from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "Trials of a four-day week are currently under way around the world and it’s hoped the new model will improve employees’ work-life balance and help organisations recruit talented people. The attraction of working 80% of the time for 100% of pay are obvious, but there are major factors to consider before taking the plunge: will organisations be able to maintain productivity levels? Is there a danger that compressing work into four days will cause further work stress? And could part-time employees miss out on this new benefit?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests – Tom Gibby, co-founder and CMO of The Bot Platform, and Charlotte Lockhart, founder and managing director of 4 Day Week Global – as we question whether the four-day week is the solution to the changing 21st century world of work.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:37:41\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Four days work for five days pay, what's not to like? Well, how about the bit where you have to help everyone deliver 100% of their usual output in just 80% of the time. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNC: It was the way we suddenly found we had to work during the pandemic, which I guess stoked the clamour for a four day working week. Our yearning for a better quality of life had found a focus after a century, the five day working pioneered by Henry Ford was being challenged. But then came war in Ukraine, soaring energy costs and inflation chaos in the economic management of the UK and a lack of business confidence generally. So you might think, as I did, that this may not be the time to cut down the working week. But four day week trials are fully underway in several major countries. 70 UK companies are mid experiment from a local chippy to large financial firms, 3,000 staff in all. So how's it panning out with most workers probably already saying they're overstretched, how can you reorganise to allow a 20% reduction in working hours for the same money? Can we possibly square this circle? Well in a moment, a really interesting chat that I had earlier with a games development company right in the throes of this six month trial of four day working weeks, it's the so-called 100:80:100 model, that is 100% pay, for 80% of the time for 100% of the output. That coming later, but with me now, the cofounder of an employee experience tech provider who's on record is a bit of a sceptic of a one size fits all cut in working hours, he's The Bot Platform's Tom Gibby. Hello.\nTom Gibby: Hello. It's lovely to be here today.\nNC: And on behalf of the CIPD and I'm delighted to welcome to the podcast, the founder and MD of the four day week global campaign. She's a business advocate, an investor and a philanthropist with more than 25 years experience in numerous industries. It's Charlotte Lockhart. Hello.\nCharlotte Lockhart: Good morning or evening, or hello, whatever time you're listening to this podcast.\nNC: It's a bit earlier where you are than where we are.\nCL: It is\nNC: So Charlotte, here in the UK we may have what are claimed to be the longest working as in Europe, but 100% of the pay for 80% of the time, 100% percent of the output. This is a big leap into the unknown, especially now. So what's the point of this trial and what you hope that employers might do with its findings?\nCL: Well, it's quite interesting that you describe it as a bit of a leap into the unknown, because actually there have been a number of companies that have been doing it for quite some time. Even our own company, Perpetual Guardian, started doing it in, at the beginning of 2018. So what we're finding now is that and some research that we have underway is that there is true valid pathways to do this in the long term, so not just as a pilot trial. And why now? Because now, more than ever, we need our businesses to be as efficient and as productive as they possibly can. Economic times are tough, so is this not the time to be clear about what our productivity is and how we can improve it? And the reason why we give people time off is because that is the thing that gives something incentive to help you do it, it's a partnership between employees and employers.\nNC: OK, well we'll go a bit more into the detail in a moment, but this has to be an exchange for a commitment to maintain 100% productivity. And Tom, it's almost like a bit of a threat here isn't it, if you don't give us exactly the same output, then it's back to gruel and five days a week?\nTG: Well exactly and it's one of those things that maybe sounds lovely in theory, but when it gets to practice you start to question, are there going to be some secret, hidden sacrifices that I'm going to now have to make maybe, during those other four days where I really need to be, almost over productive for those four days to maybe make up for the fifth day that's being dropped out. That said, I think we can all agree, we all deserve a four day week, right? What's not to love about a four day week? It sounds great. Life has obviously been exhausting for the last few years, it was exhausting in our working life pre-pandemic. Technology's moved on to a point for many employees where work was already always on, but effectively where we are now, it's created this whole debate where people have, there's been a real shift in what people expect and want from work and their employers. A change in what people value, a move to a far healthier work life balance, a focus on mental and physical wellness. So it's totally natural actually that after so many shifts about where we work and how we work and the technology tools we're using to work, that the next part of the debate would be, well, when do we work?\nNC: OK. So Charlotte how do you reconcile this desire of smart employers to plug into people's aspirations, to give them more time, to be concerned about their wellbeing, which might be more time with their families and yet, if you concentrate the work, if you intensify it, the chances are that people are going to work longer hours on the days they are working and we may not be any better off?\nCL: I see, but we're all falling into the same trap when we're confusing busyness with productivity. So it's a large part of what we do when we are working with our businesses, is to get them to define what truly matters in the business to provide the outcome that the business is there for. And so we're not saying you necessarily jump into a four day week and that's us, we're a four day week company. We say run a pilot to find out how you can reduce work time, so how can you improve productivity and be able to reduce work time? And so therefore what you're doing is you're working in partnership with your employees, it's not an us and them and it's not a threat or anything. It is, if we can keep productivity at the same level, we want to find a way so that you can go home. It removes the threat, it removes the us and then because actually everyone is truly looking for something. So we're not necessarily saying that it will be every Friday off. One of the biggest criticisms of the four day week is, well I just can't close my office for a whole day. And it's like, well don't try. Actually find the way that you can reduce time in other ways. And let's face it, I'll give you a good story around what that is. In one of the organisations we have a father who comes in at 10 o'clock in the morning every day, having walked his daughter to school. Now giving him Fridays off is lovely, but he could only do this really special thing in his life once a week. But we, in this scenario, give him the opportunity to be something, now there aren't too many fathers listening today I imagine, that wouldn't have loved to have been that dad.\nNC: But you do call it the four day week campaign. And people have got a bit fixated on 80%, one day off.\nCL: Well this is why we developed the 100:80:100 principle, because then it helps you define time. So we call ourselves four day week because let's face it, that's what people understand and I do spend quite a lot of time saying, look, how about we just talk about a reduced hour work? How about we're talking about 32 hours? But what do I do with my employees who are working 50 or 60 hours? What do I do with my employees who are only working 20? 100:80:100 rule allows us to look at, what is the time that you are allocating to work now and how can we look to reduce that? I had one MD from a large company go, well look, I know on average my people work 53 hours, so I don't know how I would get down to 30 or 32. And I said, well how about you just try it out, try to get down to 40? So it's about acknowledging that the amount that we are working these days, isn't good for us. It's not good for our health, it's not good for our families, it's not good for our planet, it's not good for our businesses, it's actually not achieving anything. If you can get your business productivity done in less time, then why are you driving people in for more time? It's better for gender balance, because fathers are able, we've done so much to pull women up in the workforce, but we're not doing enough to let our men out.\nNC: Charlotte that's great. Let's, at this point, see how it's actually panning out at a real company. Charmaine Clavier St-John is Head of People at Hutch, a startup who are part of this four day week experiment. It's a game studio employing 140 people and I asked her what was the reaction when she told staff they were getting an extra day off a week for the next six months?\nCharmaine Clavier-St John: To be honest, we told the troops quite a way after we had started thinking about it. We were starting to think about people coming back post COVID, what the world of work meant to everyone and we, when we finally announced it, it was on, we were still remote, it was on an all staff call via video link. And it was quite an epic moment, if I'm honest, literally seeing hundreds of jaws dropping before your eyes and the chat light up with things like, this is the best thing ever, the company's amazing. So yeah, that was quite a, that was quite a moment after months of toing and froing, was it the right thing, should we doing it now, is it right for the business, will it work, will it not?\nNC: But did the staff have second thoughts when they realised that, I'm assuming as a business, you were expecting 100% of the work in 80% of the time? Most people say they're pretty stressed at work already, they're fully occupied. So how did you deal, presumably you'd already thought about how you were going to start dealing with that, but did people start to worry when they really thought about what it meant?\nCCJ: They really did. And even prior to announcing it to all staff, there were some questions at leadership level. We brought in the line managers before we announced to everyone else and they had some, some of those had some reservations too, as you say, I'm currently working all the hours God sends in a five day week, what if we're more stressed? Something that we hadn't anticipated at the time was a few members of staff, we've got 140 members of staff here at Hutch, but there were three or four that were quite against the idea of a four day week and we hadn't anticipated that at all.\nNC: So are they free to work the extra day?\nCCJ: So initially we thought it would be something that everyone would do. And what we said, we heard from them, they, it might be for mental health reasons, or they moved here from abroad, haven't got many family. So what we did was, we didn't make it mandatory, we said, look if you really wanted to work on that fifth day you could, we wouldn't make it mandatory. We were also thinking about ways that we could support them, would we allow them to come into the office on that day together, we currently work from home, but would they come in, would we look at volunteering options together as a team of them, so they could do that together? By the time we got to the trial and starting it in June, everybody, 100% of the staff signed up.\nNC: So what do you have in place to ensure that the end result for your company, the creativity, but the actual graft is done and that your productivity hasn't dropped with people there for 20% less time, whether physically in the office or at home?\nCCJ: That's the question that everyone wants to ask, right? How do you measure productivity? There, I think for every company it's different. We are part of the UK trials, so we have the support of Cambridge University and Boston College in the States carrying out research alongside us and surveying the teams and that kind of thing. But initially we wanted to make sure of course that there was rigour behind this, but we tried to measure too much. And I think that's been a key learning for us as going through this that, we had every single team, we have, as I said at the beginning, we set up a task force that's been brilliant, we've got reps from every team and they came back with what was realistic from their teams to be able to measure. So for example, of course the obvious things like revenues, sickness data, but we had other teams relevant to them coming back to us too, so things like the office team, number of tasks completed, the licensing team, licences pushed over the line and that kind of thing. But when it came to the measurements, it was proving to be counterproductive when we first did that first measurement dip, so we've scaled that right back. But we are tracking things as I say, wellbeing of course, burnout, number of hours worked, sickness data, turnover, sprint velocity is a key one for the type of business that we're in.\nNC: What's that?\nCCJ: So it's the number of, we produce mobile phone games and we work on a project basis that we have two week sprints and it's the number of points averaged out over those sprints that we complete, as part of deadlines and that.\nNC: OK. So what is your sense of how successful this has been so far, how likely you are to stay with it, whether everything is getting done that you would've done before with everybody working an extra day?\nCCJ: It hasn't been without which challenges, there have been moments, especially at the start where there was a real adjustment, we noticed that stress levels had gone up. We do a four weekly check in survey, just a few key questions and we noticed that people were saying they were working extra hours. That's starting to, well that has started to really scale back, so most people saying that they feel they are completing 100% of the work in 80% of the time. I've got lots of managers telling us how impressed they are with their teams. As part of the task force, we have people feeding back their challenges and wins every week, the challenges are becoming much less a case and the wins much more. Again, team leads, people telling us they feel more refreshed, more productive. Lots of things that we've implemented at team level and at company level to make this a success, so for example, there's been a quiet hour that's been implemented, because people were telling us it'd be helpful to have some deep work time or no meeting time. So we carried out a meeting audit across the whole business, every team was asked to track and to template what regular meetings occurred, what was the purpose, who attended how frequent, that kind of thing. So we've done a real program of scaling that back, so most meetings --\nNC: Didn't the process itself though, make people more efficient with meetings, because they were trying to use their time in a better way?\nCCJ: Quite possibly, we hardly have weekly meetings that run for an hour any more, they're often pushed now to biweekly, to 30 minutes. There's other things that are more practical, so for example as I said, people asked us for, they needed that deep work time or just to, we sit in an open plan office, so there's things like, we have a bar area upstairs which isn't used, it's used for social events or end of the month. But in the day it's a lovely space with lots of stools and couches and that kind of thing, it's not used in the day, so we've made that a quiet area a bit like a quiet carriage on a train. Things like the Pomodoro Technique, which none, not many of us had even heard of before the trial and it's a tool to help with productivity and break up your day into chunks that you can focus, so people are using that.\nNC: This is a physical platform people use?\nCCJ: Yeah it's a platform, so it's on our intranet but you can get them, it's quite widely available on different platforms and sites and apps, so people are using that. Different processes, so everyone's done a real job of looking at what they can do differently. For example, our engineers and the technical guys have decided that they aren't going to release updates the day before the weekend.\nNC: And people always have Friday off, is that how it works for you?\nCCJ: We originally thought Friday would be the day. Then just heard some rumours that a few people would prefer a Monday and we thought, you know what, we should probably ask. So we did. And it came back overwhelmingly that people wanted Friday off, I think it was something like 96% and the key reason was, they felt more productive at the beginning of the week. Second reason was that it would allow them more time to spend with family and friends.\nNC: Do you think you've boxed yourself into a corner now? Because it sounds to me, though there are questions about the productivity you kind of slightly weren't able to answer that directly, but people aren't going to want to go back, aren't you going to have to keep working four days now?\nCL: No, I don't think that's the case. We were, now our CEO was clear right from the start that we have to make this work. This is about making sure that we can maintain 100% productivity in 80% of the time, in order to get 100% of the pay. So we will be getting all of the data back from the universities in December, we'll be assessing that with our own data, but it was made clear to everyone, we've, everybody has signed into an opt in that sets out expectations about what's expected and as of 1 January, we will revert back to five days a week, unless we confirm otherwise. However, what I will say is it doesn't have to be all or nothing, but it might be that we decide, yes, it could be of course that we might need to go back to five days a week. So far that's not looking like it would be the case, but it's a possibility of course. But it could be that we come back four or five days a week for a short period and collectively we look at any other tools or processes or, that can be implemented or adjusted, to make this a success long term. It could be that we go to five days a week, but shorter days, or alternate Fridays. The key thing and some of it isn't even brain, it's not hugely scientific things that been adapted, but things like the meetings, we've spent a huge amount of time as I say, preparing for this at the start, months beforehand, looking at ways and tools and processes and things that we could be doing differently. So, even worst case we came back to five days a week we're, we've learnt so much, we're a much more productive business as a result.\nNC: This is all fascinating, I could talk for hours and ask you a lot more, just one more question. And that is that, what kind of functions within the organisations have been the most difficult to adapt? Because I was looking at, for example Wellcome, the pharma company, found it hard going for their finance, their IT, their HR teams found it very, very difficult, whereas maybe creatives in the game industry can adapt better.\nCL: To be honest I haven't heard of particular teams. There's particular individuals, who I think every company will have those individuals that will always work longer hours and I think whether you are five days a week or four days a week, those people will find things challenging, so that's something that we've been working, we've worked with people on. Speaking honestly, I was always a four day week before we entered the trial, I found moments where actually it's tricky for me, because I always had the luxury of a team that was working five days a week and I could quietly give them a couple of emails to help out on, or message them on a Friday. So there's been moments when I've had to go, I can't do that anymore, I need to be the role model, I shouldn't be working on a Friday you know? So I think for individuals, those die hard people that have always worked out, that's been, it's been challenging for them, but they've adjusted. We're all doing different things, we have a quiet hour in my team every Monday after we have our team catch up, to get on with work, I have other people in the analytics team that do different things, like they have a rule within their diaries, so that if you ever go over five hours of meeting time, meetings are removed into another day, so you always have at least two hours to get on with the work every day. So there's, people are adjusting and doing things differently. But what we're certainly not hearing is that balls are dropping, we're not meeting deadlines, or any real reason to think that, actually, we need to stop this. That's certainly not something that we're seeing at all.\nNC: Charmaine Clavier-St John, Head of People at Hutch Game Studio, well thank you to her. So Tom, let's pick up on something that she said there, about the fact that they were measuring too much, it became unwieldy when they started this experiment, they had to cut down. But I am guessing that, without a lot of data it is very hard to know if your four day week, or your 80 instead of 100 staff hours worked, is going to be viable long term.\nTG: Well yeah and I think that again, that's where the question comes down to, what are, what do we think the benefits of this will be and how do we measure that? And I think it was really interesting that she touched on things like, a possible reduction in areas of absenteeism that negatively impacts productivity. So areas like a reduction in sick days, maybe we could see that a reduction in staff stress or a reduction in burnout is beneficial to a company's bottom line and a company's general engagement of their workforce and all that kind of stuff. Even with things like, just taking this lens and Charlotte, I love what you were saying about almost how we're measuring productivity and it not just being about presenteeism, but it being about output. And I think even just thinking about, not even moving from a five day to a four day, but how could we work more efficiently? The Bot Platform is all about empowering people to build their own work tools, that allow them to work in more productive and efficient ways, but even something as basic as looking at, this recurring meeting we have, this one hour meeting, that 10 people are in every single week, that takes up 10 hours of time, does that need to be a meeting? Could this be biweekly, could it be done in a more async way where it's more of like a video that's posted and people drop comments on it, or it's a text based post, or something like that? So I think there was some really interesting things touched on in terms of the benefits, but the thing that really stands out for me is, how do people measure it? And I think until you can get to a really firm level of measuring outcomes and output, it's always going to feel a bit soft when people are trying to explain what the benefits are, the output, the outcome, also massively depends on the job, the role and the area of work that you're trying to measure.\nNC: So Charlotte, when companies start the experiment, what is in place that you put in there with your researchers and people monitoring, to actually work out whether companies are continuing to hit the spot and enabling people to have more time of their own?\nCL: Well so the interesting thing about measuring productivity in a business is, you're either doing it in your business already, or you're not. Now most businesses have some form of measuring how successful they are and so what is explained in that interview of course, is that they try to employ a whole pile of new measures, to see whether new measures were what suited their business to look at different things. Realistically what she's saying is they've kept a couple of the new measures, but on the whole they're just measuring what they measured before. So if those measures were sufficient before, is it necessary to have a whole another layer of measures if it doesn't suit the business to be bothered with measuring them? Now, but --\nNC: That's very interesting.\nCL: Yeah and so, so one of the things that people often say in this is, but how was that with the four day week? And I'm like, yeah, but how was it with the five day week? People say, the four day week doesn't suit everyone and I'm like, yeah, but the five day week doesn't suit everyone either. So actually it's interesting what we try and attribute to this change and actually removing what we're actually trying to achieve. I think Thomas is 100% right, often businesses aren't measuring things properly and they're not measuring them, they're not measuring the right things, but it's still always that business's decision as to whether they do that or not. And also further to what he was saying, what running an experiment does is, at its core, asks you to question everything that you're doing. The meetings thing, in the office space the meetings thing is the most incredible waste of time and we all know this, it's in every single time management book you could pull up from the airport bookstore.\nNC: And we heard examples of that in the case study, clearly. I just want to ask you Tom, what are the issues that are most likely to arise, if a company were to start this?\nTG: There's a few things I'll probably list off here. The answer to all of this as Charlotte says is, if people measure their output correctly, this becomes less of an issue. But you're totally right, there is hypothetically an issue of compressed hours and burnout that could happen, if I was previously doing five, eight hour days and now I'm doing four, am I expected to do four, ten hour days to make up the time? And while in organisations influenced by myself and Charlotte and many others, that might not be the case, I know for a fact there are many other work environments out there that might take more of a black and white approach to this. Then you have to think about, well what are those impacts? So let's take the father who walks his child to school every morning, take the father that takes his kid to football practise every Tuesday at 7.00pm and he used to be able to do that because he finished work at 6.00pm, but now he finishes work at 8.00pm because he gets Friday off. So I can see issues around that, I can definitely see issues around formalised reductions in vacation, or potentially even worse unformalised, like pressure, don't take the vacation, you get that time off with that extra day and surely a longer period of time off is much better for our recovering from burnout and all the rest of it, than just having one day here and there. But then I think the big thing for me then comes down to, which day are people off and who gets to choose? And Charlotte, I know you said at the beginning that it shouldn't be, we only work Monday to Thursday and then we're off on Friday and it should be maybe a bit more flexible, but there will have to be a point where there are --\nNC: Well it has to be if you're, if other companies want to call you, if you've got ongoing jobs.\nTG: Yeah.\nNC: You can't have an empty office, can you?\nTG: You're going to need to have some sort of, like these people work here, these people work there, but who's deciding that? And I think that kind of becomes an issue, all that's happening here is, the employer is still deciding which days we work, nothing's really changed culturally there, the employer's still saying you have to work these days. And then the final thing of course, is when different companies work with each other. So if you have an advertising agency and they work five days a week, but they're organising a TV shoot with a company that's on a four day policy, trying to arrange those calendars might be really difficult. If both are on four days and one works Monday to Thursday and one works Tuesday to Friday, that calendar syncing is going to be a nightmare. So I think unless you really formalise this, a lot of unexpected complications start to appear and I feel like the second you start to formalise it, it just becomes another employment law.\nNC: So Charlotte, how should HR and others best prepare and monitor and experiment? How do you try and anticipate some of these issues and set up an experiment that can be really useful, even if you don't fully go back to a four day week at the end?\nCL: Look, I think that all of these issues that Tom raises are the questions that you are looking to resolve in your experiments. So Nigel, you're 100% correct with how that is. So that's why you run a trial. When you do this it has to be right for the business, right for the customers and right for your people and so you are working towards that. Now, if you've got a company that has a poor corporate culture and the boss is used to just demanding stuff off their people, you are not the right sort of company to be trialing something like this. You've got different problems. The companies that make this a success, are the ones who work in a modern workforce, which acknowledges that the future of work in their business and in their industry, includes collaboration and it is a case of everyone working together. So Tom, to your point about the chap who comes in at 10 o'clock in the morning, so on that particular team, he comes in at 10 o'clock in the morning, his team leader leaves at 3 o'clock in the afternoon because he collects children from school. There is another chap who takes a whole day off work and there is another person in the organisation who takes two afternoons. And I said to them, my giddy aunt, how complicated is that? How do you, they said, look it was, it took a bit of getting used to, but at now broadly doesn't come up. So it's one of those things that's around, how you work together as a team, how you work collaboratively and what we find in companies that are culturally appropriate for something like this, it is the best team building exercise that you will ever do. And that was, even the experience we found at Perpetual Guardian, we're also one of those companies that's, that was a bit siloed, 240 people you're going to end up with silos and we had people going, oh I didn't even know she worked for our company and now I really understand what she does and her job role. And so it's about how they shared ideas as to how to reduce time, we had an internet that we used, so some of it's about the mechanisms that you use within that. And then back to the clients, very much it has to work for your clients too and that largely comes down to how you communicate with them and how you adjust the programme to meet their needs as well. Now sometimes, for example, I was on an interview with a lady the other day who said that they'd had a bit of a launch and so she'd had to come in, or be, have her phone on, on the Friday, they take Fridays off, because she needed to take calls. But she said, I would have needed to have done that on the five day week, I'd have taken calls on the Saturday. So it's about sometimes understanding what people do and don't do, that is normative in a work environment.\nTG: And the research definitely seems to imply that companies like it. That trial that's been going on in the UK, I think I saw it was more than, just under 3,500 workers across 73 companies, including banks, retailers, healthcare and hospitality, so a real breadth of different types of industries and different types of workers there. Now at the halfway point, I think they surveyed 41 of the 70 companies. 86% of them did agree that they would consider keeping the four day work week beyond the trial and 88% of them actually said the scheme is working well. And then when asked about productivity, nearly half of them said productivity had maintained around the same level, 34% said it improved slightly and 15% actually said it had improved significantly. So it would, I totally agree with you Charlotte that, start with the trial, see how it goes, ask your staff, ask management, ask stakeholders, see how it's going and then use that to improve. I suppose the thing is, if the issue is that workers and societies are feeling overworked, knackered, burnt out, is the four day working week the best solution, or actually should we, rather than going to that extreme, do we need to focus on some of the other things, like maximum hour contracts? Encouraging people to just take vacation and actually switch off when they're away. Embracing a generation of more empathetic and caring leaders and managers that make staff feel valued and appreciated, even allowing people to take vacation. It'll be fascinating to see what the results are of this pilot in the US, but there might be companies piloting it that only offer their staff 10 days holiday a year. An easy way to help them recharge is to increase the vacation. So I wonder if the four day working week actually ends up just slapping a plaster over the problem, without addressing the core issues that are causing us to feel overworked and burnt out.\nCL: It's a very valid point. So what we find though is that when people run the pilot, those are the things that they are looking at as well. We are not talking about reducing annual leave of any form, or statutory holidays of any form either. In fact, actually what Perpetual Guardian did, is it hasn't even changed employment contracts, people opt in to the, what they call the productivity policy and so they get their extra time off and they get their, because their employment contract actually hasn't changed. And that was an anomaly because of New Zealand labour legislation, which is probably a very similar thing in the UK. Tom you mentioned it's really important to set true productivity and out outcome measures for people, but actually what we say is with people.\nTG: Oh absolutely, yeah.\nCL: That's the difference. Yeah and I know that's not what you meant, but it is actually an important, it's an important difference that we're actually going, how do we, because if you come into a business and you say, right guys, I want us to be more productive or we want better outcomes out of this, generally all that people hear is, you want me to do more with less and redundancies are on the way. And you don't make it safe. But if you say, look guys, if we can be more productive, look I'm happy with how productive we are right now, but if we can be more productive, you can have time to spend on whatever you want to spend it on, whether it be all the things that we, that people spend time on. And so this becomes, it really focuses on being a partnership, how can we be more productive so you can have more time? It's not a threat, it's about working together so we can both achieve something. And that more time applies to the bosses too.\nNC: And Charlotte, this is a very beguiling picture of the workplace that you paint, but do we have to be careful what we wish for Tom? After an experiment some employers, I assume we are talking here about less enlightened ones, might just be tempted to cut everyone's hours and pay. These are hard financial times again now.\nTG: Yeah, it's convenient that just when we're talking about going into a recession and there's lots of talks about budgets being cut, that we're also maybe starting to talk about reducing hours, but promising people the pay will stay the same. Also worth noting, that totally applies to salaried workers, but there's a major media corporation in New York and they have a large number of hourly employees and they rely on overtime, so if they're told that their hours have to be capped at a certain amount, that will result in a salary cut for them. So, again, I think in certain types of companies, this totally makes sense, I think in others it could be a bit of a disaster and very complicated to roll out.\nNC: OK, we're coming to the end of our time now. But I just want to, if you could make just one point that draws this to a bit of a conclusion Charlotte.\nCL: From my perspective, realistically, what we're talking about is, how does a business work with its people to create the best business? And business leaders need to remember that they borrow their people from their lives.\nTG: There you go.\nNC: And you wouldn't disagree with that Tom?\nTG: No, no absolutely not. Your most important people are your staff. Businesses can't grow without an engaged, happy and productive workforce, so as much as we can do to encourage that the better. Well first of all, there's never going to be one singular model that works for everyone, every business is different. But ultimately, if we continue to judge productivity and this is where I think myself and Charlotte are completely aligned, if we continue to judge productivity based on presenteeism and time, rather than output and if we also on top of that, continue to just pass sweeping generalised laws, without understanding and appreciating how it will impact each and every business, even each department within a business, then we're not really improving work for the people who matter most.\nNC: Well it's been an excellent discussion.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:24:22\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Learning off the job. How to tap skills and experiences gained from hobbies, sport and life itself. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNC: Now with financial and daily work pressures piling up like never before, this might not seem the time to focus on what people do in their own time outside work. But just think if like me, you often find yourself watching YouTube tutorials to find out how to do something around the home, you're already a devotee of just in time learning without even realising it. So whether it's volunteering, running, boating, learning a language, all these and more sharpen our skills and give us some self knowledge, but they might also be life lessons that are going to waste across the workforce. So this podcast is all about the value of this so called adjacent learning and how it can best be tapped by learning professionals to improve individual and business performance. Alongside me, Carol Bower, Head of Learning at BAD, that's BestAtDigital, with 20 plus years of experience in using learning to unlock potential and change behaviour. Hello.\nCarol Bower: Hello.\nNC: And the CIPD's own Learning Content Lead, Steve George, co-author of a soon to be published book on adjacent learning. He's clocked up experience working on digital learning with a string of successful global brands. Hi, Steve.\nSteve George: Hi Nigel.\nNC: So I'll start with you, Steve. Let's be clear on what we mean by adjacent learning and what kind of help it might be to organisations, as well as how it enriches the individuals who are doing it.\nSG: Sure. Yeah, so in the book we define adjacent learning as the way that we work with and learn from other professions. So that's professions outside our work, as learning and development professionals. In its simplest form we quite often hear people in learning and development talk about how we can learn from marketing and how they communicate with influence. And that's an absolutely certain fantastic place to start, because why reinvent the wheel when marketing are doing it so well. But it's also possible to go deeper. So what works within marketing might not work every time within the context of learning. So then you look at those adjacent communities, not just as marketing, but where marketing got their information from, where they learn from, what their evidence base is and I know Carol's got lots, so she can come in on that as well.\nCB: So for me, I always define it personally, that's because learning is personal, we do things for our own reasons, we don't do things for the reason of others, so it really doesn't matter how much learning we experience. Ultimately we make our own decisions around whether we'll do the new thing or we'll do the new behaviour. So from a personal perspective, I'll give the example of when we set up BAD two years ago, we looked at what we should be and I think we have to learn from what's around us. We've had a massive pivot away from traditional learning approaches and so we decided to even drop the word learning in our name. We focus on creating digital experiences that change behaviour, which is actually what learning's all about. But even just saying that, you realise that other people do this too, Steve gave that lovely example of marketeers, they're all about changing behaviour. So for us, it was defining us in broader terms. And then that gives us an opportunity to then, to pivot, to actually make sure that we can offer what we do, to others as well.\nNC: OK, I get that. But Steve, I want to bring this down to earth a little bit more say that I enjoy boating, which I've done and I discovered I wasn't a great leader, I didn't explain things to people very well, so I learnt a bit about myself as we all do. How do organisations actually tap that? Half the time you don't even know what people are doing outside the office.\nSG: So I think there's two angles to that. Firstly, it's not just about how organisations tap into the adjacent learning that people are doing outside of their role at work. It's also how we, as learning and development professionals, tap into adjacent communities to help us be better at what we do. So using your boating example Nigel, you could then apply this framework to look at what you can take from that, to then apply in your practice. So it's being intentional about the things that might not seem obvious at first. So reflective practice being a big part of learning and development.\nNC: The suggestion there Carol, is that we learn things outside, I know you don't like the term learn very much, but maybe we don't actually use them to improve bad habits or something.\nCB: Yeah, well I think we do. I think we do learn things outside and they do help us to improve habits. And I think we're using behavioural science a lot, we have a behavioural insights team, who know about changing behaviour. And I think, again, it's an adjacent community, but we can learn a lot from companies who create apps that are all about creating these habits, that change behaviour. And with the boating example and you also mentioned in your introduction, if you want to learn something, you go and look at a video. That's entirely right, that's what we do, that's how we learn. We learn in the moment, we learn based on the context, we have a problem to solve, I think we have to always think about learning as about solving a problem. So myself, I fixed my dishwasher the other day by looking at a YouTube video. And I think that as a learning organisation ourselves, we have to learn from those experiences and replicate them because these are the experiences that we're all familiar with. And I think we have to, we have to change that focus away from learning, being a once off event and it's happening, but we still got a lot of traditional learning out there that is all about telling, as opposed to influencing. And I think that's where we need to be moving to even more strongly than, stronger than we are now.\nNC: Steve.\nSG: Yeah, so I think the point Carol made there around moving from that telling approach, that also applies to how as learning development professionals we encourage people to bring that learning from outside the organisation into their work. If we're role modelling how we're bringing those experiences that we've had, to make us better professionals and to make us better at what we do, then that creates not just permission, in inverted commas, for other people to do that, it also starts to create that culture of sharing of expertise. And, yeah, like I say, it role models the behaviours that bring that about.\nNC: Just before we go back to Carol, Steve I'm not being funny, but to what extent is this just kind of rebranding of common sense? It is pretty obvious isn't it, that you learn a lot when you're off work doing something you choose, or you're seeking out knowledge that you need to complete some task you want to do? It's almost as if suddenly this is a thing, this is adjacent learning.\nSG: That's a fair challenge and my co-author David Hayden, talks about how common sense isn't necessarily common knowledge or even common practice. And I think one of the things that we can quite often see in organisations, is almost an artificial barrier between who we are and what we do outside of work and who we are and what we do inside of work. And one of the things that we can do through that role modelling, through being intentional about the way we bring learning from our activities outside work, is we can start to pull people out of context, so they can start to think not just about what they do. So maybe they coach a football team or coach a rugby team and that's made them a better manager through that coaching. But what are the behaviours that they're applying in that coaching and how can that transfer more broadly across work as well?\nNC: That's interesting, reminds me actually of, I used to do a fair bit of presentation training with people at one time and when they were uncertain interviewees, or they weren't seeming very confident, I'd say, look forget work, talk to me about your favourite hobby or the sport you do, or something you do outside of work. And quite often, people who were very dull suddenly became very passionate. And I think they then got the point, well why don't you put some of that into your work? Does that strike you as part of this Carol?\nCB: Yeah, most definitely. I think learning is a skill in itself and you're right, if we learn things that we care about, then we're not really thinking too hard about that process. But as a learning professional, if you think about that process and then think about behavioural science, how you can apply behavioural science principles to influence people, how you can get people to create those habits, make things stick, how you can get people to care about things. Then suddenly that's, that skill is really honed, that skill is honed. Myself, I've been learning Spanish on, using an app called Duolingo and the reason I'm, well there's two reasons for doing that, one is that I want to learn to speak Spanish, but the second reason is, that I want to understand how behavioural designers are designing apps that do influence behaviour change, influence people to create those really sticky habits where you sustain the habit. And I think I've been learning Spanish now for about 280 days, so it's working. Doing this stuff is for me common sense, but it's very valuable for me when I take that back into the workplace and I think about how we apply behavioural science, how we improve the learning experiences that we create to influence people to change their behaviours, or to influence their behaviours.\nNC: Well if that's the case, it's almost as if we're hearing here Steve, that understanding adjacent learning is as much for the trainer, for the L&D individual, in thinking a bit more carefully about how everything they do is delivered and how people are going to get a benefit from it and how they're going to learn from it.\nSG: Exactly that, we work in learning and development because we're passionate about learning and we're passionate about things like behaviour change. There can be a temptation, because we're always working at such pace, that there can be a temptation to almost narrow our focus. What we're talking about with adjacent learning is broadening that and making sure we're taking the best from multiple disciplines. And exactly as Carol said, learning is itself a skill and skills need to be practiced. I think it's a quote attributed to Einstein about how curiosity is superior to knowledge. And again, that's one of the things, that if we're intentional about adjacent learning, we are building that curiosity muscle and we're constantly looking at, why do people do this? How does that work? Why does that work as well as it does? So exactly that.\nNC: Now this is I think a difficult question because it takes us a bit away from the theory. But Carol, if we're agreed that all this stuff that you learn about yourself outside can be good for the organisation as a learning and development person, how do you actually ensure that some of this adjacent learning is making people better performers?\nCB: A lot has been said in the past about self directed learning and the importance of encouraging it, but I also think it's important to create mechanisms for sharing that. So replicating what's out there. We know how successful TikTok is, we know how successful social media platforms are, we talked about YouTube earlier, but we need to replicate that. We need to stop thinking about learning as a classroom event, or a digital learning program, it's a series of events. And then I was thinking a lot about the community or the team that I work within and we learnt through a community of practice and that's different every week we share stuff, we present stuff, some of it's formal, some of it's discussion based, some of it's problem solving or brainstorming, but it's in a learning experience nevertheless. So I think I was also reflecting on a conference I went to, I went to a neuro convention, which has nothing to do with learning, I just want to learn more about brain science and neuroscience and what's happening in a different field, because you can draw a lot of parallels from that. But I noticed that you could get CPD points for just attending. Now learning again there is being recognised as something that's not a formal event, attendance of event, being curious, Steve said are all important attributes to encourage. And I think, how do we bring it in? We encourage those attributes. We might create a platform that allows people to self select learning and we did actually do that once and allow people to select any topic they wanted, we didn't actually prescribe learning paths or curriculums for them, they could choose whatever they wanted to do, so if they wanted to learn crochet or cooking, they could do that. But encouraging people to learn and be curious is part of it. And actually, I think companies now are looking for people to be like that as part of their recruitment, they are looking for people who are perpetual learners, people who are curious, people who are happy to develop, that's almost as important as anything that's been learnt historically.\nNC: But there are, Steve, people who resist all this. There are people who keep their home life and their private life quite separate from work. They don't want to talk about, what they do at home and they might also regard it rather intrusive to have an interest in that. So, is that a danger sign almost with somebody who's a bit insular?\nSG: No I wouldn't call it a danger sign, I think it's really important we respect people's people's boundaries. And it's one of the most important things I think you can do as a manager, to your last question Nigel around how we extract it, is to understand what those boundaries are and to respect them. And if you can create an environment that is encouraging people to share and acknowledges that there might be some vulnerability about that sharing, if you can create that environment that encourages it and that's a good, good place to start.\nNC: How do you do that? Have you had experience of that with people who have opened up over time?\nSG: Yes I have. In my experience I think that there's no hard and fast rule, it's contextual depending on who you're working with. And it's really important that, as I say, you respect boundaries and you don't force anything. But to your earlier point Nigel, when people are passionate about something they can really open up and their enthusiasm can come across. And it can sometimes be as simple as just asking someone for advice on something. But just one personal example I've had is, being aware there's someone gradually opening up with one of their hobbies around cooking at weekends and then asking for their advice on something and then turning that into a conversation around structure planning and then discovering that through cooking, they have the most incredible project management skills, which are entirely untapped and which they can then bring into work.\nNC: So I suppose Carol you could have somebody who might be good at project management, but they've never been given the opportunity and their skills outside might never have been recognised.\nCB: It's so true,\nNC: Which just also leads me to the thought, well, is the onus on the individual to show they've got these skills? How do you actually get the two to meet?\nCB: I agree with, Steve that, the manager relationship plays an important role there in looking at the goals, the personal goals and aspirations of the individual. I had a, I had someone working with me who was working in a design role but, so graphics, UX, but had aspirations to get up on stage and do something like a Ted talk. This person, extremely creative, wanted to do this personally, but suddenly you realise as an organisation there's an opportunity there to help somebody to realise those passions in a work context. So through an adaption of the role, it's like changing role, within the business, suddenly those opportunities became real and this individual then worked in more of a marketing led role, getting involved in events and has actually now done a presentation. So she's still, she's leading towards her big goal of getting up on stage one day and doing a Ted talk. And I think that's inspirational. And I think that businesses too have a responsibility to keep their talent within the business. We've got a lot of people moving around at the moment, so it's important that people can realise their personal goals through work too. So I think it's great when someone can align the two.\nNC: OK. And what help might adjacent learning be, in a situation where you've got somebody who has many of the right qualities for a promotion, but is lacking in some particular area, that may be something they're personally well aware of. You can't kind of ask somebody to go on a, I don't know, sale training or something, but can you think of ways that this approach might be helpful in sort of building them as a person?\nSG: It's a really nice continuation from Carol's point. So again I'm going to quote David Hayden, who is very fond of saying, we are more than our role. And if you can identify where perhaps people have development needs that aren't immediately available within their role, you can find other passions that inspire them, that can help them address some of those gaps, address some of those development areas. Then not only are you showing them that you have empathy with them, that you can hear them, that you see them as a whole person, which again, is incredibly important, but you're also helping them be the best they can be out of work as well as in work. Which again is something that, as a manager, I really aspire towards people seeing work as a springboard, not just to earning a living, but to more than that too.\nNC: Do you think Carol, a lot of senior managers might be sceptical about all this, if it involves effort around things which are not even directly related to the day-to-day functions of the organisation?\nCB: I guess the answer to that is sort of yes and no. I do believe that organisations now are so focused on retaining talent and essentially stopping the talent drain, that they're going to have a focus more on helping people to realise their personal ambitions. I do think it obviously has a lot to do with culture too, within organisations certainly encourages that. Ultimately yes, organisations often have targets and they're target driven, but if they allow individuals some flexibility within that and they are reaching the, their performance goals, then I can't see why it would be an issue. I do believe that a lot of organisations are very forward thinking when it comes to encouraging people to self develop and redevelop skills. We have people within the business who have taken responsibility to learn things themselves within their own time and then have created products within the business and changed roles. That is all to do with innovating, that's how businesses change, that's how businesses innovate, through that passion. So I think it's not a good thing to suppress it.\nSG: Yeah. I think that there's also something in recognising the talents that people have got, that they may not necessarily see themselves. So full disclosure that Carol and I actually worked together several years ago and there's one project we worked on where we were working on a new UX, so user experience for a piece of learning. And where we would typically just work with our ad designers and our visual people around that approach, for this one we broadened out the pool that were involved and some of the greatest input we had into that conversation was one of our coders, who you might not typically associate with being so visual and design driven, but they played lots of games and because of the way that games are designed to be intuitive and motivational, he was able to offer incredibly valuable input that changed the way that we thought.\nNC: So how to get started on this, if adjacent learning is something that you haven't really thought about very much in your practice, Carol, how do you start?\nCB: Well, I think first of all, organisation has to encourage it. I would say from a personal point of view, again I like to talk about my own personal learning experience is, look outside of the obvious places. So it would be very easy for me to just go along to learning trade shows and conferences to learn about the latest thinking, the latest stuff that everyone else is doing. But I chose to go to exhibitions that covered subjects like, how artificial intelligence is being applied in business, how products are being created with AI engines to change the way that things are done. Cybersecurity is a great example of that, where one guy created this product to essentially predict what sort of cybersecurity threats would exist in the future. Now we spend a lot of time creating compliance learning, all about helping people to avoid typical cybersecurity issues. But this other example showed me a different way of thinking, it's about, it's a future thinking approach, it's beyond the reactive approach we often take with learning. Another example is, I mentioned going to the neuro convention, just seeing what people are doing to help patients who have had like some cognitive challenges, what apps are being created to help them, again you can learn so much from that. So I would say if you want to get started, go beyond your own area, your own industry, marketeers, they do this stuff they have bigger budgets, it's a natural place often to go to look at how they use insights and how they drive behaviour change. And even look at some of the debate around the ethical considerations that need to be had. So just widening your thinking beyond your space, I think is the way to start.\nNC: Yes it's interesting that, that focus is a bit different to what I was thinking when we started this was, there's a great fashion for learning from sport and from some of the things we talked about earlier, with the hobbies and past times, but this really is now Steve, very much into the sort of science of what people do, but moving it away from the immediate office situation.\nSG: It's being curious and it's being curious about everything, it's that piece I said earlier around breaking out of context. So it's looking beyond what you're doing and looking what you can bring in from elsewhere. Again, Carol's used some personal examples, as a personal example for me, I'm training in counselling and I've found nothing has improved my ability as a manager more than training in counselling. So the amount of counselling theory I bring into one to one conversations into the ways that I interact with people, particularly around some of those challenging conversations, is absolutely never ending. So it's looking outside that context and not seeing things as bound by just where they originate, but seeing how everything is applicable, incredibly broadly.\nNC: So we're not going to go back to the days of the compulsory office away day building a box girder bridge?\nSG: I wouldn't want to tell, I'm sure that's got its space.\nNC: A lot of us still have nightmares about that sort of thing. It's been a great discussion. Thank you both very much. You'll find resources on adjacent learning on the CIPD website. Steve's book for Kogan Page with David Hayden is out when?\nSG: 3 February 2023.\nNC: OK. Just wait till the New Year for that. And Carol you'll find on the BAD website. Next time we hope to be looking at the four day week desired by many workers certainly, but rather mixed experiences in organisations so far, we'll look at what we already know about how it might shake out. So please subscribe to this podcast so you never miss an addition, but for now until next time, from me Nigel Cassidy and all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:33:22\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: When the trust has gone, ideas to repair and rebuild relationships when people have been let down. I'm, Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nTrust is the essence of good leadership. It's essential for workplace relationships to survive and deliver results, but let's face it, trust isn't really what it was in many places. Take our national politics here in the UK, we rightly despair at the leadership tone set from the top by the outgoing UK prime minister no less caught lying and presenting selective facts to Parliament. Would you believe, more than half the CEOs poll by PWC thought a lack of trust was a threat to growth? Yet they've done little to boost it. Maybe that's because they don't know how to do that, which is where this podcast comes in with us. With us, Richard Nolan, Chief People Officer at the cloud based software provider EPOS. Now he's set up and grown people centric cultures for a string of successful brands. Hello Richard.\nRichard Nolan: Hi Nigel, great to be with you today.\nNC: And Veronica Hope Hailey HR, thought leader and Emeritus Professor at University of Bath and frequent CIPD collaborator. She says trust is the new leadership test. Hello, Veronica.\nVeronica Hope Hailey: Hello everybody.\nNC: So Veronica, I'll start with you. Lost trust, it's a big issue for organisations externally, public scandals, being caught profiteering, lack of transparency and all that, but within organisations, well people experience it every day and it's a lot harder to pin down, isn't it? If you take the whole spectrum of complaints from broken promises to nobody addressing problems or giving feedback. So taking all this into account, I wonder what are the sort of trust deficits in organisations that really matter?\nVHH: So I think right at the moment, we're in a good place and a bad place with organisational trust. The good place is that actually, through the pandemic CEOs and senior teams and my research shows this, have actually demonstrated themselves to be highly trustworthy. They have shown themselves capable of taking organisations through transition. They've been in very, very empathetic and caring, and they've actually used their moral codes as north stars and compasses to drive the organisation, decide how it should see itself through this kind of fog of uncertainty that Covid's been. I think the issue is now, is how much they've managed to take people with them through the crisis Nigel, by trading on some of the reservoirs of trust that were built up before the crisis. And that varies from organisations to organisations.\nNC: I just wonder if we could just bring this slightly more down to earth. What are the real issues that upset people within organisations, where they just no longer trust their leaders and their managers?\nVHH: Well, let's just be careful with the evidence here. I think what you will find is there are problems in the public sector right now, because there is a feeling that the front line workers in the public sector, and that wasn't just the medical staff that was water authorities, railway workers, people who stayed on the front line during Covid, as one CEO put to me, a pharmacy CEO said to me, my people were the people that were coughed on. There's a feeling that a lot of those front line workers took risks on behalf of the rest of us. And whilst in the first year of the pandemic, we all got on the doorsteps and clapped our saucepan lids, there is frankly a feeling that their risk taking has not really been appreciated by the great British public. And it's not being shown with realistic pay rises to deal with the cost of living increases caused by the rampant inflation at the moment. So they feel --\nNC: So essentially they're being taken for granted.\nVHH: They feel as though they're being taken for granted.\nNC: Richard Nolan we are talking here about broken trust and how to fix it, in your experience, what sort of issues arise most frequently, where you've tried to recast organisations to get around this?\nRN: I think the first challenge that I see on a frequent basis during my tenure in HR and leadership, is lack of clarity, lack of vision, lack of purpose and an ethical, sustainable why, as to why the business exists. I think you could break this down into different sectors in the working environment, i.e, if you've got a high growth corporate environment versus an entrepreneurial high growth business, I think both of them have very different challenges and both of them are trying to address them very differently. High growth tends to have a very clear vision and has to buy people in based on that clarity of vision. Large corporate environments have the ability and the flexibility to probably waiver their vision a little bit but have the ability to remunerate staff much more to engage them. I think getting the clarity of vision, purpose and strong emphasis on ethical purpose, is probably one of the biggest challenges, but one of the most successful outputs you can do is you get it right and implement it consistently and become credible and reliable in delivery.\nNC: I want to really talk about the practicalities of fixing broken trust, but just before we do that Richard, do you think this problem we've got in public life with behaviour of politicians, those external factors have actually added to a climate of distrust within organisations, has it somehow set a bad tone, are there any consequences?\nRN: In my opinion, absolutely yes.\nNC: Why?\nRN: I think you've seen public scrutiny having a greater implication on brand purpose, and an organisation, how it operates. I think you've seen leaders of organisations being looked to, to make political stances on certain events that are happening in society. And you've seen this happen with things like Black Lives Matter, organisations, brands, businesses are starting to stand up and launch strategies and initiatives, that doesn't just align with their brand and the intention of the organisation but stands up for social injustice and stands up for representation of the workforce that they work with.\nNC: But what are you saying here? Are you saying that these people should be able to be trustworthy without having to do all that?\nRN: Oh no, no, I'm saying it's becoming more important for, leaders in organisations to become a pivotal, I would say figurehead, as well as the PM, as well as leaders in society, as well as role models, to stand up and be accountable for what is happening in society. And if they disagree with something, they're being held accountable by their employees to stand up and act and deliver and hold their own views accordingly.\nNC: So Veronica, Richard seems to be saying that expectations of trust levels have changed. It's almost like organisations are on the back foot. And of course we've got this rising generation, Generation Z, who themselves have different expectations.\nVHH: Well, there are two different things that are being talked about here. So there's trust in an organisation and what you might expect from an organisation in terms of purpose and values and its engagement with critical social issues. And then there is the issue of an individual leader's trustworthiness. Really, really simple people decide whether or not to trust an individual leader, based on the fact, are they able and competent, are they bothered about other people and thirdly, do they have some kind of integrity or character that they admire? And all the research on trust breakdowns and repairs shows this, people will forgive an individual CEO, prime minister, permanent secretary, where they make mistakes. It is possible to not be 100% perfect and still be trusted. What is much more difficult to mend, is something where people see that there has been a lack of integrity and there are questions over the characters of individual leaders. And at that point, you can get what we call the Humpty Dumpty syndrome, which is the idea that Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, all the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again.\nNC: OK, so I'm going to put you on the spot here, Veronica. How can you tell if your organisation has a trust issue, probably arising from leadership mistakes, that cannot be fixed? You're saying that there are times when you just have to do something very drastic, you can't repair.\nVHH: OK, so the issue facing some organisations at the moment and luckily and let's be really clear about this Nigel, we're talking often about quite small proportions of organisations, small percentages. It's not that the whole of the business or the public sector is untrustworthy, that would be unnecessarily dramatic.\nNC: Well I was thinking, what about for example, the police might be an example might it --\nVHH: Yes.\nNC: With these persistent problem, institutional problems with misogyny and bullying and all that?\nVHH: So, OK, so if you take the case of the Met Police and the way that they are handling, the Met Police inquiry is classic textbook, what we would say to people you should do, which is that they've exited some of those people tainted by the scandal and they are now asking Dame Louise Casey to do an independent investigation. Now, to answer your original question Nigel, the question that Louise Casey and the Met Police and the new commissioner will have to ask themselves, is, was this an individual bad apple, or is it a cultural issue? And if it is a cultural issue, then you are into major transformational change and you will, in HR terms, have to reconsider every single aspect of HR. How you recruit people, how you select them, how you promote them, how you train and develop them. It may be in some cases elsewhere, the organisation is broken up into different units and in effect, it starts again and tries to rebuild trust that way. And that's exactly what's happening with the Met Police at the moment. Those are the questions that Dame Louise Casey, very experienced person, will be asking.\nNC: Well Richard, Veronica's set out pretty clearly some of the things you have to do, can we turn that a bit more into a strategy? Can you just fill in some of the detail, on how you would approach a big change in an organisation, to try and deal with a trust issue?\nRN: Yeah. Look, if I start with the biggest mistake, in my experience, that people make when entering, how you identify it Veronica already articulated, but you see it through observation, you see it through high levels of churn, low levels of engagement, your default measures are there, the data will typically do the talking, if you speak to the right people they will tend to tell you the right answers. I think the challenge you have, especially for people going into an organisation, they always use the textbook activity around understanding and learning culture. And that tends to be, let's run a workshop, you speak to the CEO, run a workshop and tell us what's wrong with our culture. OK. And they'll go, right, they'll send out a survey to everyone and the survey will be populated by employees, or they'll run a seminar and invite everyone to come to the seminar. And then you'll sit around that conversation and you've identified some of the problems and you'll go, right guys, can you help and work with me to make this executionable and make it deliverable? Low and behold it fails. Why does it fail? Because when you look at most of all, most organisations, you can break up the, the makeup of the employee base can be split into categories. You've got your super highly engaged employees, that you can tell them to run through walls and they'll probably do it for you. That is probably your top 5% to 10% of employees, not necessarily best performers, but ones that are highly bought into your vision and your purpose. And they'll be the ones that if you send out the survey, they'll complete it immediately and they'll be highly engaged. Opposite end of the scale you've probably got your five to ten highly disengaged, highly critical, they're the hardest ones that you'll be able to take through any culture migration at all. Now everyone in the middle, you've got 70% of the organisation I would classify as, a bit cynical, so probably yes, you can take them on the change, but can you actually change them overnight? Probably not. And the worst thing leaders tend to do, is they'll go to the workshop, they'll go to the seminar, they'll do the surveys, guess who completes it? The top 10%. So they go away from that meeting and go, actually, there's nothing wrong with our culture, we need to do these activities, they'll launch a strategy of execution and it falls flat on its face. And why does it fall flat on its face? Because the cynical people in the middle haven't been engaged, because you've got to work to engage them. So the best way you could do that is, cut out the leadership team from the initial discussions, get straight to the base of the employee population and make them work to attend. So if you get them to work, do an exercise, make sure the people are bought into why they are going to participate, then lead with their delivery, get them to build it with you, build a framework off the back of it and execute consistently, doing that will give you much stronger results as part of it.\nNC: And Veronica, does your research back up this kind of approach?\nVHH: I think, interestingly I would say that my research shows that if you want to high trust culture, one of the things you've got to have are employees that understand that trust is a two way relationship. And actually it's not just about, what an HOD or a CEO does, but it's actually how the employees act within an organisation.\nNC: Yes, I saw some interesting findings on this, some research by the Workforce Institute UKG, suggesting that three quarters of chiefs think it's up to the employees to earn trust. So their default position is, they don't trust them. I wonder, should they change their attitude?\nVHH: Well, I think what Covid has done, as I said, is actually shift things, because the CEOs and the leaders in Covid had no choice, particularly in the first six to nine months of the pandemic, but to trust downwards and decentralise decision making. So glory, glory, actually, unlike your survey from 2020, what they then discovered is that they could trust people extremely well. The majority, let's always talk about the majority, of people could be trusted. And when I'm interviewing them right now about what they've learnt about Covid, is that actually one of the things is, they don't want to lose that empowerment that they gave the workforce because they trusted them more. But my point back Nigel is this, is that followers have also got, employees have got some responsibilities as well and we have got really judgmental on senior leaders. Leaders are put on a pedestal and they're meant to be practically perfect in every way, as Mary Poppins would've said, and they're not, they're human, they're going to make a mistake. Now if you make a horrendous mistake, that really questions your integrity, or really, really questions how able you are to actually do your job, OK, fair enough, you may not be forgiven. But I think, one of the things I would say about society and about employees is, that we've become much more suspicious as a society.\nNC: So how do you fix that? If the boss has got an undeserved bad reputation?\nVHH: Well, what they've done, what they've done during Covid has actually done a lot to repair that, it may not have been deliberate at the beginning, but this whole extra accessibility and visibility of human resource directors, CEOs, CFOs, PP being beaned into each other's sitting rooms, has actually increased trust, because they can see them as people. And they're much, it's much more able to trust somebody that you have more access to that is closer to you, that's in greater proximity. We know that line, local managers are always trusted more than senior managers before Covid, because people saw them more regularly. In Covid what's happened through this amazing tech transition, is that actually people have had much more access to senior leaders. And one of the key things, to maintain trust going forwards Nigel, is that, that access and that extra visibility that the senior teams gave to the workforces, all around the world, I think needs to be maintained.\nNC: So you do need this feedback loop? You need to have that set up --\nVHH: Yeah.\nNC: So that you don't, if you do put things right, you don't slip back. I just want to pass this over to Richard, because you used a phrase there, I blanch slightly, you talked about, a high trust organisation. Richard, do you think such a thing exists?\nRN: Look, I do think they exist, but what's the benefit of trust in an organisation? The benefit is you have a super, highly engaged workforce that deliver great results. Really, really simply. Now the problem you've, that I see here, is trust is one element associated with creating that highly engaged workforce and it's a super important one, but it's not the only one. So yes, you may have circumstances where a leader becomes, or makes a mistake, absolutely agree, they can make a mistake and they can recover the situation and we're all human, so that happens. But I think as an organisation, to create a high trust environment, a highly engaged workforce, they have to do more than just build trust. And if I pivot back to the question you asked about 75% of leaders saying that trust must be earned. I do think trust is a two way street, it's a deal, you're going into employment, it's a deal. The business upholds their half, the employer upholds theirs. But I also think the onus should be considered, if I cast this back, keeping it really simple, if I go all the way back quite a long time, but to my first day at school. I'm going into an, into a situation into an environment that promised me betterment. It was going to be an education. I was really nervous going in there, I take my kids now they're very nervous, that school has to create an environment that enables the children there to flourish. An organisation's no different, but the problem you have in my perspective around individuals going into employment, is I actually believe legislation typically hinders that, because people going into a new job has probationary periods, they've got much higher risk, they've got legislation that works against them, the inability, unless it's certain discriminatory acts, they've got the inability to make employment claims. You're already going into that job thinking, what if it goes wrong? I'm putting everything on the line to make this a success and I want it to be a success, but safety is a big aspect around creating a hugely, a high, highly engaged workforce and it hinders trust. So if you can't necessarily create that environment, the leaders can't create an environment for people to be safe, how can they create high trusting environment?\nNC: And of course, Veronica, a lot of organisations, particularly for people at the lower end of the pay scale, everything is set up to monitor and control what they do within an inch of their lives. And it doesn't seem that they are trusted to do the job.\nVHH: No I think that has honestly been a problem over the last 20, 25 years, as we've got cleverer and cleverer systems for monitoring people, as you say, Nigel, within an inch of their lives.\nNC: But I mean, can people managers change that, they don't run the businesses?\nVHH: Well, they can change the systems that they use to monitor and measure performance. Yes. I would say 10, 20 organisations that we've talked to, would be talking about the shift to performance management, being much more about coaching, about checking in, not checking up and one HRD said to me, you know what I realised through Covid? That the majority of our policies are designed to catch the 3% that are possibly doing something wrong, or poor performers, rather than celebrating the 97% that are actually delivering really, really well. And I think you'll see one of the lasting effects of the last two and a half years of leading through this pandemic, will be a shift in how HR sees its role in measuring performance. You're right, there will have to be other areas of the business where that is also adjusted. And you're absolutely right, Nigel, that the more you measure and monitor, the less trusted people feel. Einstein's got a great quote, which is, it goes something like, just because you can count it, doesn't mean it counts. Which I think is brilliant. You know, just because you can measure something, doesn't mean you should measure it. There's something Onora O'Neill, who's a really famous commentator on trust, calls intelligent accountability. So let's be intelligent about what we hold people accountable for, let's not take a sledgehammer to break a nut and not, let's not design a policy that is all about catching the bad apple rather than celebrating the good orchard that we've got in this workforce.\nRN: The thing that I'll be pretty critical here, organisations for many generations have seen chief people or people officers, HRDs, are second fiddles to other leadership roles within in an organisation. And I think the last two to three years, due to challenges regarding talent acquisition, Covid the pandemic, CEOs are starting to stand up and actually re-evaluate the importance of people within their organisation.\nVHH: Yeah. I agree with that.\nRN: And I think we have to change that. But I do think there's an onus on CPOs or HRDs to become commercially savvy. One of the things that I've always done in every role I've been in is, learn the P&L and the commercials of that organisation, as well as the CFO, because we need to be able to articulate the benefit and the value of people, from an ethical sustainability perspective and a cultural perspective and a commercial perspective. And you need to bridge the three of them in a way that helps drive the right culture and the culture of trust.\nNC: I get that Richard, but isn't the danger that instead of being a guardian of fairness and doing things the right way, the people manager, the human resources people, in that model, become an extension of the commercial business? The employees who feel they've been unfairly treated, who feel they don't trust the management, might not feel that, those are the best people to solve their problems or at least understand them.\nRN: I think you may have a risk of that if you've not articulated the purpose, the vision, the principles, the culture, the values, in a way that the business understands. I think there is a risk of that. But I also think there's an ability, through understanding the commercials to navigate and migrate a business through strong commercial, but positive ethical change, that drives the right performance. And Veronica was absolutely right, we don't measure everything. What you want to understand is, how do you maximise the benefit of an individual? You have to realise that an individual coming into an organisation, they only have a finite amount of time, we all have one life, we have one finite amount of time and individuals are investing the one indispensable quality, and that's time, to your organisation. And organisations need to take accountability to maximise the experience, the quality, the journey, to drive results, but to drive a good experience at the same time. I think getting that right with staff in a commercial way that drives the business and you're able to articulate in a way that is also reflected the numbers, I think you should be in a good space.\nNC: Richard, it's always good to learn lessons from examples of where trust has broken down. Are there any that particularly speak to you?\nRN: I think the most frequent thing that I see generally day to day, especially speaking to peers across the HR network, is when times get to tough, organisations tend to pivot back to type. So if you've got a, an organisation that's gone through cultural change, you've defined the culture, you've defined the values, defined the behaviours and you've gone through a real great exercising in mapping all this out and communicating it effectively to staff. What you tend to find is if performance dips, you can find organisations start to struggle to maintain that level of value and commitment to them behaviours. And that can sometimes lead to things like micromanagement, that can lead to things around, probably operating contrary to probably what they've defined and they've committed to. And I think the biggest area that I see these challenges happening is around things like, organisations when they're publicly promoting what their performance has been. So they build a, they'll build a commission scheme, commission scheme articulated to staff will say, right, this is our target and then what will happen is, they get to the end of the performance window and they communicate externally to manage their brand and their PR, their performance is amazing. So everything's fantastic, we've grown x%, performance is phenomenal, however, internally they've missed their targets. And then you're trying to articulate and balance an external message with an internal message, saying we're not able to pay bonus. And you've automatically started to degrade that and erode that trust barrier. Now the simple wins and we've already articulated some of them, around how you can avoid this and mitigate this and make it a success, but that to me, is probably the most frequent areas where I see that the trust tends to be broken within organisations across the spectrum\nNC: And what crops up for you a lot, Veronica?\nVHH: So if you, for me, if you look back at the big corporate scandals that have gone on, that have really contributed to a breakdown of trust in society, I think they fall into again, three categories. The banking crisis was about people questioning, how the heck did we end up with people leading banks, that didn't seem to understand the interconnectedness of the global financial system? That was their ability and competence. And secondly, seemed to be excessively greedy about their own rewards and not sufficiently bothered about the long term impact on their customers and their savings and society in general. If you take the VW issue, of the carbon emission scandal in the States, that was much more of a, an issue about moral codes and integrity, because VW was found to be being economical with the truth with both customers and the US government. So, the breaches normally are either around, actually this is a really important public institution, like a bank or like the Met Police and actually are you able to lead this mate? And in the way you lead it, are you actually mindful of others and the rest of the impact on society? And what does it say about your integrity and character, if in some cases you've got people actually lying to either customers or regulatory authorities? That's where these corporate scandals come from and the problem is --\nNC: So that would be an example of where you would say, it can't be fixed, that's a lost trust issue, you have to be much more (inaudible)\nVHH: You go and talk to RBS about how long it's taken them to repair the trust from the financial crisis. This is why trust really matters. And, Richard was talking earlier about its one of the ingredients, for me, it's the building block. We know high trust delivers engagement, innovation, problem solving, commitment to change. It's the foundation from which all the other good things come. And that is why those who have had the unfortunate disaster of losing it as a business, will never ever take it for granted again. BAE Systems CFO, BAE Systems is a wonderful organisation, Brad Greve is their chief finance officer, he said to me, BAE Systems believes that trust is the essential magic for an organisation and it needs to be worked on every single day.\nNC: Great. So bringing this together then, let's have just a few top tips from each of you, or maybe slightly quicker wins to fix a lack of trust.\nVHH: If you make a mistake, if you do a breach of trust, main thing is, to first of all apologise, take responsibility and explain how you know that something went wrong and what you're going to do to make it better. And the explanation of what went wrong, is really, really important, people need to hear that. And then you actually, literally ask for forgiveness and you spend the next two years, whether you are an individual or an organisation, turning up the volume on your sources of trustworthiness. I call it, when I'm working with organisations I call it, turn up the volume on showing they can trust you, because you're capable, you're bothered about other people and you have a good character and a sense of integrity that they can trust in. You're not perfect, you've apologised and you will do your best not to make a mistake again, but, if it's a really, really bad flaw in integrity and character Nigel, as I've said, it may be difficult to move on and we've seen that played out in public life recently.\nNC: And of course, Richard, final thoughts from you. Some people find it difficult to apologise, that it becomes like a child saying sorry.\nRN: I, look the simple advice from my side, echo's Veronica's to a degree, recognise the problem and own it. Every leader needs to recognise the problem, own the problem. The second thing for me would be, work with staff to build the utopia. This is not a leader, steering, driving the boat forward, you work with staff to define where they want to get to in a collaborative way and go on the journey with them, get them all driving the bus. Then the next thing would be, repeated delivery. Keep telling them what you're going to do and deliver and frequent positive communication underpinning the delivery is key. The one recommendation to all leaders, I would say, be flexible. At the end of the day, if you're going into that conversation with no willingness to change, don't do it, you're wasting your time. You have to be flexible, willing to change, or if not, it will block your ability of cultural change and the success off the back of it.\nNC: Great advice.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:32:20\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: What's the point of HR, is it time for a change to make its purpose better known and understood? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNot for the first time. The role that HR plays in organisations has been in the news, recently it was the Octopus Energy chief Greg Jackson who brought things to a head when he said, human resource departments don't make staff happier or more productive, so his billion-pound energy company doesn't have one. So, one moment people professionals get applauded for going beyond employment form filling and compliance to make the workplace better, but then they get it in the neck for what's seen as mission creep into public agenda crusading on equality wellbeing or other topics. So, what should HR really encompass and what's the right way for it to evolve? We've three top guests to get to grips with this one, firstly from Henley Business School we welcome Associate Professor Dr Washika Haak-Saheem who came to academia bringing a wealth of management experience with international businesses. Hello.\nWashika Haak-Saheem: Hello Nigel.\nNC: It's a welcome return to the podcast for the CIPDs Membership Director David D'Souza. Hi.\nDavid D'Souza: Hello.\nNC: But first to a business change specialist who has some, sometimes controversial, views on HR. She's certainly challenged the need for it to be always run inhouse, she's Kat Navarro. Hello.\nKat Navarro: Hi Nigel.\nNC: So, Kat, come on, give it to us straight, reading your posts you've often found inhouse HR departments slightly getting in the way of the job you do when you go into an organisation. So OK, what's wrong with HR in your view, to the point where, as we've heard, some leaders are actually making a thing about trying to get rid of it?\nKN: That's right. Look I, I think there's actually two things that I would say is possibly wrong with HR as we know it today and one of those is about the history and the setup of it and the other is about the focus. So, if we think about history and setup, HR was created a really long time ago when the workplace was very, very different. People stayed in one job for a long time and HR was there to ensure contracts got created, people got paid, companies were compliant, and today the workplace is hugely different, mostly due to the booming dot coms and technology. You've got more companies than ever before, meaning more competition, it's harder to hire and retain talent. You've got greater demands on individuals because they're needing to innovate and create faster than ever before. Knowledge is much more accessible, so you've got, which is great because you've got topics like mental health and diversity and inclusion, which are at the forefront of everyone's mind, but it also means that people have this growth mindset and they're learning independently and they're expecting so much more from employers. So suddenly it's not just a need for personnel admin and ensuring that employment law is adhered to, there's also a need to ensure that people are being sourced and hired and engaged and developed and retained well. And the issue we have is that some companies lumped all of that together. So, they thought, great, well we have a team that looks after people related things and we have all these new people needs, so let's put them all together. Which to me is a mistake because they're fundamentally different things. So adherence to employment law is a very, very specialist field and, to me, it needs to remain 100% objective and separate from the day to day running of the business, in the sense that those that are there to give guidance on that, shouldn't necessarily become friends with other employees and it does need to be kept quite separate, to the point where I would argue that it's actually a lot better to outsource that to specialists so that it can remain so impartial. Whereas the talent engagement side, how we hire and engage and develop talent, to me this is the exact opposite, it needs to be fully embedded within the workplace because it's about the hearts and minds of individuals.\nNC: Do you mean not done by HR at all?\nKN: I mean it's done by different people, call it what you will, but it needs to be done by very different specialists. And if you try and merge the two and have one individual trying to be impartial, objective and ensure that the business is complying with the laws of employment and then you have that same person trying to win the hearts and minds of managers and individuals and trying to help engage and retain and develop talent, naturally going to see a conflict.\nNC: All right, well there's a lot there and perhaps we can unpack some of the detail in a few moments, but just looking broadly at this reaction against HR and I wonder whether it's got anything to do with that massive growth like topsy that you've described. David D'Souza, what do you see as the reasons for these media attacks and in particular, organisations like Octopus wanting to publicly say they've done away with the HR function altogether, even if well maybe they haven't entirely?\nDDS: So I think there's a few interesting things going on, just following from Kat, so there's a question around what you're trying to achieve. So, what are you trying to enable in organisations and what are you trying to deliver? And then there's a question around how the resources of the organisation are set up and organised to deliver that. And if you look at some of the organisations saying they don't have HR, in fact what they've got is a different delivery method for that, or they have a disaggregation of some of those parts of the function. At the CIPD, we talk about nine different specialisms that go up to make the people profession as a whole. And actually you can deliver some of those in very different ways and you can organise and collate or disaggregate them in different ways as well.\nNC: I was just amused to see the piece, you described something as, Schrodinger's HR, what did you mean by that?\nDDS: Well yeah, Schrodinger's HR for me is the fact that there are some organisations that both claim to not have HR and have all of the HR capabilities at the same time. So I think it's quite attractive and it seems quite progressive, or disruptive, to say that you don't have it, but actually there a number of reasons that those capabilities are core to both growing organisations and established organisations. Sometimes it's about what you call them, sometimes it's about how you organise them, sometimes it's whether actually some of those, to Kat's point, are done external to the organisation. So, you might outsource some elements of it, or work in partnership. But the key is, they do tend to exist because they do tend to be needed. So what you're looking at is the requirement and then working out the best way to fulfil that. And that may change by sector, it might change by stage of growth and maturity of the organisation, but generally getting people in a legal way, making sure that you're dealing with them effectively, helping them and enabling them to grow and do their jobs exceptionally and having those things join up in a sensible way, so you don't end up with policies that are getting in the way of some of the other things you'd like to do. It's a sensible thing for any organisation that wants to succeed to do, the challenge is how are you best organise, how you best shape, how you best resource to do that.\nNC: So Washika Haak-Saheem, if that's true then where have things gone slightly wrong, so that you do have these rather persistent stories about people wanting to get rid of a department, which one would've thought could serve the organisation in the ways that we've heard from David?\nWHS: I would start with the HR by itself, as Kat was rightly saying, businesses evolve. Unfortunately, many HR functions could not maintain the same pace of development and direction. Today we, still when we talk about HR, we still think about this paper pushing function which is very much considered with filling the forms and making sure that everything is correctly recorded. My view would be that, many of these functions could be outsourced, such as payroll, for me, it doesn't make sense to maintain payroll in house, but well HR makes great sense. And I believe the pandemic was a great eye opener. When it comes to the human factor in an organisation we need to build HR capabilities around, how could people contribute, add value, to the bottom line to the organisation. We can call it engagement, we can talk about strategic alignment, we can talk about who is delivering HR in an organisation. It is, it depends on organisations, it depends on the size of the organisation, for example when we compare HR capabilities in small medium enterprises to large multinationals, they look very, very different and there is a reason why they look different. But having said this, I think it is high time for HR to step out and to step up and make sure that they are known as a function. It could be a single individual, it could be, I work with Emirates Airlines for example here in Dubai at the moment, they have an HR department of 5,000 people.\nNC: Wow.\nWHS: It depends on the organisation by itself. But a bottom line is, it is a good time for HR, it's the right time for HR to step up\nNC: Kat Navarro do you agree with that?\nKN: I do, and it's actually a nice segue to what I see as the second issue and I think, why these teams are struggling so much. So if you are in a people team, HR team, talent team, whatever it's called, ask yourself this, who is it that you are trying to serve? Are you serving the employee or are you serving the manager? And I think it's a really interesting question, because I believe successful teams are the ones that focus on managers. It is the manager's role to attract, to hire, to engage, to develop, to retain talent, but they obviously can't do this without help. Much like if we want abs of steel, we hire a personal trainer, if we want perspective on our life, we bring on a therapist or a coach. You need a team who is there to partner with managers and help them achieve this, and ensure that it's done at a consistently high standard and that it's on brand, for the company but there are many teams that make the mistake of trying to ultimately manage staff themselves and that's where it leads to conflict. And I see this happening a lot. You see people teams, or HR teams, trying to take on training of staff, solving their problems, being the go-to for any issue in the workplace and in turn you see people going to them with those things, and all you're doing there is, you're stunting the growth of the manager. You're putting a wedge in the relationship between employee and their manager. You're causing tensions with the manager and you're stopping the company being able to scale, because there's ineffective managers who aren't able to do the job that they need to do for the company to be successful.\nNC: I just want to take that up immediately with David D'Souza, does that not reduce the people, managers or the HR people, whatever you want to call it, to a kind of advisor to the managers, that's a slightly different vision of human resources when it works well, isn't it David?\nDDS: I don't think it's wholly different for many organisations. I think the criticality of the line manager is clear, that's some of the day to day interaction happens there. I think HR and people profession more broadly, they're critical enabling functions. It's hard to do the work without them well, but actually you should be educating and supporting others to do them, we don't need to be the heart of that work and in fact it's almost impossible to do the heart of some of that work.\nNC: And while I'm with you David, also this question of whether the human resources person is working for the manager, or has some special responsibility towards the staff, we were getting pretty clear message from Kat that they are working for the bosses basically.\nDDS: Well, I think if you look at why an organisation would have a function like this. So if you step back a bit and think of it from the ultimate view, it's to do all of the things that Kat described, it's to do that range of activities, at times most of the time it's to the benefit of the organisation to treat people well, there will be occasions where actually there's a function that needs to do something that people wouldn't like. So, if you look at a redundancy situation, it may be absolutely necessary for the organisation to do it, no person would ever want to be in that position, but you need someone at that point. And this is where I think there's a slight distinction, you need that someone at that point, not just to run a process, but to help people through a process. And that's where the congruence with culture comes in, that even the things that are technical requirements, there are different ways of delivering them with compassion, with heart, with dignity, and that's why it's really important that actually, there's an overview as an organisation, of what you want that experience to be at every point in their value chain, or life cycle of the employee. And that's why I think it's imperative that these things are, even if they are slightly spread apart, even if you are outsourcing something, the cultural piece that sits at the heart of it, the employee will always associate that with you, when they've been treated well, whether they're treating badly you can't go, well that's not a bit we do, that is their experience in and of and given by you. And that's what's really important that, one it's joined up, two that it's congruent and consistent, but three that great care is taken with every single bit, because you only need one part not to stack up and people go, actually it doesn't quite feel right here.\nNC: Yes, I absolutely get that. And talking about the different things that um people managers deliver, that HR has within its brief, I mentioned at the start this mission creep which is often singled out in the press, one of the things that seems to wind up its critics, for what it's worth we commissioned a poll in the CIPD's newsletter, we asked if people teams should respond to concerns about things like climate change, poverty, tackling racism, 52% said yes, 40% said no. So fairly evenly divided, some scepticism about that mission, Kat Navarro where do you stand on that?\nKN: Like, as I said, the world is changing so much and there's so many and because we're consuming all this knowledge and we're exposed to it, it's naturally on the forefront of everyone's mind. And I do think these talent teams, people teams, have a responsibility to bring all that together and collectively say, work with senior managers of a business to decide, how are we going to address these things? But like any business objective, it comes down to prioritising some of them. Now that doesn't mean, do we prioritise profitability over people related topics? It means which of the topics can we tackle right now, that concern the wellbeing of our staff and partnering with managers to understand, this is how collectively we are going to do this as a business. And this is why I'm a big believer in thinking that actually, you do need these talent teams within a business, because they are the ones that are championing, what is, what's going to be on the agenda and working with the managers on how we actually bring this to life and embed it within the business. But it's not done by the talent team going out and doing that independently, it's done by educating managers, it's done by working out how to actually embed that within each distinct team in the business.\nNC: So, this talent team you talk about, are they within human resources or are they essentially part of the management?\nKN: Well, that's an interesting question. In my opinion they are a distinct team but, as I've said, their role is to partner with the manager, much in the same way that you would have a business coach. And this is the challenge, because I think some companies don't hire people in the role who are able to coach and advise and influence managers, but that is the skill that is needed for people within that team. Which to me is different from what is more typically known as HR and David used the example of a redundancy, and I think that's a really sort of nice example to use, not redundancy as in and of themselves, but the scenario. So when I've led redundancies, I would rely on my HR, the team that are specialists in understanding proper process, diligence, compliance, fairness and they will advise on how to do things. And then I've relied on this talent team to work with managers on how do you deliver this message, that's both compliant but has warmth and has humility and how do you then deal with the consequences of that? And this is a really nice example of how it's done, but to me why it's important that they're completely different teams. I'd put that in that HR team, more within, if it's not outsourced I'd be putting them within the legal and compliance teams.\nNC: Washika lots of points to take up there.\nWHS: I would disagree with this distinction between, whom does HR advise and support? Is it management or employee? In ideal case it's both. And then, coming back to what I wanted to say, David said it already, it's about delivering even the uncomfortable, unpleasant messages, but just what Kat was saying about the differentiation between HR and talent, this is a whole debate that's going on in academia, what is now talent management? Because to be very bold and frank, nobody really knows, still we have a lot of unanswered questions. But dividing HR in this technical and the more soft approach Kat was saying HR and talent management is nothing really new. We know about this for the past 30, 40 years, because we know that there is a hard approach in the field of HR and there is the soft approach as well. And what HR did over the course of the three decades is really to bring it together as close as possible, how could we merge this more technical expertise, with the soft skills of HR as well? And this is where we are at the moment and a lot of organisations get it really right and correct and, as I said, we need to elevate, we need to move forward within the profession as well. But again, the role of line managers and HR functions, nothing new as well, Dave Lowry from Michigan State University was talking about it for the past 20 years. And the forecast was, more and more responsibilities will be pushed towards line managers and this is exactly what happened, but HR managers, or line managers, are not equipped with the skills and competencies they need to deliver HR, or people management practices, or strategies. In my view we need a more decentralised HR function in support of line managers, because line managers are delivering on a day to day basis HR experiences, or employee experiences. But everything what was said up to now, it's not really new. We know it, we discussed it, we are fully aware of these distinctions, but the effort was always how to bring it together and not to divide it further.\nNC: And talking of trying to bring people together, David have you any thoughts about how you can bring people together and not get bogged down on these structures, but get HR working in a better way for the benefit of the organisation as a whole?\nDDS: So, I think it's highly contextual. And what I mean by that is, we're supposed to be the experts in helping organisations design structures and ways of working flows and understanding how people work best together. But actually, we need to turn that light on ourselves at times and think about the needs of the organisation at that phase and its growth or in the sector that it's in and the challenges that it's facing. And that's, historically would've been seen as an organisational development and design issue, how do you get the culture and the resources of the organisation set up to meet the external challenges? I think to Kat's point, it's very much in that space, but it is possible to have structures that are wildly different but work for their unique context. And that's where I think we need to keep pushing the agenda, so that we're not static, we're changing to the meeting needs, not just to the outside world but of different organisations. So, we saw in the pandemic, certainly in the UK, about 50% of people could work from home and about 50% of people still needed to go to their place of work. That means that actually thinking about things from the lens of a tech organisation for instance doesn't work, we need to think about the unique situation the organisation's in and design to and for that. And whether we call that OD, whether organisations looking at it in terms of people development, employee experience, or talent, however we label it, I think the job at hand is relatively consistent, how do you support the organisation best? In some organisations that might be supporting line managers more, in other organisations it might be appreciating that there are some things that they're going to need less help with over time, to ensure that they're building up the muscles to be able to deal with that.\nNC: I wonder whether Kat or Washika in turn can give us any ideas from their own experience of how they've tried to solve this and get people managers working better in the business.\nWHS: I personally worked with a couple of organisations where exactly this was the question on the table, how to move forward. And I can proudly say that there are some really successful examples where responsibilities people management. I'm talking less about HR technicalities like compliance, or governance, more about people management was pushed onto line managers, but at the same time there was a very active dynamic HR capabilities in an organisation. You can call it whatever you like, but important is what David was saying in the beginning, that you have these capabilities inhouse and these capabilities were available to line managers, to access to whenever there was a question. I think this could be one of the solutions. Another could be, to develop HR or help people managers to grow into the role of architects. What does it mean, that they will build networks, networks across the organisation where you really foster collaboration between line managers, employees, departments, so you really try to get rid of the silos and then it's not just internally. I think the next step for HR would be as well and I think Kat would hopefully agree with me, to connect with the outside external environment as well and to bring talent, to connect with talent or with expertise even outside of the organisation. And this is something I believe a lot of HR professionals work right now on it, how to make these, this connection happen, how to build this network of different contributors and the aim is, as David was saying, to help businesses to grow and to remain competitive.\nNC: Kat, does any of that resonate with you?\nKN: Yeah. Well actually, Nigel, I was going to answer your earlier question. What's interesting is I've worked with about two organisations that did not have, call it HR, talent, whatever you want to call it, but didn't have those teams and we made a conscious decision for that to happen. And that was to really up level managers, suddenly it became very, very clear that their role was to attract candidates, to hire well, to make sure that they were high performing, to keep them engaged, to keep them retained. And we made a strong message to say your role is to manage, therefore we are not going to put people in this role who are the top performers in the team and therefore, you're a top performer we're going to promote you into manager, we're going to put the people that are capable of doing the role into the management role. And that really opened the eyes to everyone, because suddenly people were like, gosh, like managing is hard, managing is a full time role. And then what happened is, once that culture was embedded, we actually did start to bring in some talent professionals into the business and it was received so openly and with such open arms, because it was suddenly like you know what, I need a coach, I need someone to partner me and help me, someone I can have a sparring partner with who can actually help me do this and do it better, but I'm not going to delegate my responsibility to you, it is my responsibility, but I want to be pushed and inspired to do it better. And I think that's a really interesting way for businesses to look at it.\nNC: David do you think one of the lessons from this discussion is that perhaps people managers could be better at both understanding the value they can bring to a business and so then spending time giving that message to people at every level of the organisation?\nDDS: So, there's an awful lot that lands on the shoulders of people managers in businesses and not all businesses are able to have that model that Kat described, where there's a clear separation between technical skills and day to day requirement, and the building of a team over a length of time. It is absolutely critical that the people fresh in HR gets better at supporting managers dependent on their context. We're doing a lot more guidance for line managers because actually even if you think about it from the other side, when things go terribly wrong, HR teams can it don't go brilliant, excellent, more work. They would've preferred people managers to be more expert in the time and avoided situations coming about. And actually the job's a lot easier as well if they're developing their people through and you've got a talent pipeline coming through the organisation and clear view of it. So, everyone should be pulling in the same direction, the balance of responsibilities between those two groups we just need to be really careful with. So there was a really interesting piece done by Leanne Judge a few years ago where she compared the expectations maybe the HR function ten or 20 years ago to what they are now and there's a range of things from counsellor to coach to legal expert, right the way through. Wellbeing, an idea we've seen absolutely shoot up the agenda now as well. If you want that range of complexity dealt with, it's very hard to do all of that in a systemic way through line management populations. That doesn't mean they're not critical but it does mean the support to them is critical and the understanding of how that complex system fits together is also critical.\nNC: Great and Washika I'd just like to go back to that story that Kat was telling us a moment ago, this novel idea of managers doing managing, this is still only aspirational for many, isn't it?\nWHS: I would go back and look at the educational background of those managers. Those managers are in those specific roles because they bring some technical expertise to the role. They are not necessarily educated in people management and looking back at my work now at Henley Business School where I'm responsible for a number of modules at the MBA and executive MBA level, those managers are coming to us and then we are delivering these modules which is called people management and they're fascinated, because they know that this is part of the job as well, but at the same time they're not very comfortable of doing it, because they lack the expertise. And I think moving forward it's, again, it's nothing really new here, we have these discussions now for the past, for sure two decades, on how could line managers take over people management responsibilities. But I think on the educational side, we need to make some changes.\nNC: OK. And David D'Souza, just trying to bring this discussion to some conclusion, change is nothing new in the profession, since the pandemic we know it's happened at breakneck speed, hasn't it? And as we saw at the CIPD Festival of Work, outsourcing solutions, new Wizzy Technology, it was all there and I wonder whether we should see all this as a new call for the profession to look at how it should best respond to changing needs to the global context, all this stuff that's going on. Maybe even delivering a bit of a riposte to its critics along the way.\nDDS: So, I think the profession will always be undervalued because it's easier to point out when it's going wrong and it's more attractive to point out when it's going wrong than when it's doing a great job. What I would say is, part of the job is constantly reinventing the, our proposition to make sure it's meeting the needs of organisations. So, and that involves looking at structures, that involves looking at technologies, but keeping at the centre of it, the importance of the work and the essential role that it plays for organisations. We can discuss and we should discuss different methods of delivery and different long term ambitions, but at the CIPD we talk about championing better working, working lives, fundamentally believing that work can be better for millions, if not billions of people. That's the problem we're trying to solve, there may be different ways of doing it and we should look at all of those options as we go along.\nNC: OK. So good thought to end on from you. Kat Navarro from your own experience, do people managers, human resources people have anything to fear from this change we are hearing about?\nKN: I think we should always be thinking we have something to fear because we should always be uplevelling ourselves. So absolutely. I think we all have to up our game managers and talent teams alike. It's not enough to just be doing the tasks that we're comfortable with. We need to be looking at how we can make, we talked earlier about how this is, this discussion has been happening for 20 years, I actually feel that the fact that we're having this discussion and we've been having it for 20 years is a really big concern to me. The fact that we're saying that we've got managers where this might be uncomfortable for them, frankly to me that's not good enough. I actually think if you're going to be in the role of a manager, you have to do the role of a manager. And therefore what we need from people in these talent teams, are people that have the expertise and the specialism to be able to advise and coach managers on how to do this better. So, they almost have to be super managers in order to be able to coach other managers. So, is uplevelling required? Yeah. And should people be fearful that maybe they need to upskill themselves? Then yes. But is that a bad thing? I don't think so.\nNC: So Washika, pretty blunt from Kat then, the fear factor keeping us on our toes.\nWHS: I agree. I agree 100%, because this brings HR again into the position, all right what can we do next? Because doing the same thing over a long period of time, this is not fun, but I think it's a good time for HR professionals to really redefine and reinvent themselves and their contributions to the organisation, absolutely. Fear? I wouldn't say fear, but it's more about being aware and being prepared and, yeah, developing a resilient to respond to what's coming next.\nNC: Well, what a brilliant eye-opening discussion this has been and we've touched on a lot of things people professionals almost dare not think about as they go about their daily duties. What have we learnt? Well, if the question is do we need an HR team, the response surely has to be, how can we find better ways to support and value the people function to have the impact that we want?

      "full_text": "Duration: 33:05\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: I'm Nigel Cassidy, and welcome to a slightly different episode of the CIPD Podcast. Last week the CIPD hosted it's Festival of Work at London Olympia. It was a two day conference bringing together thousands of people, professionals and business leaders to discuss the new world of work. For one of the sessions, I took to the stage to interview two special guests, the CIPD's own Digital Learning Portfolio Manager, Giorgia Gamba-Quilliam and Susi Miller, author of Designing Accessible Learning Content. Our conversation focused on learning, whether a one size fits all approach to learning is feasible, and the practicalities of designing adaptable, inclusive and vitally accessible learning experiences. In this episode, you'll get a chance to hear that conversation in full, or if you were at the festival, to hear it again. I hope you enjoy it.\nWell on behalf of the whole podcast team, fantastic to see so many of you joining us for this session. Really, this is all about whether you can box clever and design for everybody. Does one size really fit all when it comes to your learning and communication? And of course, we all know the reasons why this is incredibly important. One in five of the working population say they have a physical or psychological disability which may impede how they use materials, and I, I know there's a great desire in the whole HR community to do better with our digital communication. So our digital learning is failing in some areas, this session we hope will be incredibly practical in showing how it can be put right, how to fix it.\nWell welcome to the stage here at Olympia, alongside me the CIPD's own award winning Digital Learning Portfolio Manager, she's created content for high profile clients from the Liberal Democrats to the Red Cross, and she was on the team that launched the CIPD's own online platform Learning Hub, it's Giorgia Gamba-Quilliam, hello.\nGiorgia Gamba-Quilliam: Hi everyone.\nNC: It's brilliant to be out isn't it instead of working from home?\nGGQ: It is, I know, all these real people.\nNC: And we are both delighted to hear from a feted specialist in this field, she's author of the book, Designing Accessible Learning Content, which I know is on sale at the CIPD stand over there. A passionate advocate for digital accessibility, the founder and director of eLaHub, Susi Miller. So Susi, before get onto designing or redesigning, I was struck by how you make a distinction between accessibility and inclusivity. Because basically both terms are used and exchanges aren't they? Most people know they can follow all the guidelines that are out there to make their material, their online learning accessible. But does that mean that it's inclusive?\nSusi Miller: I think starting from accessibility is a great place to start, because I think a lot of us aren't, haven't actually started understanding what accessibility means and how to make our content accessible. So basically, I think accessibility quite often is seen as meeting the particular web content accessibility guidelines or standards. However I think it is possible to create a piece of learning which does tick all of the boxes, but it still isn't a great piece of learning, and for me that's where the, this idea of inclusivity comes in. If it's an inclusive experience, it's a welcoming, positive experience for everybody. So it's a good piece of learning which doesn't exclude anyone at all. So I think we were, as well as being accessible for everybody, making sure that there are no barriers which exclude anyone with any type of access needs, so it could be vision, hearing, motor or cognitive as we've discussed. It actually is, as I say, it's a great piece of learning experience. So it's as equally good for someone who is using assistive technology as it is for someone who isn't using assistive technology. And it also, it's also, the language that's used is inclusive, the imagery that's used is inclusive. So it's altogether a welcoming inclusive experience for everybody.\nNC: I've heard you give a great example about a restaurant ...\nSM: Yeah, so an example from one of the contributors that did a case study for my book, and she's recently released a video which explains the difference between accessibility and inclusion. And the example that she, that really struck me was the idea of a group of people going to a restaurant with someone who uses a wheelchair. And although the restaurant was accessible, in the video, all of the people who aren't using a wheelchair are, went into the main entrance and had their lovely welcoming experience. The wheelchair user was taken around the back of the restaurant, you know, dark alley, dustbins, people smoking, then through the kitchens, then past the toilets and then joined her friends. And for me, that was just kind of a lightbulb moment. Yes, it was an accessible experience, but it wasn't an inclusive experience. And then I suddenly thought, my goodness, that applies to learning as well, we can make learning accessible, we can tick all of the boxes, but what we really need to be, in an ideal world doing, is making it inclusive for everybody.\nNC: Giorgia, what's your take on the difference between these two?\nGGQ: Yeah, absolutely. Like, am I very loud? I am, OK. Like Susi just said, it's --\nNC: If in doubt, just plough on, that's what they told me.\nGGQ: OK, like Susi just said, it's also about thinking about what images and languages we use. So for example, if you don't see yourself represented in any of the images, if everybody in every image that you have is, I don't know, white for example, if you're not white then you wouldn't feel as included in there. If you don't see yourself represented then you don't feel so engaged. So I think that's also something to think about which makes, it goes beyond the accessibility requirement of having the whole text on the image. And same for the language, especially if you're going to produce global content like we do at CIPD, you want a language that is simple, not simplistic but simple so that it's easy for everybody to comprehend, no matter their background and their first language of whatever it might be. So there's a lot to think about when you want to go yeah, beyond accessibility requirement to really inclusive learning.\nNC: OK, so going a bit more into the detail now, it's such a big topic, and if you look online at guidelines, I mean they run to hundreds and hundreds of pages. So how do you start Susi in looking through your content and reimagining it so that it's useful for everybody without oversimplifying it or just cutting whole things out?\nSM: So I think understanding it and breaking it down, I think it does, when you, when you start tackling accessibility, I think one of, that is one of the major reasons that so many people just look at accessibility and think it's just too difficult, you know that it's, it is such a huge area and so there's so many different standards. So for me it is a question of coming up with a strategy and a way of accessing that. So for me, that's part of the reason that I wrote the book, because I just felt as a learning designer myself, I needed something that simplified it and allowed me to actually make it more accessible for me really. So --\nNC: And you've come out with some headings for people haven't you?\nSM: Yes, so the access needs you mean?\nNC: Yes.\nSM: Yeah, so either, for me it's like a, it could be a contextual framework as I came up with in the book, or for, for a lot of people, if you're trying to make, understand it yourself or trying to explain it to other people, then breaking it down into different access needs. So maybe thinking of vision access needs, hearing access needs, cognitive and motor access needs. And really understanding what you need to do for each of those categories, those lenses of access needs is a great place to start.\nNC: I just wondered if we could just ask our audience maybe, just on a show of hands, how many of you have either been tasked with making some improvements and been just not sure where to go next. I mean is this a problem? Interesting yes, about a dozen hands have gone up.\nGGQ: It's great to see.\nNC: So this is a familiar problem.\nGGQ: It is, yeah definitely.\nNC: Giorgia.\nGGQ: And I think to address it, it's really important to have the right people on the team. So our work as a content manager, so content is my expertise, but I couldn't really come out with an end result of a learning product that is really accessible and inclusive without the other members on my team, including instruction and designers. And people who really understand how to translate this into digital product that is accessible. So it's really important to have the right skills on the team. And our own research at CIPD has shown that actually, although investment in L&D has not gone down with the pandemic, the, the roles that have been hired or maintained on the teams are not necessarily all the roles that a team needs to be able to create this. It's a bit, it can be complex, but it can be done much better by professionals.\nNC: Now Susi Miller, I was in on a workshop you did before this podcast, and I'm just picking on one example here. You got a little exercise going and you showed how drag and drop is a very difficult thing, and you devised something in some of your own work to overcome this so that people could match things without physically moving them. But I could imagine a lot of senior managers for example, who are not familiar with making things more accessible. They might say, look, you're restricting me, you're telling me I can't do drag and drop, say I can't use audio because somebody might not be able to hear it. Or you might, in other words, how do you convince people that they can actually say what they want to, that they're not either patronising people or, at the other extreme, not providing materials that do the job?\nSM: So I think accessibility still is, in our particular industry, accessibility is interestingly kind of labelled as something that limits you. And obviously if you're passionate about accessibility like a lot of people are, then the more you find out about it, then the more you realise actually, if you make something accessible, it does become a better learning experience. If you're designing for everybody then it makes you think empathetically, it makes you think actually it's beneficial to people who have access needs for me to include captions and to include a transcript. But it's also beneficial for so many other people, so many other learners. So for me, accessibility adds to the learning rather than takes away. So I think when you're, when you were saying about, does it make it simplistic? So even just looking at plain language, sometimes people think, well you know, if, if I make the language plain, it's dumbing it down. And actually I think, the research is that everybody benefits from plain English, as you were saying before --\nGGQ: Yes.\nSM: A plain language. So it's the way that we read online, we skim and scan, so it's a different way of accessing content. So making it, simplifying it and saying things more, in fewer words is better for everybody.\nGGQ: Yeah. I totally agree, because it encourages creativity rather than taking away, like you were saying.\nSM: Yeah.\nGGQ: I was just working recently with actually in, an instructional designer and developer, and I was saying, I was explaining how I want to get something across in a course. And they said, oh the platform can't do this, but that, rather the conversation finishing there, it just encouraged him to think out of the box and come up with different solutions that they wouldn't maybe have thought about straight away. So yeah, it definitely encourages creativity and thinking out of the box.\nSM: When you compare what's happening in the learning and development sphere, and you compare that to advances in technology. In our, say for example, in the gamification industry, we've got games that are incredible accessible, that are doing incredible things, and yet we're still talking about drag and drops. You know, we've got games where, haptic technology, we've got, you can literally, the most accessible games are out there. And yet in our industry, we seem to be so far behind, we have the, as I say, the fact that accessibility limits rather than innovates and makes people think out of the box. So I think we need to change as an industry, and the tools also need to improve so that you have accessible versions of things which must be, I know some tools are really now pushing accessibility so that it's getting better.\nNC: Giorgia, you have a pretty good overview of the CIPD and what organisations are doing or trying to do. So can you give any advice on how you'll make a start? We saw from the show of hands from the audience, people do find this difficult. So do you have to assemble a team, do you need outside consultants necessarily?\nGGQ: Yeah, there's no one way to do it that is right. It depends very much of your, the size of your organisation, the context you work in. But certainly relying on the right expertise for the job is, is a good place to start. Now that might mean hiring someone or it might mean using a consultant, that is really very much dependent on the context. But certainly not expecting that anyone with an L&D role, any kind of L&D role must know everything about all of this, because, yeah, it's impossible basically.\nNC: So Susi, talk us through the practicalities of bringing a new design. Clearly you've a lot of experience of doing this, you know the right people to talk to. But how would you make a start in an organisation?\nSM: Quite often it starts, the seed quite often starts with a person in an L&D role, it certainly was the case in mine that I just, there are people who are creating content who are feeling it's not, this is not right that I do not know how to make it accessible. I want my content to be accessible for everybody, and that's the germ. And then for it, for me to be successful, it needs to have that leadership support, it needs to, but very often it starts at grass roots level. And there's, there is nothing wrong with that at all, for me that's the power behind accessibility, and that's really why I wrote the book was because I felt, I found it so difficult that there were so many times that I nearly gave up. But I thought, OK, all of the work that I'm doing, I want to share. So I, I think that it's got the power of, of someone really passionate, can at least go and understand it from that point of, not that I'm trying to promote the book, but I, it's just, it's just where I started.\nNC: I was about to say other books are available, but I'm not sure whether they are on this exact subject.\nSM: I don't think they are at the moment, but they may be soon. But the most important thing, for it to be, become embedded in an organisation is that it doesn't stop at that grass roots level, and that it --\nGGQ: Yeah, I totally agree. I think not everybody maybe can do the technical side of it, and you do need the right professions for that. But everybody can be an advocate of it and really make the case for it and talk to their colleagues and the leadership and say, well we, as an organisation we don't want to accept that we create something that is not accessible.\nNC: Is there an element of needing sometimes to convince senior managers that these are changes for the better? Because I can imagine somebody saying, look, our materials are readily understood by 80%, by all the people in this business area, why should we compromise in design for the 20% who have difficulties? How do you argue that one size fits all wherever possible it is just so much better?\nGGQ: Well it's not about compromising, like we, both Susi and I were saying, it's about making something better for everybody. So it's really not writing for the 20% or creating for the 20% but for the 100%. And yeah, maybe the 80% might be able to access what we do. But really, do we have any hard evidence of that either? Because a lot of disabilities are hidden, a lot of people don't want to share their own disabilities. So we're making huge assumptions about the number of people who can access what we're producing. So if we make the most possible accessible thing, then that's when we reach the --\nNC: Can you not find out about that? How do you know that your materials aren't hitting the spot? That people are, are just having difficulties every time they run a programme or something?\nGGQ: Yeah of course, you can find out by asking your own people through surveys, through a HR system by collecting internal data. But I'm not sure that that many people do it. But even if you do do it, some people might not want to disclose some information about themselves. So it's better to have something that is for everybody rather than assuming that people can access it.\nNC: You're saying it's better to have something for everybody?\nGGQ: Yes.\nNC: Yes.\nSM: Can I add to that as well then?\nNC: Yes.\nSM: We also, we are also accommodating people who have, so you're talking about people with permanent access needs. But the huge, you know, if you, if you think about people who have temporary and situational access needs, if you think about the ageing population, if you think about people who are not happy, you know, are not comfortable disclosing a disability, but also people who are not, have not a diagnosed disability. So for me, for many years I suspected that I was dyslexic, but a lot of people have got neurodiversity or neurodivergent traits and haven't been diagnosed with them. So, but those are, and that for me, the, that whole neurodivergent, the neurodiversity angle is, is really, really important.\nGGQ: Yeah, it's also about easiness of access isn't it? For example, if you're looking at a video and you haven't got any physical impediments to be able to see it, but you're in a public space, you're in a noisy space or on a bus, you don't want to listen to it, you want to be able to read captions or read a transcript. So some, yeah, that's why I'm saying something that's more accessible makes life easier for everybody, even if it, physically you don't have any issues accessing that content.\nNC: We talked a lot about accessibility, what about the other areas that are becoming more important. Are, is there a sense that it actually, for an organisation that wants to do the right thing, there's more stuff that people should be considering, which isn't even necessarily part of their kind of formal agenda if you like?\nGGQ: Yeah, it's not just a question of accessibility. Obviously we talked a lot about digital accessibility, but there are a lot of considerations to do for also when people can access content. So in that respect, it's just the content can open up accessibility to a lot of people who couldn't potentially travel to a place to access learning or access at specific times, if it's self learning, obviously digital learning can be also delivered in real time. But if it's there accessible at all time in the floor work when you need it, where you need it, it opens up to a lot of people who might not be able to, for care and responsibility because of the nature of the job. Or even because they're career transitioning, they don't want to tell their current employer that they're learning something different. So there is a variety, an infinite variety of people and reasons why we access content and training that makes it worthwhile to have it as flexible as possible.\nNC: Susi, how scary are all the official guidelines if you like online? I mean there's, you, again at you workshop you were demonstrating there's applications you can do to check your colour contrast, there is massive, long documents about language. People might find this task, as we were saying earlier, a bit scary.\nSM: So I think it's the driver really behind trying to decide what your strategy is. So I think if your organisation for example is a public sector body, then you need to be more aware of the guidelines. Because you have a legal duty under the public sector body's accessibility regulations to be making your content accessible to the web content accessibility guidelines. Very, Version 2.1 Level A and AA, so that gives you a very clear framework. Under the Equality Act, every organisation has an anticipatory duty to make their content, to provide reasonable adjustments. And from the point of view of what that means for digital content, then the underpinning best practice are those guidelines, that was really I think cemented in, into law by the public sector bodies. And even organisations who aren't public sector bodies for best practice should be meeting those international guidelines. From a pragmatic point of view, it is difficult, particularly in learning content, to always meet every single guideline. And my best piece of advice really that I give to clients is, one of the requirements actually of the public sector bodies is that you provide an accessibility statement. Now that is, as I say, a legal requirement. But for me, as a learning designer and developer, it is such a beneficial thing to provide to my learners, and to also allow me to basically address any constraints. So not all, not everything that I want to do or am able to do as a learning designed and developer may fit. So sometimes I might have constraints because my organisation needs me, or I'm working with clients who want a particular thing. But if I have the option of having an accessibility statement, I can tell learners up front that this is, within this learning, it meets the majority of the requirements, however, for a particular reason, I may not be able to meet everything. So for me, what's happened in the past is because, as you say, it can seem so scary that people just, they kind of want to bury their heads in the sand and they don't feel confident. For me this idea of having an accessibility statement is a really beneficial way of helping learners, and also allowing you to acknowledge that there are constraints, it's not possible always to meet every single one of the requirements.\nGGQ: Yeah, that's such a good point. Obviously don't make perfect be the enemy of good. So if you can make some improvements, it's better than doing nothing. And sometimes I feel, if you feel overwhelmed by the, all these regulations, you might just want to give up altogether. But it's still better to take baby steps and do something rather than just not attempting any improvement at all.\nSM: So there's one phrase that's actually going on on social media at the moment about accessibility which is progress over perfection. And I love that, because I really think if you accept it isn't always possible to make everything 100% compliant, but you just, as you said, your baby steps, you're just making a bit of progress. It has a huge, huge impact on people and we don't --\nNC: And indeed the people in this room have that responsibility, I can see people writing that down as you said it. We're almost coming to the end, we have got time for a few questions. Who would like to ask a question. One at the front here.\nAudience 1: Thank you. My question is relating to the fact that with the pandemic and us becoming very, very digital, some companies and public sector as you mentioned Susi, they've, it's light years in how we've developed and adopted technology. But we have very diverse needs, just if you point to the generations we have in the workforce. So how can we confidently say that we need help? We need to, the support to even access some of this learning and development. Or just being able to use anything to be effective, so --\nNC: And when you say we need help, you mean the L&D community or ...\nA1: The collective, oh yeah the L&D but even, L&D community is there to help our staff so for everyone. So yeah.\nNC: Sure, and of course, so many things have just grown like topsy haven't they during the pandemic? We've got all this hybrid working, rather kind of mixed solutions, some very successful, some not.\nGGQ: Yes, I mean what, what's been out there has been a mix, hit and miss sometimes. But I think it's important to develop ourselves of course as L&D professionals. There's been loads of research in the past years that shows we're the last one to look after ourselves. But yeah, we cannot be expected to improve and to learn more and to do better without our own developments put in place as well. So I think there's a really good case to be made for L&D people to also be developed and keep developing. And also role modelling in that way, after all we're asking everybody else to do it, so we need to do it ourselves as well.\nNC: And maybe Susi more intelligent conversations with users?\nSM: Yeah, so, in what way?\nNC: Well in the sense that, I mean the question from the floor suggested that solutions are lacking sometimes.\nSM: OK.\nNC: And you wonder, how would anybody know even?\nSM: OK.\nNC: They need to talk to the people who are using the training and systems.\nSM: Yeah, definitely yes. And for me I think that the one, the huge benefit really of what happened when everything suddenly went digital, for me there was a real strong feeling of empathy because everybody was in the same situation. And for me, from an accessibility point of view, that was where the temporary and the situational kind of aspect really came to life. People understood how difficult it was to be working in an environment where you were home schooling children and you maybe didn't have the, you had old computer equipment, you didn't have the right you know? So that was, that's that bit I hope we don't lose, because we really did understand and we could empathise with what other people were going through in that situation. And I think to carry that learning on and to really feed it into everything we do is a key learning for me.\nNC: Another question here.\nAudience 2: Susi you, from what you were saying, it sounds like the ideal thing to do when you're creating digital learning or other forms of learning resources or programmes, it's the building that inclusive experience for everyone from the start.\nSM: Yeah.\nA2: But in a world of finite resources and time and everything else, what are some quick wins or tips that you might point us to where we can adapt existing learning even if it might be a bit outdated?\nSM: So I think a really good starting point is to, is to have a strategy before you begin. So I think there's, in an ideal world I would say, if you think accessibly at the beginning rather than shoe horning it in at the end, and that's the issue that we have quite a lot. Because we, our mindset is we get to the end of the project and we think, oh, it's got to be accessible. And then, then it's, as you say, and a lot of people have a lot of legacy content that does need to be, that needs to be remediated. So I think there's two different strategies. I think with new content, it is understanding more about accessibility and building it in upfront. And that really does, if you, if your whole design process is inclusive, it really does, you know as the saying that, accessibility isn't more work, you were just cutting corners before, you were just, you weren't doing it properly kind of thing. But if, a lot of us in the situation where we have got existing work, then I think there's a strategy. So my, the, my best piece of advice is to first of all look at that body of work and decide, prioritise what is upfront that you need to look at. And then maybe come up with 20 things that you can do easily. So it is things like adding, making sure that you've got captions, it's that colour content, it's the language, it's that you haven't got things, the moving content. So there's a whole, a whole load of tips, I've got some leaflets actually that I'll hand out that have got 20 tips in them, that for me is my starting point.\nA2: OK.\nSM: And also you can access that online for --\nNC: Brilliant, and I'm sure those could be made available --\nSM: Yes they will, yeah.\nNC: For people who are listening to the podcast. One more quick comment or question from the floor, woman in the front.\nAudience 3: Hi I'm interested about the skill set, you were talking about having the right team around you, what would you say are the key skills that people need to have to be able to design content to meet accessibility and inclusivity?\nNC: Yeah, good question, not everybody can do this can they?\nGGQ: Well I guess everybody could do it if they want to learn about it. But not everybody might want to do that. It's a long training to learn, but yeah, it, it's more about the mixture of the team members that you have. So I would definitely an instructional designer and a developer or learning technologist if you, we're talking about digital learning. Because yeah, they translate --\nNC: That's quite a formal way of looking at it --\nGGQ: It is yeah, I'm --\nNC: I wonder whether the questioner meant what kind of soft skills, who's good at creating --\nGGQ: Yeah.\nNC: Great content that works for everybody?\nGGQ: Yeah well you have to know about, at least a little bit about learning, which I guess you would know if you work in L&D. The principles actually about how people learn are not different from how they learn face to face or digitally. So things like not overloading the amount of content for example, or presenting it in a clear flow following the logical flow that makes sense. And building on information, building on what people know already. All these kind of principles make good learning, they also make good online learning. So I think as a L&D professional, a lot of us know these things already, but then when we come to translate it online, there are additional considerations to be made. And that's when, if we can, it's good to rely on other professionals as well. But if we start from the principles and the things that we already know, we're half way there already.\nSM: I think from the accessibility point of view, if you have the, the advantage of having someone who has a lived experience of a disability is phenomenal. And I think that we quite often, because a lot of people in an organisation sometimes, they don't feel comfortable saying that they have got, for example, particularly with neurodiversity. So quite often I find that people I'm working with in L&D, I don't know whether it's because of empathy or that they may, they have that experience. My own experience of working for example with a screen reader user who's blind and has had, been using it for years, who also has an L&D background is absolutely phenomenal. Because she gives me the perspective, not, of not only does it tick the boxes but whether it's a good user experience for her. And if, and coming back to the idea of inclusive learning, if I come up with a piece of learning that she says, it works with a screen reader her, only obviously one aspect, but if it works with a, her assisted technology, but it's a good piece of learning, for me that's the accolade. That is what tells me it's a piece of inclusive learning, not just an accessible piece of learning.\nNC: Yeah.\nGGQ: Yeah, I think if you create content for people that you know, learning content for people that you know and you can ask, that's definitely always a great starting point. Sometimes you create pieces of learning that you don't know who going to actually utilise and access, and that's a bit more challenging maybe. But certainly, if you create for your own employees for example, colleagues, then definitely start by asking what works for them.\nNC: So test it out on people. Well we've had some fantastic answers from both of you, so thank you very much. And thank, thanks to everybody who's attended this session.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:32:20\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Organisations everywhere are struggling to build inclusive and diverse workforces, so is it time we turned to technology to help us with this very human workplace challenge? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNow the benefits of a diverse workforce where all are valued and able to participate are unarguable, not just because it's the right thing to do for social justice, but for the business. To broaden your talent base, boost creativity, innovate more and keep staff longer. So it is a stain on employers and people managers that in spite of all the policies and promises progress is slow or stagnant. What's the answer? Well this month's podcast asks, could digital technology be an unexpected friend in creating fairer, more equal and inclusive workplaces? To help us, three top guests in the field, joining us from Chicago in the United States, the Head of Belonging, Diversity and Inclusion Solutions for Cloud software providers, Workday, he says he strives to shatter and disrupt biases through a digital lens. It's Kevin McFall. Hello.\nKevin McFall: Hello Nigel. It is a pleasure to be here with you today.\nNC: Great, you're very welcome. From the home team we have the CIPD's own senior research advisor in data technology and AI, with a background in both IT and HR, she has a deep interest in how the people profession can contribute to good work through technology. She's Hayfa Mohdzaini. Hello.\nHayfa Mohdzaini: Hello Nigel.\nNC: But let's kick off with Dr Zara Nanu, who tells us that she founded her company on learning from the World Economic Forum that it would take 217 years for the gender pay gap to close. Gap Square helps clients measure and end unfair pay. Hi Zara.\nZara Nanu: Hi, hi Nigel.\nNC: Now before we get stuck into possible tech solutions, I wondered if you could give us a bit of a sense of our mission here. I mean, where do the fails lie in organisations that are just not getting to grips with unfairness of all kinds?\nZN: So unfairness at an organisation is something we've inherited, the world of work as we know it with current jobs and the way the jobs are structured, have been built mostly in a post second world war structure, where men were kind of at the helm of economies and of organisations and companies. And we've inherited that system where certain jobs are valued in a certain way and we find ourselves in a world where for instance, nurses get paid a certain wage whereas software engineers, or engineers altogether get paid a completely different wage, much higher than that. And we have an economy where occupations that are dominated by women tend to be less paid than occupations that are dominated by men. And in addition to that, we have less women in senior leadership work and also more women in support roles within organisations.\nNC: And Hayfa, of course it's not just about pay gaps, be they ethnic pay gaps or gender pay gaps, it's about organisations really not being fair across the piece, isn't it?\nHM: Yeah there's a whole range of areas that organisations could do to make the process fairer. All the way from the attractional through to retaining and when they leave the organisation. So for example when you are attracting people, pay attention to what words you use, where you're advertising, so what algorithms are used to advertise it, we then come in the organisation reviewing the pay gaps of course and understanding the staff surveys, what the feedback is and also when people get promoted, understanding who gets promoted, what the demographics are. And basically taking action. So we have a lot of data we can work on and it's just wanting to take action and monitoring progress. That's the bit I think that is lacking in organisations.\nNC: Now Kevin McFall, it does sound a bit counter intuitive doesn't it, to turn to technology to solve this very human issue about how you treat people? So can you talk us through how tech can help?\nKM: Certainly and it would seem somewhat counter intuitive, but what I think is an important take away is the understanding that it is an opportunity to augment the processes of assisting organisations to identify the issues that exist and then measure what their performance is against their intention and ultimately take action. And that is where the technology really helps. Being able to guide the right actions for organisations to take, not just for the business imperatives that rely on being in compliance with government regulations and such, but also to foster greater cultures for employee belonging and inclusion efforts that will help improve the business overall.\nNC: And to do that Zara, how much technology are organisations typically using at the moment? Obviously there's a huge difference between multi nationals and a small company with its tiny HR department, but broadly where are we using technology and where could we use it?\nZN: We find in working with organisations that the HR departments in particular are less, are using less innovative technologies than other departments. You have high use of tech in business development, in marketing and in all kind of digital approaches to growing a business and less so when it comes to HR. When the World Economic Forum is telling us that we are 260 years away from achieving gender parity, at the same time the World Economic Forum is telling us that us three will likely be in self driving cars by 2030 and NASA is telling us we'll be waving people off to Mars by 2030. So technological advancements are happening all around us, that they're just not currently utilised in an innovative way to help us address things like pay equity and overall diversity, equality and inclusion at work.\nNC: Now Hayfa, is this about using people analytics? I've seen this phrase often, I would imagine that being able to look at what's happening by job, location, department and manager is huge, but it's an awful lot of steps on the way to actually knowing what software, what platforms you need to start logging the right information and then acting on it. Where do you start with scaling up and seeing where technology might be able to help you do better?\nHM: I think Kevin made a really good point earlier that technology can augment our ability to know where to start and where to prioritise. So looking at what data we have in the organisation and what tools we have to pull that data. So your HR systems, how easy is it to pull out your regular pay gap reports, is it a huge industry to do that? And if so, maybe it's time to shop around for new tools that make it easier. So anything that you are going to need to regularly pull the same questions again is actually a candidate for something you probably want to automate or have a system that you can easily pull out that data.\nNC: OK so let's take that on a bit more with Kevin, let's go through the, there's so many things that people managers have to do in the course of their work, but let's start with people joining the company with fair selection, how can technology help us have a more diverse range of people working for the company?\nKM: I think the key component there is removing biases from the talent acquisition processes. The ability to ensure that various bias considerations that tend to seep into the recruitment process there can be interventions for those as well as best practices around talent acquisition. So for example, ensuring that interview processes consist of diverse panels of interviewers can help enable the removal of one subjective hiring decision maker from the process. So when you start with a set of opportunities that at least reduce bias in the selection process, you have a higher propensity of moving more diverse candidates through the talent acquisition funnel. And so technology can enable some of that process, but it's also about the people involved. So your recruitment and talent acquisition tools can certainly ensure that you have job descriptions that are inclusive in nature and there is technology that helps scan those job descriptions to ensure that that's reflected, but ultimately, I think you also have to ensure that you have interventions to help your recruiters and others in that hiring process, mitigate and reduce the bias associated with how they perceive talent.\nZN: What I would love to add to this, research shows that a 50/50 shortlist does not necessarily result in a 50% chance of a female candidate being recruited for that role. So we have to be extra kind of, doing, going the extra mile in terms of ensuring that shortlist is really diverse to ensure the recruitment of diverse talent and --\nNC: But what's that got to do with technology, that's just a human thing of going through is it? Or what?\nZN: Well so we, as a company that uses tech to create more equity at work and more fairness at work, we've resorted to using a piece of software ourselves for recruiting talent for our own organisation. So we've moved away in the early years from looking at CVs, even when we anonymised CVs we ended up having very similar candidates, because biases do come in when you look at someone's address, when you look at someone's education, when you look at someone's previous work experience. So we started using software that was just focussed on asking some questions of the candidate and would really highlight more where the learning skills of that candidate are and kind of approach to different situations. And so candidates would answer different questions and then we would have a committee that would score those answers, but you get the answers in a random order, so you can never piece one person together. So if someone says, when I went to Oxford I did this, what tended to happen that answer gets a lot of ten points out of ten. If they never mention Oxford again in any of the other questions, they may get twos they may get ones, so altogether it's easier to end up with a very diverse candidate pool at interview stage.\nNC: I want to go to Hayfa on this, but let me just ask you Zara, you were telling me when we spoke briefly beforehand about, was it Amazon or somebody and how their selection produced some rather curious and very unwanted effects?\nZN: Yeah there was this case that made the headlines a few years ago, where a handful of data scientists in Edinburgh were tasked by Amazon to put together a piece of software and help them identify top engineers around the world to join the company. And what happened as a result of that, was a piece of software that was discriminating against anyone who had the word woman in their CV. And ultimately when we revert to technology and we start using data and tech, we actually have to be careful about bias even more than we are about our own internal biases, because what data we put in, that's the data the software will analyse and make conclusions and in that instance that piece of software concluded that anyone with the word woman in their CV or LinkedIn profile, wasn't a good candidate for Amazon.\nHM: So getting a system that's not biased is not an easy thing to do and thus we can easily pull out examples, oh and this is why we shouldn't be using tech. But I think if we're a bit more patient and try to work with the text, we could iron out all those potential biases that seep in, so it is like probably we're looking at an immature solution that perhaps might be reliable in the next few years. So where tech can help in achieving a fairness is, as been picked up earlier, it is about being able to filter in thousands more applications so that you end up with a more diverse workforce. And the thing is, you can have all these checks and balances beforehand, but if the final decision maker, the humans, have not really moved on and they're still quite biased you would still not be able to iron it out. So it is actually both ways, we can design the tech to help the processes to achieve that diverse workforce, but at the same time we do need to train our managers to be able to be, to think more inclusively, to think about how can we achieve an organisation that's diverse? Yes.\nNC: On a simple level with that example, you would think people might have noticed that there were no women on the list --\nHM: Yeah.\nNC: You don't need a computer to do that. But I did see this thing that the UK government said very, very recently, it was the reason they gave for not having mandatory reporting on ethnicity as well as pay gaps and what they said, quoting a report was, there are significant statistical and data issues that would arise as a result of substituting a binary protected characteristic, male or female, with a characteristic that has multiple categories. I guess you might say this is, this might be construed as an excuse, but it does show that this is a really complex area isn't it, knowing what questions to ask and then how to process what comes out?\nHM:  Yeah for something like ethnicity pay gap it's, I guess, difficult to institutionalise what is a fair set of measures? But that's not an excuse for not doing it at an organisational level, even though the government like might not feel that's the right time to do it. So if it's something that's important in your organisation by all means carry on. Because I know there are organisations who are already doing ethnicity pay gap reporting, even before the, it's been consulted by the government. You touched earlier Nigel about other ways we could be more inclusive in the organisations, apart from just looking at the analytics. So there are tools around us that we can, we can use already to be more inclusive, for example like we are having this team, this meeting in Zoom, there are video calls that allow live transcription which would make a meeting for people who are hard of hearing more inclusive, they can join in meetings like this. So it's just looking around and being critical and saying, OK, well we want to make this, our workplace more diverse, more inclusive, what in the workplace, well how can we make, how can we do that, how can we make small changes in our workplace to make that happen?\nNC: Let's ask Kevin about that, because this is a kind of hidden bias, a hidden unfairness within an organisation and it's a long way from just meeting an obvious obligation not to discriminate.\nKM: I wanted to add that one of the emerging technologies that companies should be thinking about and ultimately adopting, is also that of skills based sourcing and skills based matching to their job requirements, with a movement towards skills as a source of professional capital if you will. It's not necessarily going to eliminate those instances of referring to the other attributes that tend to influence the bias of a hiring manager, but at least in sourcing and again moving through the talent acquisition pipeline, the focus on skills enables a higher confidence among organisations that they have the right people, for the right need, at the right time. And so I certainly know that our organisation is creating solutions that help managers ensure that they use and put skills matching at the centre of a lot of this work.\nNC: Well Zara's organisation does similar things I guess, though perhaps a bit more in the pay area. But just give us a sense of when you go into an organisation Zara, what sort of an issue, because they probably don't come to you and say, let's buy another piece of technology. So how do you assess where there are issues of unfairness of any kind and then work out what technology might help them improve their performance?\nZN: It's really interesting Nigel, I was just reading a book actually called, it's a new book called Work Without Jobs and actually speaks to a lot of the things that Kevin was talking about and how we need to look at deconstructing skills and deconstructing jobs themselves, because jobs are changing all the time. You recruit someone into a digital marketing role, two years down the line that role is going to look completely different, because technology is changing and reshaping everything about our work. So you need to link skills into that and focus on talent and how talent can actually pick up on those new skills and grow and develop as the world of work changes too. But I guess this is where it becomes really complex for organisations to understand how they can create fairness within all those roles. We've seen the cases that ended up in employment tribunal in the UK from supermarkets where people at the checkouts were being paid differently from people in the warehouse and they won the case against the employer on the grounds of equal pay for equal value. So when you start looking at things like that, like what does equal value mean? How are jobs changing to ensure that you remunerate that equal value across jobs at all times? It becomes really complex to do it on an excel spreadsheet. So you need to start looking and unpicking issues more in depth and we use our software to do statistical regression models and really help employers understand where they may be paying some employees unfairly, even though they have the same skills, they bring the same value, they perform the same tasks within a job and they have the same experience. And where for instance, some gaps can be justified by things like location, so someone who's in London will be paid differently than someone who's in Bristol and get a more in depth picture. As Kevin was saying earlier, it's about understanding the benchmark and understanding where then you're going to go from that benchmark, where you can remediate and where you can actually plan more successfully from a financial point of view, from a talent point of view, for the future workforce.\nNC: OK and Hayfa, assuming you've decided that you are going to try and gather and use more data to inform you in changing how people are managed and looked after and all that, do you always need expensive extra software to do that? Where does the tech come from and how do you learn how to use it effectively?\nHM: Well first start looking around in the company what you've got, so what software have you got, does it do the job well? What's the skills level in your department to be able to analyse that job, because the more skilled you are the more complex tools you can use. And then decide, OK do we need to invest in new software, or can we just repurpose what we've got?\nNC: OK and Kevin, once you've got a picture of what maybe diversity is looking like in your organisation, you begin to know how departments work, how people are treated and you start addressing it, you still maybe don't know if that's good, just OK, or if in need of some work. It sounds odd, do you need to benchmark your performance or is it just very obvious doing the right thing?\nKM: Oh that's a great question. Because one of the things that is important that we're finding is building a sense of community around these issues and understanding what corporate peers are doing within their workforce planning efforts.\nNC: Because of course you can't always tell if you look at their website, or you look at their reports, they often paint themselves in glowing colours as to what they're doing and as I said right at the beginning, the problem seems to be in the execution and people aren't living up to what they're promising to do.\nKM: Yes. That too has been a challenge and again, when I talk about community, I'm talking about these safe spaces that organisations are coming together to share and exchange best practices, challenges and in some instances how they're overcoming these challenges. At Workday we say, we want to make a better Workday for all and that mantra is certainly fostered in the solutions that are created, but it's also fostered through the community opportunities, community building opportunities that we create. So that there is a sharing among chief human resource officers and chief diversity officers and H officers and HRIS professionals that have an understanding. We have a great instance of a customer in the information services industry that began a campaign around ensuring that their workforce was confident and comfortable in sharing who they were in terms of their identities. So that they could self identify themselves within the HRIS systems giving this organisation that baseline data to being to analyse and derive insights and benchmark, so that they had that level setting and set goals and objectives of what they needed to improve upon and what, where they wanted to go ultimately in terms of thriving, having a thriving culture that fostered diverse equity and inclusiveness. There's no panacea of course around this, but I think it was said earlier that, you must at least have a goal and objective in trying to achieve a better workforce.\nNC: Zara it was interesting that Kevin mentioned diversity inclusion officers, people who professionally look at all these issues. Is there a danger that you can do quite a lot with these people analytics and everything, but because the senior managers didn't commission that, they don't own it?\nZN: Absolutely, there is that danger, but Kevin also mentioned the magic word and that's community and in a similar way you want to mobilise community within organisations and support people to be themselves and disclose their identities, you need community around these pieces of tech to help you really foster and implement that diversity and inclusion. So the fact that we have a piece of software that you click a button and it tells you where for instance you have pay inequities, or where there's a glass ceiling and women aren't making progress above a certain level, you need a community around that, that includes your rewards specialist, that includes your HR manager, that includes your diversity and inclusion person, that includes the CEO and people from the C Suite and the board room so that they can really own this and really understand what the software is telling them and pick up on those action points and take them forward. This is not just the job of someone who does people analytics, or software, it's everyone's job to make it work.\nHM: So I agree with what Kevin and Zara said, I think you need a support from all levels to mobilise and create an inclusive and diverse workplace, it is not just HRs job, it's not just the CEOs job, it's everyone's job.\nNC: And you don't see any dangers in the tech, the doing a job, pointing things out but not winning hearts and minds, that it's a, it becomes a process?\nHM: That's an interesting question because in some cases, I said at the beginning in this particular case tech can augment our ability to achieve an inclusive and diverse workplace, but if not everyone's bought in, you could put in processes to say, OK we will look at this data on a regular basis and then we will show you some quick wins and then through the quick wins you gradually win the hearts and minds of small clusters of people. And over time, as people see progress, people buy into it. So sometimes you do need to have that process of actually being, actively looking into it, to win the hearts and minds of people. We can't just talk about it and expect people to immediately buy in, you need to convince them.\nNC: And Kevin I was struck by something you wrote about your own father's life and purpose, I don't know if this was in Chicago, but trying to diversify the engineering profession there at the time and I wonder if you've ever thought about whether he would have approved of reliance on software for us to behave better?\nKM: I appreciate the reference to my late father, he certainly was a pioneering figure in ensuring that stem opportunities were made available to both women and other underrepresented groups. And I think he at some point was looking for additional support and as a scientist himself, I think he believed that technology could augment and support some of those efforts. But it really does start with people and a need to ensure that, technology ultimately again can be an aid but is not the silver bullet. One of the things that I believe today is, our current generation of new entrants to the workforce are particularly demanding that organisations do better, right? And whether those organisations adopt technology to do better, or the perceptions and the practices of the people change, I think the forces are all there to enact a different outcome.\nNC: Which I suppose Zara only goes to show that organisations in the UK shouldn't breathe a sigh of relief because they don't have to do the ethnicity pay gap reporting, because somebody who might want to work for them will be looking for that information, it's not just about compliance is it? Even though HR people seem to have to spend an inordinate amount of time on it.\nZN: Oh absolutely, this is not just a tick box exercise on compliance, the younger generations that are coming into the workplace, they're very much interested in that fairness across pay, across promotion levels, across representation in different occupations and seniority levels. So they are looking at this data and they're asking questions. I think over 70% of new and post grad employees were asking employers about what their diversity and inclusion policies are. They are looking on websites like Glassdoor in the US, websites like BuildIT, Blind and a few others where they're finding a lot of information about how much people had offered for certain jobs and for certain levels and career progression, so that they can understand better where the organisation sits with the fairness agenda.\nNC: OK, well we're coming to the end of our time, so just quickly before we finish, from each of you maybe just a quick thought to bring this together, where can you start to maybe deploy a bit more technology and avoid the pitfalls on this agenda?\nHM: Definitely look at the diversity figures by different groups of people, so not just looking at the average across an organisation, look by departments, by grades, by seniority, that kind of thing. If you're finding it's a bit of an industry trying to analyse all that, definitely look to software to see whether it can simplify that work for you, so that you can focus on convincing the employee population to make, to do something about it, to convince the managers, to convince the senior people to do something about it.\nKM: We have an approach at Workday, we call it VIBE, valuing, inclusion, belonging and equity for all. And in that approach, we definitely look across the entire employment life cycle but encourage beginning at the data collection and the talent sourcing point to ensure that you begin along what we also call as the VIBE maturity model in which you're committing your organisation to improvement. And from there you would move to drive and then ultimately, hopefully, having an organisation that thrives around that VIBE model.\nZN: This is a big issue and sometimes it can be overwhelming, you look at all those data points, you look at pay, you look at attrition levels, career progression, it can become really big and then once you start looking at size, tech and engineering, you see that not a lot of women are in the talent pipeline anyways and all of a sudden it becomes like this big mountain that you have to climb. And I think the key to addressing this mountain is taking small steps, so doing a very small data analysis over, for a department, just looking at a department, or just looking at the team and slowly growing from there will help us get on top of that mountain.\nNC: Great, well let me just thank Workday's Kevin McFall, Zara Nanu, founder of Gap Square and the CIPD's own Hayfa Mohdzaini for that excellent insight. Now the CIPD website has a really good factsheet and a thoughtful report on building an inclusive workplace and it's also got a clever health checker that you can use which tailor's ideas for your particular situation. Lots of positive comments on social about our previous and still very current podcast, just when you thought work pressure might be a bit much, we explained how a measure of good stress, just outside your team's comfort zone, could be just the thing to get the job done. So do check that out. And become a subscriber wherever you get your podcast because you'll be alerted to our forthcoming bonus edition, we hope to be recording live with an audience at the CIPD's Festival of Work at Olympia.

      "description": "Episode 182: We often view pressure at work as negative, something to be avoided at all costs. But is eliminating all stress really a good thing when it comes to optimising employee performance?",
      "summary": "Dealing with stress can place immense demands on employees’ physical and mental health. Our Health and Wellbeing at Work 2022 report emphasises the negative impact stress can have on productivity, with 79% of organisations reporting some stress-related absence over the last year. So, the idea that organisations could purposely generate or allow pressure and stress to raise employee performance sounds counterintuitive, right? Well, not necessarily.\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests – Alexandra Lichtenfeld, Business Mentor at Client Matters, Dr Serra Pitts, Clinical Director at 87% Limited, and Alan Lambert, International Strategic HR Change Leader at TotalEnergies – as we explore the benefits of positive stress and why generating healthy levels of pressure can drive higher individual, team and organisation performance.",

I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow, like it or not, stress has become a defining feature of our working lives.  The CIPD's latest health and wellbeing at work report found 8 out of 10 organisations reporting stress related absences and most of us, we've had a basinful, haven't we, in the last couple of years; family health and financial worries have affected work behaviour, performance and relationships.  It's no wonder that we see stress as something to be avoided, at all costs. But even so, maybe pressure at work is getting a bad rap since we know that stress responses are crucial to our survival, could we maybe reduce the negative stress and harness some positive pressure to achieve more? Well, let's find out.  With me, an employee wellbeing and culture specialist who has run her own mentoring business for 11 years, she's also a Samaritan and a police chaplain, Alexandra Lichtenfeld.  Hello?\nAlexandra Lichtenfeld: Hello, hello.  Hello.\nNC: With her, a chartered psychologist who has long delivered mental health and wellbeing programmes to global clients, she is Clinical Director of the wellbeing data and insights firm 87%, she's Dr Sarah Pitts.  Hello?\nDr Sarah Pitts: Hi, Nigel, thank you so much for having me.\nNC: And to complete the set, an international and strategic HR change leader at Total Energies who has had a lot to say about the merits of careful harnessing of pressure for good, it's Alan Lambert.  Hello.\nAlan Lambert: Hi.  Pleased to be with you.\nNC: Alan, before we get to the science and this whole rather counterintuitive idea of deliberately turning up the pressure on people for results, I mean it's business life itself that winds people up every day at the moment, isn't it?  I mean, it's managers and colleagues that stress us out through their style and expectations.  Don't we have to fix all that first?\nAL: So that's a good point, Nigel, I think in any organisation, the people we work with can be indeed a trigger for some of the stress reactions that we have, managers amongst the key people that can play a good role in people's wellbeing in the workplace.  So yeah, you're absolutely right that we need to make sure these fundamental basics are in place to begin with and that the managers are taking good care and supporting their teams.\nNC: So, how do we do that?  How do you just establish where people are just getting needlessly stressed out by systems, by meetings that don't need to take place, by management checking up on them all the time, not leaving them to get on with the job?\nAL: Now, one of the things that we think about is the role of the manager in acting as a manager coach and supporting and facilitating the teams, perhaps taking a step back from the traditional way of management and putting themselves more in a role of a facilitator, getting out of the way and letting the team get on with the task in hand, and helping them to do so.  Simplifying things if things need to be simplified and helping people innovate and find the most efficient way of doing things.\nNC: Well, let's go to Sarah Pitts.  I mean I guess stress, I mean it's a biological response to events, isn't it?  Hopefully, a temporary, but can you tell us a bit more about what happens when we're faced with these conflicts, with overwork and all the rest?  I mean, there are physical effects and there's stuff going on in our brains.\nSP: Absolutely right.  And, you know, we all know stress has many sources.  It comes from our environment, in terms of our work environment and the people around us, but also it comes from our bodies, as you've said, and our thoughts and how we view the world around us.  So, when we feel under pressure, what's happening in our nervous system is instructing our bodies to release stress hormones, including those you may have heard of, adrenaline and cortisol, and something else called noradrenaline.  And these are what produce those physiological changes and it helps us cope with the threat or danger that we see upon us.  That's called our stress response.  When you feel it, you know it's happening to you because you get tense, your heart beats faster, you're ultimately preparing your body to fight, flee or, in some cases, freeze.  And because those stressors that we're facing at work aren't as life threatening as they might have been thousands of years ago, where you're running from something, some of those chemicals aren't needed in our body anymore, so they get stored up and we sort of overreact and over respond and that's what makes us feel unwell, when that persists.\nNC: So, if that's so, Alexandra, then do you kind of agree that if we can sort out the everyday issues with all that, that gives us a bit more headroom to earn the right to turn up the heat on particular projects?\nALi: To go back to the reason why we're having this conversation, you know, what is stress?  Is there good stress?  What is bad stress?  So usually, stress is discussed as a negative and I think Alan, you know, would agree with that for sure.  And most of us equate stress with something bad.  So, to go back to your question is there such a thing as good stress, there is, because stress can also be positive and eustress, which is good stress, it's Greek by the way...\nNC: Alright, let's just pick up on this idea of eustress.  Now this is spelt like E, U, stress.\nALi: E, U, stress, yes.\nNC: I haven't come across this before, I thought it had to do with Brexit.  So...\nALi: E, U means good.\nNC: OK, Sarah, this is a thing, this is a proven thing?\nSP: Absolutely right.  Eustress is the positive form of stress.  We all need stress.  We need stress to live, we need stress to breathe, we need stress to get out the door.  But there's, like Alex said, there's the positive type that that keeps us going, keeps us on our toes, it motivates us, it gives us energy; and then there's the negative stress, which I talked about the hormones and things that are happening in your body that builds up those toxins and makes us feel unable to perform or to go on in some cases.\nNC: OK, so Alan, how do we start to tap the good stress, if you like, the pressure that gets results, that gets teams together, that gets a bit of adrenaline going when there's something going on, what part do managers have to play in that?\nAL: Yeah, managers for me, play an absolutely pivotal role in getting positive stress, eustress right.  Managers are the ones who are setting objectives, managers are the ones who are assigning the tasks to people in an organisation and they're the ones who are going to be deciding which human resources, which individuals they put against which activities.\nNC: So I mean, it seems to me you need to know your people and their capabilities pretty well, don't you, before you even try to raise the bar?\nALi: No one person has the same level of stress and what leads to stress or what leads to good stress or distress, so you have to know your people.\nNC: I was going to ask Sarah about that.  We hear talk, don't we, about snowflakes, about certain workers who you kind of almost get the sense are kind of frightened of hard work, who set the bar for themselves rather low.  I mean, do we actually have to sort of look at how every individual responds to stress or what they think is stress?  Maybe it isn't stress at all?\nSP: I think that yes, it's really important to get to know your people better, like Alex says and like Alan is referring to, because then you can understand, for them, what causes pressure is not just stress, it's what's important to them.  What are their passions?  What are their strengths?  And when you think about the generational differences, you're thinking about that younger age group, the Gen Z and the younger millennials, who have watched all of us, you know, make ourselves ill and are thinking that's not for me, or I want to do it differently, or I'd like to have a different sort of lifestyle.  And so, it's not the same for every generation, it's not a generational bias.  You've got to get to know your people because your strengths, their strengths and their passions are what's going to impact their pressure and how they perform.  And I'm sure Alan can say a lot about what he has seen, in terms of differences between people and why it really pays to get to know your people.\nAL: Yeah, thanks.  I fully agree with that.  I think the key things that any manager needs to keep in mind when they're assigning tasks to their team, first of all is the skills, so what level of competence do people have and, as you've just said, Sarah, the other aspect is what intrinsic drivers they have, what motivates them.  If you know individually, the intrinsic drivers and the skills, you can get the stimulation level right and place people in a position where they've got focus and rational thinking to their job, and that gets them to behave in the most efficient way.  If you're putting them outside of that area of comfort and you are putting them in a zone where they have no skills or no motivation, then clearly it's not going to work as well.\nALi: It's very difficult for any leadership team and any management team.  You've got to know yourself, so you have to know your own limits, and what stretches me might not stretch Sarah or Nigel or yourself, Alan.  And the same with managers, all people manage differently and most managers, I hope that Alan will agree with this, are not trained well enough to manage their people, on the whole, in UK businesses.  Or in any businesses.\nNC: So tell me, when you're working with a company, Alexandra, just tell me about the contrast.  Say, when you go in and people say they're suffering from a lot of stress, they possibly are, so how do you counsel them?  And then just say a little bit more about you try and harness this eustress, this good stress, the pressure at work which actually gets results and people find satisfying.\nALi: It's interesting you ask that because, to me, it's... and what I've found in all the companies I go, and where I mentor their staff, from leadership team right down to receptionists, it's about relationships and it stems from the relationships.  And a lot of the people I have mentored over the years, most of their stressors have been from not understanding the relationships they're in.  A lot of my mentoring starts on one to one but often, Nigel, I bring a third person in who is maybe causing my mentee the stress that they're feeling and then you open up, and it's not a can of worms, it's a wonderful place to be, because you open up a conversation between two people who haven't understood each other.  That is a small amount of the stress that happens.  But then they start to understand each other and what workload they can or cannot handle.  So, to answer that question, it's down to relationships.  That's what I find when you mentor people.  A lot of people can go up to someone and ask to do something, or be asked to do something, and they know that they're swamped with everything and they also don't know how to say, \"No, I cannot do this now but I can do it next week\".  It's being able to articulate how you're feeling in a very positive way.\nSP: Or even to be able to say, \"I'm not the best person for that job\".\nALi: Absolutely.\nSP: And that confidence to say that to someone definitely comes from within but managers need to learn that too.  They need to build that trust with their people so that people feel comfortable and confident enough to say things like that, things that they perceive might be not taken well.  Actually, Alan, you could say well give them, as a manager, an opportunity to place that person where they're best fit and bring someone else into that particular area, if needed.\nAL: Absolutely.  I certainly don't disagree with what you're saying on the need for management training; I've been working in leadership and management training coming up for a decade, and HR for longer than that.  But the thing I would like to perhaps drawback is it's not all on the manager shoulders, it's also about having a growth mindset and an approach to learning on the individual themselves.  And that's crucial because, if you don't see the challenge in a positive light, you're going to feel negative pressure.  Whereas if you see the challenge as something that... as an opportunity to learn and grow and develop, you're more likely to see it in a positive light, therefore harness it as eustress and use it as a as a learning opportunity.\nNC: It's interesting you've mentioned that, Alan, because I just saw some of the stuff you've been writing, and you put this thing about reframing stressful work as a positive challenge.  If you really can do that, I can see that's brilliant.  But if it actually doesn't work, I can imagine people being very cynical, you know, they go to their manager, they feel stressed, and they're just told to reframe, but the workload hasn't changed\nALi: In listening to everybody, it's interesting, I think the word stress, when we're talking about good stress has to go.  It's not stress.\nNC: Yes.  So, if this is not about putting more stress on workers to get results, what is it then?\nALi: I think it's about helping a worker to learn how to be on top of all the pressures they have at work, but also life and work crosses over.\nNC: I was going to say, that would help them outside the workplace, wouldn't it?\nALi: It would.  So, you remove the word stress from the good side of it and you talk about how can we help you stimulate your work ethic or stimulate you enough to start to grow, as Alan was talking about, growing as a person and have a feeling and a sense of achievement.  Instead of using good stress, say let's find a way of stimulating you, let's find a way of how you can grow as a person, outside and inside the workplace.  And, you know, even asking your employee or your manager, what can we do to help you achieve what you want to achieve.  And again, people's goals are in varying different levels.\nNC: I did read that happy people in the workplace aren't the most productive.\nALi: I would disagree with that wholeheartedly.  I think contented, happy people are much more productive.  There's no presenteeism there, that's when you're feeling really bad about yourself and you're still going to work, and you can't... you can't actually get anything done.  But from my experience, from mentoring, is that after three months of mentoring a person is at least 60% more productive.  That's what I've found in the business I've...\nNC: 60%?\nALi: Yeah.  They're happy, they're contented, and they're happy in themselves, they learn about themselves, therefore, as you said before, take it outside of the workplace.  What they're learning about themselves helps them in their life, as well as their work life.  A happy person is a much more productive person, that is my view.\nNC: So, let me ask both Sarah and Alan, how do people managers help engender this in the workplace?  Because of course, they're not necessarily supervising people's work all the time.  This is about a much broader way that an entire operation works.\nAL: Yeah, you're absolutely right, managers are not on the back of their team the whole time.  However, my view is that the manager needs to have this helicopter view of the activity.  And if we look at, particularly in my industry where we're in an energy industry, it's a heavily industrial asset focused business and, with our industrial assets, then we'd be taking care of monitoring them and making sure that they're operating the way they should do, and they're not being pushed over and over they're built capacity.  And for me, the managers' role is the same but for the human assets, or the human capital of the organisation.  They shouldn't be on the back of the team all the time, but they should be monitoring to make sure that things are not getting out of control, and that they're able to adjust if necessary, if they do.\nSP: I would agree with that and say that, in terms of monitoring, you know, there's all these technologies now that we use, that HR uses, but also our company in particular, that's what we do, is we embed monitoring and tools to assess how are your people feeling, how are they getting on, do they feel they're being heard, are they listened to, do they fit, do they belong.  And it's these kinds of things that make people feel confident and comfortable in their role, and able to have those relationships that Alex talked about, but also have that word that you said, Nigel, happiness.  Happiness is such a hard thing to measure, because it means so many different things to different people.  And I think sometimes that research is a little bit misleading because, you know, a lot of people don't know what makes them happy.  A lot of people think that what they should be doing leads to happiness, as opposed to what really matters or what sort of personal values we have.\nALi: And also you're not happy 24 hours a day, seven days a week; you have moments of happiness.  But within those moments of happiness, you want to have moments of feeling worth.\nNC: I can see why that might be true.  I was seeing some figures here on what jobs that people said were the most stressful, to use that word, and midwifery, social care, and bar and restaurant work came up at the top of the list.  These are jobs which can be very pressured.  But I would imagine, for some people who've chosen them, they're also immensely satisfied.\nSP: Can I respond to that?  Actually, what you're saying is really valuable.  Because it's in those health and social care environments, what we're seeing a lot of in the data is compassion fatigue.  So, it's people who go into that work where they're looking after others, and they do it because they love it and it's important to them, and it really matters.  Those people score really high on happiness.  But what they don't score high on is anxiety and depression and stress; they have all of those symptoms of compassion fatigue because that relationship work is so draining.  And, in terms of the hospitality industry, what I know from working in hospitality is that, again it's about the customers, it's about the relationships.  You have this demand, right, but you're people facing all of the time.  And some of those people aren't treating you very well, if you're working in hospitality.  You're sort of just there to service them.  And that can be... I have seen for people in some big global, fast food chains, that is debilitating, that makes you not want to come into work to deal with those interactions that are dismissive or challenging.\nNC: So Alan, does this mean we can't take down the pressure in some everyday jobs for people; that we've got to be very careful about raising it when we think that might be necessary?\nAL: I'm kind of stuck on answering that question, because I've got the image of hospitality in my brain, Nigel, because when I trained, I was financing my legal studies through doing lots of bar work and waitering work, and it just made me reflect back to my youth and thinking actually, some of those jobs were the highest pressured jobs that I've ever done, including all the HR and legal jobs that I've had since.  And I personally, if you were to ask me which type of a rota would I be in, would I be in a quiet country pub, where you'd have maybe two customers come to the bar every hour?  Or would you rather be in Cardiff Student Union, which is where I worked as well at some point, when you're serving a hundred customers in any sort of ten minute period, I would much rather be in the busy one.  And that's maybe something about me, that's maybe very personal.\nALi: But that's also an example of eustress, Alan, because...\nAL: Is it?\nALi: ...that's you challenging yourself, becoming invigorated by what you're doing, and starting to see small wins in yourself, like I managed that, I've got home, I served everyone.  I'm going to do it again tomorrow.  And you might say to yourself, I'm going to do even better tomorrow or I'm going to talk to people differently tomorrow.  But I wonder whether... and I'm only thinking about this now, whether the vernacular needs to be changed, because is it pressure or is it understanding what people need in a business?  Because if you understand what people need in the business, and you've got to understand what the business needs as well, because, you know, ROI can't be forgotten and your bottom line can't be forgotten, but if you understand that you don't... if your people believe you don't want to put pressure on them but you want them to be the best they can be, that is a very different vernacular.\nSP: I agree.  I agree with you.  But I think that pressure is needed.  And I think you're saying the same thing.  And Alan, your point about bad environment, I also prefer a high pressure, high demand environment.  So you kind of can't remove the pressure and...\nNC: I mean, it can be abused, can't it, by managers?\nSP: It can.\nALi: Of course.\nNC: And I saw that play, I don't know if any of you saw it, quite recently, about people working in a call centre and whenever they kept putting more and more pressure on people to work more and more quickly, and produce evermore, you know, per hour, they kept making them parrot, you know, you've got to be totally customer focused, or whatever the phrase was.  And this... I mean that was grossly unfair.\nAli: But some people like targets and some people don't like targets, and some people who don't like targets do better than those who like targets, it's all...\nNC: So, it comes round to that thing about understanding your people better.\nALi: Exactly, you took the words out of my mouth, Nigel.\nNC: And actually getting them to put the pressure on themselves, Alan, perhaps?\nAL: It's also about capability and skill.  In your example, Nigel, of call centre, even if you are 100% competent in answering the calls but you're expected to do so in a way that is just totally unachievable, that you're not going to have the capacity to answer the volume of calls being expected to answer, despite having the level of skill and competency, it's going to drive your ability to do it right back down to low which, if you've then got the challenge on the other side, it's going to put you into a moment of anxiety.  So, you need to make sure that the... not only the competency of the individual, but also the expectation that's being put by the organisation is not putting someone in inability to fulfil the task.\nALi: But on top of that, I think businesses... I will go back to using the word pressure, put pressure on the people but don't actually give the resources to their people, to equip them to deal with what they're being asked to do as well.  So, it's a whole circle of things that have to be addressed.\nSP: And that's part of what causes stress.  Stress is, in fact, scientifically a reaction to not having the resources to deal with the demand.  And I think demand is the thing to be considered really, from an HR and a business point of view.  Because putting people under pressure, we'll use that hospitality scenario again, that pressure is inherent, you've signed up for that and that's fine, because you can handle it.  It's the demand.  If you're doing that for 6, 8, 10, 12 hours, 5, 6, 7 days a week, that's when it becomes unmanageable.  Because the body is built in a certain way to handle physiological change, and pressure and stress, we're designed that way.  That's what makes us so resilient.  But if we don't have those periods of rest after performing at our peak, then we will succumb to that lack of energy, and we will decline in our performance.  And that's the science, that's all of us.  And we all have those peaks, and we all have those troughs, and it's part of... part of knowing yourself is what is my rhythm, what is my capability, what can I handle, where do I need to skill up, where do I need support, at what point do I need rest.  So, we have to know those things as individuals.  We also have to be confident enough to tell our managers and our leaders those things about ourselves, and then ideally have an open, welcome, honest conversation with our manager.\nNC: OK, so as we try and draw this to a close, let me go back to Alan and ask you just a sort of final thought from you, if you can, about how you dial down the needless stress and that you just move to a situation where you have positive pressure in an organisation.\nAL: From a manager's perspective, it's about knowing the individuals, setting them objectives that are achievable and that are in line with their capability to deliver.  So, it's about getting them to push the boundaries of what is manageable but, as Sarah was saying a moment ago, not doing so on a full time basis.  So, it's about pushing them at times and then also allowing them times to recover.\nSP: I would say that's right from an individual and a managerial point of view.  I would add that, from a business point of view, a fundamental culture change or a shift in attitude requires buy in from the top.  And I have seen this first hand, the companies that do this really well, they don't just endorse it, they live it, they believe it.  And they role model that ethos, and it takes time to embed and to change things.  But otherwise, your people won't... they won't perceive it as being authentic and then there's a dissonance between what's being said and what's being done, and then people feel confused and they don't fit.  And that just causes more stress.\nALi: If they don't trust you, they're not going to trust any of the solutions you might put in place to help them along the way.  So, you know, it doesn't always come from top down, some of the things we talk about in business, but this does.  Because even the most senior managers and leadership teams, they all suffer.  Everybody suffers, we know this.  And I've worked with a management consultancy firm before and I didn't work for them for very long, because they're very high flying business management consultants that they don't want to talk about any of the crap, if I can say that word, that they're having to deal with and I could not work...\nNC: The messy reality.\nALi: Messy reality.  They just... they didn't want to and, you know, and Sarah would agree, there are some businesses that, you know, just don't want help and don't want...\nSP: They don't, no.\nALi: They just don't.  They don't want to hear it.  I think they probably know, deep down.\nNC: So finally, I mean all the stuff you do with people, Alexandra, are you convinced that it is possible to dial down on the needless stress and actually make work more of a pleasure, using a little bit of pressure now and again?\nALi: I think you can dial down the stress and make productivity higher, not necessarily by dialling down the pressure.  It's about getting your people to understand why they are having to do what you want them to do.  Something my dad taught me many years ago, when he was an officer in the army, and he said, a lot of officers would go to their people and say do this, this, this and this, and he would say to them, I need you to do this because it will have a direct effect to this, this and this.  And he taught me that many, many years ago; maybe why I'm in this field that I'm in.  You have to explain to people why you want them to do stuff.\nSP: I would agree.  I would totally agree with Alex and say that you can use pressure purposely in organisations, it's not counterintuitive.  You just have to make the employee part of that conversation.  Because if you have these really high expectations of your people and you don't let them know that, then there's not a mutual conversation.\nALi: And at the same time, you have to enable your people to believe that if they come to you for help, or advice that you will listen.\nNC: Brilliant, Alexandra Lichtenfeld, Sarah Pitts and Alan Lambert, thank you all very much for a brilliant discussion, really on the money in this still very uncertain hybrid working world.

So how can L&D professionals ensure ‘learning transfer’ is accurately measured and that training has the desired impact?",
      "summary": "Organisations often invest large sums of money in learning and development opportunities for their people, but CIPD research finds that only a small minority are evaluating the wider impact on business or society (8%). Learning transfer – applying newly acquired knowledge and skills to real-life situations in the workplace – should be an integral part of the L&D process. So how can organisations measure whether their L&D programmes are having the desired impact?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests – Robert Brinkerhoff, Senior Research Adviser at Promote International, and David Hayden, Digital Learning Portfolio Manager at the CIPD – as we explore the benefits of measuring and evaluating learning transfer in your organisation.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:27:39\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy:  Gaining from training, how an understanding of learning transfer helps skills actually sink in and benefit the business. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow, here's an all too familiar scenario, you or your people spend hours on end online or in a classroom doing essential training, yet when it's done, you're so weighed down by your day to day duties, hardly anybody has the time, the motivation, or gets the necessary encouragement to actually apply their newly acquired skills, so they're soon forgotten. This may be why I'm still rubbish at spreadsheets. So, this podcast is all about learning transfer, I mean, could it just be the missing link in ensuring that money spent on training isn't wasted, but benefits the business? With us, a man who's something of a guru in the field of evaluating the impact of learning and development, his methods are well known to many professionals in the field, he's Senior Research Advisor for Promote International, it's Robert Brinkerhoff, hello.\nRobert Brinkerhoff:  Hello there.\nNC:  And from the home team, the CIPD's own Portfolio Manager for digital learning, he's pretty hot on linking learning and development with organisational performance, so a welcome return to the podcast for David Hayden, hello.\nDavid Hayden:  Hello Nigel, hello Robert, it's really good to be in this forum with you today.\nRB:  Thank you.\nNC:  OK, well David, I'll start with you. I mean, learning transfer seems a pretty obvious goal for any training whatsoever, I mean, there wouldn't be any point in the training otherwise, would there? So, I'm slightly perplexed as to why it's so poor in the first place.\nDH:  I think there's a number of reasons which, which we'll unpick as we, as we go through this podcast. For me there's the busyness of learning and development teams, so learning and development teams are very often on a treadmill of design, deliver, design, deliver, and, and there's a lot of history around effectiveness of learning and development teams being, having to be in the classroom in front of people for something like 60%, 70%, 80% of time, so it's, it's, it's not seen as a, as a core priority of a trainer or a learning and development manager's role I think in the past. And we've got some kind of really interesting stats that are emerging from a, a number of our research in terms of what we're starting to see is a thirst for people wanting to do more of this, but really kind of struggling with how to actually apply this.\nNC:  But I mean, do people care? I mean, this didn't even crop up much in the CIPD's most recent skills surveys.\nDH:  That's a really good question, do people care? I think yes, I think people do care, it's around how we help them to, to be able to free up some time and the utilise some tools to, to actually undertake measurements around transfer of learning.\nNC:  Now, Robert Brinkerhoff, everywhere online you can find well, quite similar charts, often they're a cone showing the percentage of knowledge that people typically retain from learning, what they see, what they hear and so on, and the success rate is often quoted as low as just 10%. I mean, can that be right, I mean really, do they forget 90% of what they've learnt?\nRB:  Well, I don't think it's a matter so much of forgetting what they've learned. I think when we look at the historically low rates of transfer in training in learning and development organisations, it's useful to think of, of process management and what we've learned about quality control, and that is that when you're getting a consistent result over and over again, it means that you've got processes in place that are reliably producing those results. So, we've got to think about what, what are we doing and not doing that is keeping those transfer rates low?\nAnd it's quite interesting, if you look historically, training transfer was never an issue 100 years ago when people were training via the apprenticeship models, where everything was taking place on the job, you know, and the learning and development profession has grown dramatically in the last 30, 40 years, and it took us a lot of time to get professional and get our name on the door, the learning centre. But getting our name on the door came with a cost, and that cost is now that people think, oh, well that's, that's where they do the training and learning, and we do the work and the business over here. So, we've separated the function, and once we separated it, transfer became an issue. So, we've got to think about why is it such a problem? And like David says, you know, most training departments have been designed from the start to just deliver content at the lowest per unit cost, which means get as many people in the classroom as you can and get one single trainer working with them, and when it's over, you're done. And I think the expectation for a lot of participants is not at all that, you mean you want me to actually use this stuff? I thought I was just supposed to show up today and learn it.\nNC:  So, if people see the training as a nice day out of the office or a quiet afternoon ticking some multiple choice boxes, you've kind of not got them on board from the start have you --\nRB:  Sure.\nNC:  So, that, that sounds --\nRB:  Sure.\nNC:  Pretty, pretty depressing really. But David, let's look at a typical situation, some training or whatever has been designed, it's been delivered, the evaluation forms have been collected and they're pretty positive about the trainers, participants say they've learnt a lot. So, tell us what happens next which raises alarm bells, that learning hasn't transferred, and why is that ignored?\nDH:  Well, I, I think there's, there's a few steps in terms of collecting that data at the end of the traditional session in, in the first place what, what helps with those alarm bells. Because was the trainer any good, did you like the trainer? You know, no other department does that in, in the organisation, you don't go to finance and say, oh, can you sort my expenses out? And, and finance goes, oh, before you disappear, rate me on the job that I'm paid to do by this organisation and performance managed by my manager. So, we're kind of really weirdly unique in, in that sense in, in most of the organisation. So, the time, effort, and energy of collecting that data is just wasted opportunity, there's much better questions to, to ask on that form if you're still going to use a form, there's much better questions to ask that we can use to exert our energy in terms of collecting data.\nI think there's also the thing around, as, as Robert said, that kind of whole process around target driven for the trainer is, is kind of misguided, so you know, let's, let's free up some of that time for, so people can go and find out for instance what happened next. So, I was working closely with one learning and development manager who worked in a, a processing plant where you needed steel toe capped footwear to, to go into the processing plant. I was working with this learning and development manager, and I said to her, come on, let's, let's, let's go and have a look around, see what's happening on the shop floor. And she said, oh, I can't go on because I haven't got my steel capped footwear. I said, well, where are they? She said, oh, they're at home because I only bring them when I really, really have to. That was kind of like typical of, does learning and development really understand what's going on, on the job, in the real working environment? And I think what we need to do is start understanding that a lot more, and being able to articulate that a, a lot more, as a first step really in terms of moving forward, rather than just spending lots of time, energy, and effort on this whole churning of useless data that doesn't tell us anything really, other than there's a sycophant love of the trainer.\nNC:  OK. If we could move this Robert, a bit more onto what happens a bit further down the track. We've already heard there's fault lines in what people are asked about the training and so on, but then when things don't pan out, when people have potential new skills that they don't deploy, when they feel they don't have time or encouragement to try new things, tell us a bit more about why training pans out badly?\nRB:  Well, it, you know, it's interesting, like you when you started out, you said that well, training gets historically low rates of transfer. So, let's say just for example, we put 100 people through training and the expected transfer rate is 20 of those 100 will actually end up using it. Let's think for a minute about, what about the other 80, why didn't they? I mean, one explanation is that only 20% of them could have benefitted from the training, and the other 80% are too ignorant or incompetent to have gotten anything from it, that's one explanation. The second explanation is that more people could have used it, but something got in the way. If you believe the first explanation, you'd no longer be in this learning and development profession, the second one is clearly the truth. So, what we know is there's a lot of stuff that gets in the way, and one of the fundamental underlying issues comes down to what I would call expectation and accountability, are people expected to use it, and are they accountable for using it, and are their managers accountable for making sure that they do use it? Now, that condition is rarely met, but when it is met, then we find that training transfer is more like 80%, 90%, close to 100%, so expectation and accountability really says it all. I did an evaluation study of a large organisation a couple of years ago where 300 managers or senior leaders were, were put through the training, it cost about $4 million almost per cohort to do it because they were sent to India, they went to the London School of Economics for a week, very expensive training programme, and we found that hardly anybody was using it. So, when we interviewed folks afterwards who didn't use it, I asked them this one question, and in fact I'd like David and Nigel, for you to answer the question, so the question I said was, OK, now that you've finished this year long effort and you're back at work, what would happen to you, what would be the consequence if you never used any of what you learned in the last year in your job, what would the consequence, or what would happen to you, be? And what the answer I heard back?\nNC:  Nothing?\nDH:  Nothing, yeah, yeah.\nRB:  Nothing, exactly, nothing. Now look, let's pose that question to 500 people in a presentation, all learning and development people, and they all say, nothing. And so, when we talked to those folks about, about that lack of expectation and accountability, their view of the training was that it was provided to them as sort of a reward for having worked hard, in other words it was a staff benefit. I earned the right to be here, I've worked hard, I deserve to have this training, it goes in my resume, it's a wonderful entry for my CV, and maybe I'll use it here to get promoted or in my next job somewhere else. So, their expectation was completely it was a staff benefit, yet when I talked to the people who sponsored the training, who were spending the millions of dollars to do it, they said, absolutely we need to change our managerial behaviours, we're boxed in silos, we're not collaborating across the organisation, and we need to change that. That expectation was never communicated to the people in the training, and it was never, no one was held accountable for ever having used it.\nDH:  To add to that, I would encourage everyone to have a look at their, their reward policies within their organisation and see is training and learning and development an integral part of that reward policy? Because that sets a tone, that, sets a, a series of kind of missed expectations around it. Oh, you know, I've, I've got, I've got a, a right to the reward of, of, of this learning, for all the reasons kind of Robert, Robert said there. So, yeah, have, have a look at, you know, listeners, have a, have a look at your reward policy and, and are you happy learning is in that reward policy?\nNC:  Let's try and break down some of the steps involved in doing what Robert was saying, to actually try and ensure that good learning transfer is sort of built in from the get-go of any learning and development activity, and then sort of measured for effectiveness as well. Presumably Robert, you have to start with the desired outcomes, I mean, defining exactly what you hope people will be able to achieve? It sounds obvious, but I guess --\nRB:  Yeah, no, absolutely --\nNC:  Maybe it isn't being in practice?\nRB:  Absolutely, you're right. And, and even there's a step before that, if you look at, if you look at in a modern organisation the learning and development portfolio, the programmes that, that are existing in that, not all of them even have to transfer. So, let me just give you an example, here's a company that spends $10 million a year training employees in a skill, and at the end of the year we found out that nobody is using the training. Now, was that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, it depends, the company I'm talking about happens to be an airline company and the training happens to be titled, how to land a fully loaded 747 aircraft if the landing gear are jammed, how to land it safely and not kill everybody on board. Now, if that training was transferring and getting used on a regular basis, that company's got problems way beyond learning and development. So, my point is, there are different value propositions for training. Some value propositions go through a transfer route, and that's the sort of training where we're training people to execute new strategy or new change that's vital to the mission, but emergency training, we don't want people using that all the time. There's career development training, it's where people are, we're training people so they're ready for a promotion, that doesn't have to transfer immediately. Mandatory or regulatory training, where the purpose is to just tick the box that everybody's participated, otherwise we're likely to get sued.\nSo, the first step is, prioritise the training programmes and identify those that, that have a value proposition that requires transfer and behaviour change, and then for those, then Nigel, that's where we want to begin to think about how can we design and deliver this in a way that's likely to get 80%, 90% transfer rates? And that means typically, changing our paradigm to be not one of learning and delivery of content, but rather the paradigm of performance improvement, looking at, if these people are to change their behaviour, what's likely to get in their way, and how do we get rid of those obstacles, as well as how do we get them the skills they need to execute these new behaviours?\nNC:  Sure. And that example of the safety training was clearly pretty outrageous, but David, a lot of it tends to be more subtle, this is about things organisations don't achieve because people haven't used initiative, they haven't drawn on those skills, and maybe that is hard to measure?\nDH:  Yeah, and I, I, I agree with what Robert said there, and, and that is, you know, I think every organisation can do its own kind of variation of the how to land a, a jet plane safely, and so that, you, you could argue first aid training is, is pretty similar. I'd take issue with, with the mandatory training a, a, a little bit because for me, that's not, it, it, it shouldn't be about ticking boxes, it should be about what is it we need to do to keep our people safe, and what are the current issues? So, rather than churning everyone through the same type of thing, you know, oh just do a quick 20 minutes, it's only 20 minutes of your life to do this piece of training, make it as real as possible to the risks that are exposed to the organisation, and, and, and what do people currently know and what do they want to know? So, I think there's a lot more opportunity to explore with compliance training, in terms of being able to transfer that, rather than just me being able to repeat verbatim because I've done it every year for the past 20 years, you cannot take data out of the UK and the EU, what does that mean? I can say it all verbatim, that line has transferred, but the practical application of that has not.\nRB:  And look at the sorts of training that's done for diversity, and equity, and inclusion, or sexual harassment, you know, so often, again, it's expectation and accountability, but if the expectation is that, oh look at, look at David, you haven't been to that, you haven't filled your, completed your course yet, make sure you get that done because they're auditing at the end of the month, got to make sure you took the course. But if the, if the expectation is, look it, you need to identify the behaviours that you're doing now that are getting in the way of inclusion and diversity in our workplace, and we've got to change those, that's a very different paradigm. So, let's be clear about what we need and expect, and then, then we can design it to make a difference.\nAnd I don't buy for a minute that we're not measuring transfer because it's too hard to measure, human beings are natural transfer measurers, look at when you're raising your children, if your ten year old child is not picking up their room and you do some training on how to clean your room, how difficult is it to see if it's working or not? It's a piece of cake. And it's the same rule applies in take a look around and see what's happening, and it's easy to do. It's a question of will, not it's too hard to measure.\nNC:  Well, you say it's easy to do, David Hayden, have you any thoughts about how you improve the real life workplace support from managers after the training, so they're less focused on what we've heard about --\nDH:  Yeah.\nNC:  The sort of ticking --\nDH:  Yeah.\nNC:  The boxes, and that actually managers are getting more involved in what they hope people can start achieving, what skills and techniques have been learnt and can benefit the business?\nDH:  Yeah, so I, I, for me there, there are two clear strands, two clear practical strands with this. First of all, it's look at what we've got in our leadership and our management development programmes, and are we actually putting things in there that actually help us to achieve this goal, or are we filling them with things that are out of date and, and, and people cannot apply? So, if we develop our managers to help us with this, then we're on, on a, a, a good starting block. The second is, is something that is a variation of, of something I know Robert has been around for nearly 20 years, you devised a success case study method, my variation of, of that is, is just pure and simple, finding out what happened next. So, every so often, getting a group of people together, both either formally or informally, and just saying, oh, this happened, what happened next? And just listening and, and just getting all that rich data from, from those conversations, it really can be that simple.\nRB:  You know, the perennial issue has been, how do we get managers to support training, you know? And we, we, we should not be approaching managers as supplicants, so if, if David is a manager and I'm the learning and development person, I shouldn't be going to him saying, David look, we've got some training coming up, I really could use your help because it kind of looks bad if we don't get people using it, so can you give me a, give me a break here and support it, I'll do you a favour next time? Rather I should approach him and say, David, we've got some training coming up, I know you're accountable for driving market share in your unit, we've got some training coming up that's supposed to help with that, so I want to talk to you about how can we make sure this isn't a waste of time and money, how can we make sure it, it helps you get done what you need to get done? So, we've got to show managers what's in it for them to support the training. Managers will do what makes a difference to the things they're accountable for, so if we can show them how it's going to help their, their unit performance, and then give them evidence as whether it's working or not, we can get their buy in and support. But we, we don't want to appeal to them and say, look it, be a good guy, one of your, you got to support training, we've got to show them, how is it going to make a difference to your organisation and the things you're accountable for, when we do that, they're ready to support us.\nNC:  And there is a pattern here, isn't there, that learning is commissioned, it's devised, it's delivered, the business doesn't see benefits, so managers blame the training or the trainers?\nDH:  Yeah, absolutely. And, and it is a, a vicious circle, and, and until something can stop to break that very efficient malfunctioning process, until something can break that, then, then you're going to be in that for, for quite a while.\nRB:  The manager says, I really don't expect much from this training, and then they don't support it, and low and behold they were right, they didn't support it and they didn't get much from it, their people didn't get much from it, and now they say, see, I was right not to support it. So, they're --\nNC:  Yeah.\nRB:  We've got to spin that cycle the other way and show them. So, when we evaluate training, we find, we find those pockets where the training did work and did make a difference, and tell that story, and find out when it worked, why did it work, and what good did it do for those managers who are the owners of the results. If we can show them and say, look, look, this unit over here happened to increase their market share, or they increased their sales, or reduced their scrap rate, and you know how they did that? Their manager supported the training and gave feedback to the people, if you want to see results like that, we can help you get them. Any time training works, it's because it was a partnership between the L&D department, the learning department, and the customers of that training, they got together and agreed to make it work.\nDH:  And to, to add to that, I think as well, it's about, about making sure there's time, whenever we're together with people, making sure there's time to, to say, look, where are the barriers, where are the blockages? And being able to feed that back. As well as Robert kind of written quite a few things around learning transfer, so has someone called Doctor Ina Weinbauer-Heidel, she talks about net transfer rates, so she actually asks people, what's the likelihood of you being able to transfer this back into your workplace? So, right in, in the middle of when you're in a virtual classroom or a face to face environment, asking that question explicitly. And the confidence of the, the facilitator to be able to ask that, has, has got to be really high, but we, we, we've got to ask those sorts of questions, you know, you've just spent this amount of time with us, we've been talking around this, what is the likelihood of you going away and applying it? If we get everyone saying yes and nothing happens, there's some data there for us to act on, if everyone says, no, I'm not going to be able to do it because, there's some data for us to act on, and we've got to be really prepared to say, right, if we're serious about performance, we've got to do something with this data.\nNC:  Well, clearly, you're comfortable with looking back at some of those theories and the questions people need to be asked as a result. I just wondered, Robert, I mean, you, you read about Kirkpatrick's four levels, Phillips return on investment, there's all kinds of things people can study, in your experience, do many practitioners either really understand those, or find them useful?\nRB:  Many claim to find them useful but then don't use them, you know. And what I think we, we really need to change the expectation on the part of our clients and our customers, instead of promised them that we're going to deliver the training, let's start making promises that we're going to deliver results from the training. Now, that's going out on a limb to do that, but if our customers, if we help them expect results from us, we can begin to get them. And so, it's a matter of willing to be held accountable for that, creating that partnership with our internal customers, that's going to make a difference. But you know, too often training and development people, I, like David started out saying, they're in this design, deliver, they're stuck in that hamster wheel of design and deliver, they don't have time to, and nobody is asking them to do it. So, I think again it's, the training is not being expected to deliver results, so nobody, why should we worry about our training department and spending time seeing if we're getting any?\nNC:  OK, well we've covered a lot of ground bringing this to something of a conclusion. David, do you think we've shown that this is a problem worth solving?\nDH:  Oh, absolutely it is absolutely a problem worth solving. And you know, if, if, if L&D people are finding it hard to do, then, and you're finding something new, and you're learning something that's hard to do, just think about all your delegates, your learners, your employees that are going through some stuff with you, and they're finding it hard to do, you know, come on. Role model the fact that you're learning something new and you're finding it a bit of a challenge, don't be afraid to share that with, with your organisation because who knows, someone might be able to say, actually I can help you see some of this data.\nNC:  So, a quick tip from each of you to end. Robert, where do you start if you really could do a lot better with this?\nRB:  When transfer is needed, look, very often if you can get one more person using the training, as well as a person who used it well, that one person's, the consequences to the organisation will more than pay for the training for everybody. So, it's well worth, if the training is worth using and when using it makes a difference, we've got to show the difference that it's making, and then we can get more people driving toward that target. So, and very often it's not a question of training them more, it's about helping them get rid of some of the obstacles that are in front of them, if they don't have time to use it, helping managers support them, if they're not getting coaching and feedback, making sure they're getting that. But it's a problem when transfer is needed because we're trying to execute strategic initiatives of change, then it's by gosh a problem well worth solving because it will make a difference, often the difference in success or failure of an organisation.\nNC:  CIPD has got I know a lot of resources on this, some of which of course David has produced. Final tip from you then?\nDH:  So, just kind of a couple of things from me. One, read what people are saying around transfer and you know, make some time to, to absorb some of that information every week so you can transfer that. And the second, the second thing around it is you know, don't overfill your sessions with content, make some room for what people know, so don't assume you know what the answers are. So, if there's an issue with customer services in your organisation, find out what that issue really is, don't just willy nilly just put together how to deliver a great customer service, because your people might already know how to deliver it, what they need is help with overcoming some of those barriers we've talked about.\nRB:  Well, David's suggestion of a, a five minute spent talking about what will get in your way of your using this, to what extent do you think you can use it? Having and gendering that conversation, that's well worth the time versus taking those five minutes to drive more content to them.\nNC:  Wise words from Robert Brinkerhoff and David Hayden. And that's our canter through learning transfer, let's hope we all retain more than 10% of that. In fact, it's all been about learning concepts lately because last month we were discussing the value of nurturing growth mindsets, combatting fixed opinions that hold us back, and we've had some feedback from Stacey Pollock, an HR learning specialist at Shopify. She said she likes to challenge people's core assumptions with open ended questions around why they think they can or can't do something. She says this helps show them when they've got a fixed mindset, and she feels managers really aren't trained to pick up on all this, or indeed might be of a fixed mindset themselves. Well thanks for that Stacey. Until next time, from all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "“We need to cultivate a growth mindset”. It sounds motivating and uplifting, but what exactly does it mean, and just how aware are we of open and fixed mindsets? Research carried out by American psychologist, Carol Dweck, suggests that when organisations embrace and nurture an organisational culture which enables a growth mindset, employees feel more empowered and committed, while simultaneously offering far greater support for collaboration and innovation. So how can organisations shift their whole culture to support and cultivate a growth mindset?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests – Helen Deavin, Managing Director at Mathew Syed Consulting, and Isabel Duarte, Head of Leadership Development at Tucows – as we explore the science, benefits and pillars of nurturing a growth mindset in your organisation.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:23:43\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Is your place held back by too many know-it-alls from the boardroom downwards? It may be time to adjust your mindset. I'm Nigel Cassidy, and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow, tune in to a few TED Talks or mindfulness seminars and you'll probably discover that what you really, really want is, ta-da, a growth mindset. This is the belief that you could achieve far more, you can grow your talent and maybe even your intelligence through effort and learning. Doesn't everybody believe that? Well, seemingly not. Our guests today hold that fixed mindsets have a lot to answer for in the workplace. So, is this yet more pseudo-business psychology or can some useful science be deployed here to boost your business and the people who make it?\nWith us, Isabel Duarte, Head of Leadership Development for Tucows. She has deep experience in talent development and mindfulness initiatives, much of it gained in the tech world. Isabel, hello.\nIsabel Duarte: Hello.\nNC: And Helen Deavin is the MD of Matthew Syed Consulting, recognised by the British Psychological Society for its work helping organisations to benefit from growth mindsets. And hello, Helen.\nHelen Deavin: Hello.\nNC: Now, Helen, all I really know from research before this podcast is that a psychologist from Stanford University first made a distinction between outcomes when minds were open to self improvement and when they were just fixed.\nHD: That's correct, yes. So Carol Dweck wrote her first paper back in '99 from Stanford University and introduced the whole concept of fixed versus growth mindset. So really looking at people's attitudes, behaviours and beliefs, and how they can help them in terms of their personal life and their working life, or how they can actually hold them back and hold back their potential.\nNC: And Isabel, I don't know if this is controversial, because I was quite surprised that Carol Dweck's work even suggests that actual intelligence can be boosted by learning and development. Now, I was always taught, I always believed that intelligence IQ was fixed, largely dependent on genetics.\nID: Absolutely, it is not controversial, it's been proven by science that neuroplasticity is a wonderful thing that allows our brains to adapt and to learn, and to actually physically change as we are practicing certain skills or learning new skills.\nNC: So Helen, it would seem we don't have sufficient of this plasticity. If I've got this right it, kind of, matters because if people have fixed mindsets at work then they won't think it's worth the effort to try and change themselves or nurture others, come to that.\nHD: Well, yes, it's all about your thoughts, your words, and your actions. So the thoughts you have in your head very much manifest themselves in terms of the language, the words you use, and the behaviours and actions that you demonstrate. And what we look at and what we work with people to understand more is where they have more fixed mindset views around certain things that might be holding them back. So they may not want to get out of their comfort zone. They may not want to try new things because they might have a huge fear of failure and they don't want to look silly in front of others. And that can hold them back in terms of their ability to learn, as Isabel was saying. Growth mindset is all about opening yourself up to new experiences, to learn and grow from them.\nNC: Now, Isabel, I know you've worked a lot in the tech sector and this is one of them, along with finance, where you have, kind of, talent don't you? You have stars, they often get treated better than the rest, and there isn't a, kind of, great desire necessarily to grow your next people. So maybe there is something in this idea of cultures not being very open to people progressing.\nID: Yeah, I think we do have some people, some individuals who are stuck in their own way and who have been applauded so much, are very good at their particular skill set, that they came to a point where they don't think that they need to change. But that's why we need leadership that believes in growth mindset. Leadership that is going to come in and show that there is a benefit to it, that there's, that having this openness, like Helen was saying, this openness and this curiosity and the self awareness can allow us to develop, and grow, and be happier, and be more functional, and have better teams.\nNC: So Isabel, can you give me some examples of where a lack of this kind of open mindedness, curiosity I think you like to call it, causes a problem in organisation in terms of how people are managed and how things get done?\nID: Yeah. As a manager, if you have a fixed mindset you're going to be a lot more prone to seeing failures as something that can't be avoided. And you're not going to have the skill to treat it as something that you can learn from, that your team can learn from. It might cause some difficulties with change as well, because you are in this mindset of feeling like you know everything as it is, and being a little less open to adopting new behaviours.\nNC: Do you think people know they're doing this?\nID: I think by, and I wanted to hear what Helen thinks about this as well, but I think that by nature, someone with a fixed mindset won't necessarily be aware that they're in a fixed mindset because that's the whole point.\nHD: I completely agree with Isabel. We start with that self awareness piece because as your question asked before, people aren't necessarily aware that they have fixed mindset views and that's one of the reasons we develop the psychometric, because then people can take the diagnostic, they can measure it, measure themselves against this, the nine behaviours and six culture characteristics that we have. So --\nNC: So this is a piece of work that you've put together which obviously people who are your clients can get, but I mean, is this something any organisation can do for itself using tried and tested techniques?\nHD: I think back to Isabel's point, it's quite difficult for you to be self aware of whether you have fixed mindset views about certain things because it comes based on your experiences, your background, you know, how you've grown up, how well you've done at work, how well you've done at education. You can be holding yourself back. So what we do is we work with clients, exactly as Isabel said, is to start with that self awareness. Am I operating in a fixed mindset way? And then the second question is, is it holding me back? Sometimes it may not hold you back. It may not be impacting the outcomes that you want to achieve. But it is most likely that it is holding you back and therefore we work with clients to show them how they can switch from fixed mindset to growth mindset.\nAnd what I'd like to pick up on here is a phrase that actually has been coined by a great company out there that I think really shows the power of growth mindset, is Microsoft. And Satya Nadella, the CEO, talks about switching from being know-it-alls to being learn-it-alls. And I think that really encapsulates the power of growth mindset. Being open to learning whether you are a graduate, whether you are an apprentice, or whether you are a CEO, continuing to learn and grow is so critical.\nNC: Isabel, you have a lot of these difficult conversations with people when you're trying to help them open their minds. I know you go a bit more into the, sort of, mindfulness area as well. But just talk us through how people feel when they're almost confronted with the fact that, for example, they don't give people very good feedback or they don't see the possibilities or the promotion potential of people?\nID: It's definitely a delicate conversation and a delicate topic to approach. When I'm having this conversation with someone I try to, and I know I've said this word several times, but I bring up curiosity. Because curiosity is a term that isn't loaded, whether positive or a non positive or a negative way. So if you tell someone, can we look at this with curiosity, they're not going to think that I'm attacking them. And it's a lot easier to have that softness around it and to just let a little bit of space come in, a little bit of breathing room to analyse a situation and try to have some objectivity about it. Try to see where they might be holding themselves back, like Helen was saying. Try to even have some humility. I think humility's a big aspect of the growth mindset and just this approach of being open to re-appraising, to re-evaluating how you're reacting to something. So I try to bring those, I try to first open the conversation. Let the person soften a little bit and make them understand this isn't a confrontation, and then mention some practical ways in which they can re-evaluate how they're responding. And I'm sure Helen has very specific, measurable ways that she brings in as well, so I would love to hear that.\nHD: Yes, we do. And I think, just picking up on what you were saying, Isabel, first of all though, what I love is seeing a leader, sort of, self correct themselves halfway through a sentence when they're communicating. That is a great example of self awareness. Where they're starting off with a fixed mindset view and they, sort of, realise halfway through and switch it to be more growth mindset orientated. And yes, we have, our research has led that we've identified, working with Carol Dweck, nine behaviours and six cultural characteristics that we're able to measure and define, orientated around growth mindset. And that's where we also help them, because you're right Isabel, so much, it's a very tricky conversation. And so, we let the diagnostic help with that self awareness as well. To be driven a little bit by data.\nNC: So is this really fixed, Helen? Is there any argument about this? Are you actually saying that people who tick these boxes are open minded, people who don't are not?\nHD: In my opinion, it's not about being a fixed or growth mindset person. Everyone has fixed mindset views about certain aspects of their life and growth mindset views about other aspects. And that's what makes it so complicated. That's what also makes it so helpful for people to understand. Because again, it's OK to have a fixed mindset perspective, but if it's holding you back then we're showing you ways that you can change it to open up those opportunities to change things. Change your behaviour, change your outcomes.\nNC: But of course, changing organisations as a whole is very difficult. And I just wonder, Isabel, is this not really, when we're talking about growth mindset, essentially something for the individual about personal growth? Is it reasonable that an entire organisation and HR people in particular, will have the ability to change how people view the world essentially, that's what we're saying, isn't it?\nID: I think it is reasonable because this isn't a, basically what we're teaching is a way of thinking or a quality of learning. It's not necessarily changing who they are as individuals or demanding that they become these corporate drones that fit in a specific box, right? There's something to be said about teaching people new skills that they can use, whether it's in their workplace or whether it's in their home life, if they want to learn how to be a better surfer or how to be a better cook, or how, whatever it is, if you have an approach of understanding that you can learn, that you can improve, your life can be so much more rich if you're, you have that openness.\nNC: And Helen, what is your experience of HR people when they get involved in this process? Do they find it difficult to deal with these kind of issues, which are not straight forward, they're not the sort of things that you can go through, you know, box ticking exercise, whatever.\nHD: I agree, it's definitely not a box ticking exercise, and our experience has been really positive around working with our HR and L&D clients. Because they're grappling with this every day. They're grappling with how to change those behaviours that reflect on their organisational purpose and goals, and the values that they're looking to instil. And that's more and more important, as all the research shows about, you know, being purpose led organisations and having clear values that you want to be able to reinforce what you're looking to achieve. So we find, you know, working with our partners in this space, we very much partner with them to help them be part of that change process and help that organisation measure and achieve those goals as well. So it's critical to be working with them, it's, they're a key part of the sponsorship of driving these sort of programmes and driving these sort of levels of change.\nNC: This might seem a bit fatuous, but who are the hardest people to convince and change in terms of their mindset? Is it the people running the company? The board? The very senior people? Or is it the rank and file, maybe?\nHD: Oh, goodness, great question. I'd love to hear what Isabel thinks about this and her experience. I don't think you can say it's a specific level in the organisation. And that's the beauty of this. You really don't have a good understanding until you start to dig into this with people around what their mindsets are and how they manifest themselves. Because, as I say, it's built on the experiences that every individual has and that's very different. So personally, I couldn't categorise it, but I'd love to hear Isabel's view, maybe you've got a different perspective.\nID: No, I completely agree. I completely agree. It depends so much. I think it also depends so much on how we are brought up as kids. You know, if your parents encourage failure as a way to learn, for example, that's going to make you a lot more prone to seeing, to destigmatising failure and being open to failure being a source of growth. So I completely agree, it's very hard to pinpoint specific sectors or specific types of roles that are in this.\nNC: So Helen, you've talked about you do the psychometric testing, the work you do with people to show them what their qualities are and what they might be missing. How does the thing continue going on and how do you work out whether you have changed, if not the entire culture of the organisation, then certainly you've made people more curious, more willing to try new things?\nHD: So, yes, so measurement is a key part for us and we do measure obviously at the beginning with the psychometric and then we look to see different markers throughout the programme as to whether we're making an impact on individual and team's practices and their behaviours. One of the things we look for early on, and one of the things that we see changes is leaders' confidence in their ability to tackle complex and ambiguous situations. And we know that is something that very much is characteristic with a fixed mindset. And what we look as part of our programme is to see is the first milestone, are we increasing that confidence? We then look to say, how is that confidence then affecting business outcomes? How can we connect those practices and techniques to solving those problems they're trying to tackle? So yes, that's the sort of thing that we look for and that's what drives that cultural change.\nNC: And with regard to the tech companies that you work with, Isabel, can you say a bit more about what you find when you start working with people and what results you can achieve?\nID: It's interesting, because Helen has the approach, the broader approach of tackling the company as a whole and then identifying the things that we want to measure, and my actions are more on the ground, I guess you would say. I work directly with leaders. At Tucows I was Head of Leadership Development. I run the leadership programme and the coaching programme, so I coach the leaders directly on the specific areas that they want to grow and that they want to set as goals. And even if one of the goals that they mention in terms of their development and coaching isn't outspokenly expressed to be, I want a growth mindset, there is always an element of growth mindset that comes to the coaching process and to the coaching transformation. So this is always a part of my work whether the person knows it or not. so --\nNC: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.\nID: Yeah.\nNC: Is it very high up the agenda in terms of how people want to better themselves, if you like?\nID: It is in the way that if, without wanting to change or without realising that change is possible, you're not going to change, right? So as part of the coaching process, you have to have someone who feels like change is possible, who has the faith in changing and in evolving. So it is a crucial aspect of it.\nNC: So Helen, what might be the difference between a company which has a pretty fixed mindset and one where things have been opened up? I mean, what are the sort of things that we might notice if the process in improving people's mindsets worked?\nHD: So I think typically what our clients are looking for and what they're achieving is more innovative approaches to solving problems. So they tend to be more in that market leadership space, they tend to be commanding the way that the sector is run or the different client requirements. The way they, again, the way they solve problems. So that innovation, that agility, that boldness, that braveness to do things in a different way, because internally, they've been taking the time to experiment and hypothesise around different ways of doing things. They've learnt from their mistakes and that's what we're looking for is that continual evolution in terms of how they serve their clients, the language that they use, the way they approach it. So again, it's also organisations where maybe their sector is facing a massive paradigm shift and they know that they need to change their behaviours internally to respond to that paradigm shift as well. So it's those factors which keep them really ahead of the game in that sense.\nNC: Isabel, I've heard it said that companies that have a rather fixed mindset are very prone to more people, kind of, cheating, competing with each other for positions, a certain amount of deception, trying to gain an advantage, particularly when it comes to promotion.\nID: I don't know if there's a direct correlation but it doesn't surprise me if there is. In a company that fosters the growth mindset like Helen was describing, there will always be a sense of, I was going to add this on to what you were saying, in a company like that you'll also feel like people are happier at work because there is the sense of evolution and growth and not, like, again, being a drone and coming in and doing the exact same thing from 9:00 to 5:00. Because you are looking for ways to change and for ways to grow and that's part of your core tasks. So I really think that the entire company culture, it can be completely different if it's fostered in this way.\nNC: But of course, Isabel, there are some people who might actually, the truth is they don't really want to grow in a particular job and they might actually be desperately unhappy. You can't force people to be excited can you, if they don't want to be?\nID: Exactly. And that's part of the beauty of this work is that you're going to bring growth to a setting and to a group of people that you, yourself, as a coach, you can't be fixed on the growth that you expect from the people you're working with. So I have an example of, a very specific example of someone I worked with years ago and she was a people manager in a sales team at the time. And I was brought in to coach her and there were some issues with performance, and throughout her coaching work together she came to realise that actually she, all she wanted was to own a flower shop. And that put me in a very peculiar situation of having to justify to her leadership that they had brought me in to coach her and all of a sudden they're like, hang on a minute, we wanted her to do better and now all of a sudden she wants to leave.\nSo, you know, it was a matter of, again, explaining that this is part of the process. If we are wanting growth, you know, you have to walk the talk. If you are professing growth and trying to have this mindset for yourself, then you need to accept that that growth might end up showing that the people are on a different path and that they're happiness lies elsewhere. So it's definitely a job that always has surprises and that's the beauty of it.\nNC: And Helen, what does that story tell you?\nHD: What that tells me is, first of all, what a wonderful client because they've really embraced growth mindset and they've, and one of the things that we know is that organisations that embrace growth mindset tend to have high levels of trust and psychological safety. And that really encourages people to flourish and grow individually but also share their beliefs and follow their dreams, like Isabel just gave that example.\nNC: So we're almost at the end of our time. To sum up, can each of you then make just a quick final case for acting on people's mindsets and, sort of, getting them as healthy as possible? Helen, what are the benefits to an organisation?\nHD: Well, I think really it's about unlocking that potential, whether it being your personal life or your work environment, at that individual, that team, and that organisational level, and being able to, again, change your mindset, change your behaviours, change your attitudes, change your language, and therefore change your outcomes. And if that's what you're looking to achieve, then I would say growth mindset is something that is really worth understanding more about and looking at how it can help you unlock that potential.\nNC: And I suppose people who are in that zone are, sort of, worrying less about looking smart, putting more energy into their learning?\nID: Yes, definitely. And they will have a lot more things to be excited about, to be interested about, and to want to dedicate their attention to. And there's nothing but joy to be had from fostering a growth mindset.\nNC: OK. Well, if people have taken on board some of these points there's going to be some interesting conversations between HR and the people they look after in the near future. Let me thank our brilliant guests, Helen Deavin, Managing Director at Matthew Syed Consulting, and Isabel Duarte, Head of Leadership Development for Tucows.\nLast month we were talking about what post Covid employees expect to need to stop them leaving. Tom Gibby, founder of The Bot Platform says we should say goodbye to the great resignation and embrace, he says, the great adaptation. It's a last gasp for the Boomer generation bosses whose identity is tied up with the workplace.\nAnd Neil Crofts, co-founder of the Holos Change Consultancy has a little plan. Identify red lines, he says, like mentoring juniors, setting common times to be in the office and having no-one work for direct competitors. Then, he says, negotiate freedom to work flexibly with people on a case-by-case basis. Great to get that feedback, thank you very much indeed. Oh, he also says make your office really attractive with more cafes, fewer workstations and town hall meetings. Certainly agree with that.\nSo do go back and have a listen to that first show of 2022 if you didn't catch it and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts so you never miss one. Until next month, from me, Nigel Cassidy and all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 0:29:54\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: More workers than ever are quitting or planning job moves. So how can you help stem the tide that's being called The Great Resignation? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow, back in the day we put on our work outfits, left our souls at home and went into work. But something's changed. The pandemic has left us asking pretty big existential questions about how we want to live our lives. It could be why almost a quarter of UK workers are plotting a move in the next few months, according to one job agency, Randstad. Another, Robert Walters, predicts that workers who find their loyalty and hard work isn't properly recognised in their new year appraisals will walk.\nSo, are we seeing a power shift from employer to employee? Because if so, organisations are surely going to need to act if they want to retain their best staff and meet the competition.\nWell, joining our first podcast of the new year to talk about all this, I'm delighted to welcome a man with decades of senior HR experience in the Civil Service, most recently in developing the Department of International Trade's employee value proposition and recruitment brand, which he heads, it's Pete Thomas. Hello.\nPete Thomas: Hello, everyone.\nNC: Josie Cox is a writer, editor and broadcaster with a particular interest in workplace culture and equality. She's currently been based in New York City, so I hope she didn't join the exodus and walk out just to join us here back in the UK. Josie, hello.\nJosie Cox: Hello, Nigel. Lovely to be here.\nNC: And from the home team, it's the CIPD's research advisor and former HR practitioner in a technology organisation with a particular interest in work life boundaries, it's Melanie Green. Hello.\nMelanie Green: Hi, Nigel. Thanks for having me.\nNC: So, Melanie, let's start with you. The Great Resignation, well, we know it's definitely a thing in the US, in the white collar job market, and definitely it's a thing on social media. But I just wonder, before we get too excited, is there evidence that it is something on this side of the pond?\nMG: Well, I think this is something we need to, kind of, approach with a bit of caution. So official stats from the Office of National Statistics from the third quarter of 2021 suggest that yes, there are more job to job switches at the moment in the UK than pre pandemic levels. But what we haven't seen is a huge rise in people that are in work looking for a new job. And what that indicates really is perhaps when you start looking for a new job, it's perhaps a bit easier to get one. Because we know there's a context in the UK where there's record low unemployment and a huge amount of vacancies. So, while there is some evidence of job switching, it's also an employee's labour market at the moment really, at least for some employees.\nNC: So we've got a, kind of, talent crunch which could turn nasty for employers?\nMG: Potentially, yes. I mean, I think, again, we need to take that with a little pinch of salt and think about what different workers have experienced through the pandemic. So some might be looking to move jobs but, you know, we're definitely not out of the pandemic yet. Even in the past couple of weeks in the UK the situation's become really difficult again, especially for certain sectors. So for some, the last couple of years have been more about keeping a job and job security than necessarily moving jobs. So we need to just think about that when we're talking about The Great Resignation, I think.\nNC: But certainly, Josie Cox, in the United States where you've been most recently, I mean, #QuitMyJob is a thing. I think it's had 184 million views. And of course, I wonder how many people there might be regretting leaving their work so dramatically? You know, maybe having been rude about their old boss and left a bit of a trail on social media?\nJC: Yes, I'm sure there are certainly isolated incidents of that happening and you're right, social media has, you know, a lot of people have taken to social media during the pandemic. I'd assume that's got something to do with the fact that we're all deprived of social interactions. But, again, like, I would really echo what Mel's saying here in terms of actually our understanding of The Great Resignation, because it has become a sort of buzzword, a, sort of, trendy word to use on social media in a dramatic fashion. But I think it's really important that we use it as a means of exploring a much broader theme here and not just a quit rate or an unemployment rate even at that. But it's important to understand what this is actually telling us about the dynamics in labour markets and the power dynamics between employers and employees, and, you know, something that we're certainly going to explore more here, which is the way in which workers' priorities are changing and have been sort of drawn into focus as a result of the pandemic.\nNC: OK, well let's pick up on that immediately with Pete Thomas. Remote and hybrid working, as Josie's already implied, has changed us in some way. Have you picked up on this mood and how it's affected your people?\nPT: Well, I think across all of corporate life, I think we're seeing people now rediscovering things about family life, discovering about their own, how they live their lives without work. So it's, kind of, like, a flip between work life balance and life work balance now. So I think people are now starting to think about, what is it I really want from work? How can work serve my family a lot better? And I think depending on what life stage you are, workers have become much more savvy about how this employee value proposition matches what they're looking for from work.\nNC: And Melanie, these job churn figures that you spoke about earlier certainly show that it's professional young people, the Generation Z'ers, the Millennials, who in particular won't stick at jobs when overwork is coming as standard.\nMG: Again, I think this is a really interesting area when we're talking about, kind of, Generation Z and Millennials, I think what evidence shows is that throughout people's life stages, as Pete has said, people's priorities change. And it's not particularly about Millennials or Gen Z'ers having particular characteristics, it's a general trend for younger people to switch jobs for career development, as they always have. And certainly throughout different stages of your life, different things matter to different people. If you're slightly older your family responsibilities might take centre stage, and it might mean that if you've got a good thing in your current role, perhaps you've got flexibility, then you might be less likely to look for a new job, and that might be less relevant to you when you're younger. Not always, of course. People are different across different generations. But again, I think it's really important that we think about what our employees really want throughout different life stages. And also what we're giving them as an organisation to get them to stay, too.\nNC: Josie.\nJC: Yeah, I think, as Mel says, I think, you know, one of the narratives that people have tended to adopt during the pandemic is that this is Millennials or Gen Z'ers or, you know, a generational cohort that's, sort of, painted with the same brush and that generalisations are made about a particular generational cohort. And I think, again, we have to be really, really careful here because the overarching fact is that the pandemic has showed us that there's no one size fits all when it comes to work. And that is the same, you know, regardless of which generation you belong to, whether you're old or young, which sector you sit in.\nBut I do think it's fair to say, as Pete mentioned earlier, that our professional ambitions are changing. And I think that the pandemic has, sort of, cast a light on the fact that we're redefining, in many cases, what success means to us and how we define success. And I think historically we might have measured professional success in terms of money or in terms of promotions, but I do think that it's become more acceptable in society generally to talk about a need for boundaries. For work life balance, for having an opportunity and having almost the luxury, I suppose, of prioritising family over work and making those choices. Having control over the extent to which you give yourself to work and what you get out of work. And I think that that's so healthy for us as a society, and it's certainly one of the silver linings of the pandemic. That we've, sort of, normalised this attitude towards work not being, you know, the be all end all, and not being the way that we have to, sort of, create our identities either. That there's a separate between who we are at work and who we are at home.\nPT: I find this fascinating as a HR professional. And I think one of the things that a lot of your listeners will be thinking about now is, when you're thinking about your, what your employee value proposition, or your people promise, or what is the deal for your people, it's really about impact. You know, can I thrive in this organisation? What's happening for me right now in this organisation that will enable me to make a great contribution? Then I think you've got purpose, which is, can I identify with the organisation? And I think people are making choices about this now, in a way that actually they didn't do before. I think we've gone way beyond, sort of, compensation of benefits. And the last is the, kind of, the belonging. So it's, like, am I going to be in part of a community? Will I fit in? Are there people like me in it? Which is the whole strategic inclusion debate. So I think impact, purpose and belonging are the things that HR professionals really need to be thinking about in terms of constructing their roles.\nNC: I get all that, Peter, and we can talk a bit more about the proposition that you can offer people in the light of all this. But from what Mel and Josie have said, if people are wanting to rejig their lives a bit, that can create a real problem for the kind of jobs in the Civil Service where people are deeply committed, but they do have to work long hours. You can't have people who just want to take the afternoon off at a moment's notice.\nSo is there a problem about actually being able to deliver something to people where their expectations maybe have become somewhat unrealistic? We've already seen these examples of bosses demanding people physically come back to work, and even the government at one point started joining that, sort of, siren cry, which, to a lot of HR people was rather unhelpful.\nPT: Well, I'm not sure I agree actually. I think this is all about job design. I mean, I think there is plenty of work and lots of people, the traditional way to look at that is, how can I throw more time at this? But I think if we're going to be savvy HR professionals, we need to think about, well actually, what is the nature of work? How does it need to get done? You know, to what extent does it require a lot of hours, or can we be smarter? So I'm not quite sure I agree with that. I do think that you've got, you're onto something about the, sort of, predictable unpredictability that we seem to be going through. There is an element of, actually, you know, we know that we're dancing with Covid a little bit in terms of, do we go back the office? Do we stay at home? And I think people have got used to that. But I think, is this our new normal? It might well be, but I think we're just going to have to embrace the uncertainty of that.\nJC: Just further to what Pete was saying, and your question about the Civil Service and the nature of those jobs, I think one of the really important things here is to remember that the pandemic has taught us an awful lot about what it actually takes to do a job well. And I think that we'd be absolutely foolish not to remember those lessons as we, sort of, hopefully embark on a post pandemic life at some point. And that we really, kind of, reconsider why we're doing jobs the way we're doing them. And is there evidence that that's the best way to do them? Is there evidence that we have to come into the office? Is there evidence that these jobs have to be done between the hours of 9:00 to 17:00 or 9:00 to 18:00, or whatever. And I think that that's something that, you know, every organisation would be wise to really take into account.\nNC: Yeah, I'm sure you're right about that. I mean, I've seen several times where bosses have, kind of, all but acknowledged that their preconceptions about how their whole place would function have actually been turned upside down. And when people are given more responsibility and more freedom, it actually works out better than they thought.\nLet's look into a bit more of the detail with Melanie. The biggest culprits that are really making people feel they want to change jobs. You hear this phrase toxic mix. Hours, workload, bad bosses, lack of recognition. What would you say are the biggest factors that people will cite?\nMG: Well, I mean, it really depends on the type of roles people do. I think a really important thing to note here when we're talking about how the pandemic has changed the world of work is that firstly, not everyone can do their job from home. And as much as we're talking a lot about hybrid working, which we absolutely should, because for those that are doing it, it's having a huge impact on the way they do their work, but also for organisations, kind of, managing the challenges that come with longer term hybrid working. But ONS stats tell us that, you know, 60% of the workforce aren't doing their job from home. And their roles haven't changed in the same way. So we really need to think about what some of those challenges are.\nWe surveyed employees in the UK for coming up to five years now. In our Good Work Index we ask up to 6,000 people a year about their working life. So we have a really good idea of some of the challenges that people are facing. So things like workload, as you said. Of course, in industries like healthcare, that's been incredibly challenging in the past two years. Things like work life balance also an issue, particularly for people working from home. They tend to do, sort of, roles that perhaps go beyond the 9:00 to 17:00 anyway if they're in, kind of, senior managerial roles. But it's very dependent on the type of role you do. And we already know that there's inequality in how good people's jobs are, dependent on the type of job they do. So, kind of, managerial and professional roles tend to fare a lot better in terms of good work. So having more flexibility, for example. Having a higher pay. And although there are, of course, trade offs, it's all about understanding what those trade offs are and making sure that everyone has access to good quality work, whatever that looks like in their organisation.\nSo Pete was talking about job design earlier, and we know that's an absolutely crucial aspect of whether you have a good job or not. Whether you have control over your work. Whether you have autonomy, whether your workload's too high. Those things I think perhaps we don't talk about enough when we're thinking about what people want from their jobs, I think.\nNC: And talking about redesigning about how people work, Pete, often it's the technology which is the source of the frustration. Anything from, I mean, at the worst end, I suppose, surveillance people complain about, or simply that the platforms and networks are just hard to use.\nPT: Yeah, I mean, I think what we're seeing now is technology is a basic hygiene factor isn't it? And I think, for me, when I think about people who I, who my friends and family work with, so whether they're lorry drivers, where they're working in retail, as we've already heard, their work experience is very different. But the technology that they use or the equipment that they use is actually a really key part of the job. So certainly when we are looking at, I don't know, our digital professionals, the kind of equipment that they use and how reliable it is, and the platform, how stable the platform is, is kind of a critical way in which they experience way. In the same way that a lorry driver would experience their cab being safe, being state of the art, their health and wellbeing being looked after. So I think technology, just for now is, that is just basically part of the baseline standard that should all work. And I think that's really changed. At one point it was quite cool to have a shiny new phone. But now it's just, that's just the standard now.\nNC: OK, so Josie Cox, I know you talk to a lot of people about their work life, and I'm sure you've seen good and bad examples. Just start to talk us through if you can, the sort of things which employers can start to do to turn things around. Is it about changing the culture in organisations? Is it about the technology? Where should you start?\nJC: It's a great question. So, as you say, I did a lot of reporting on this this year and had the privilege of talking to a lot of different people in different sectors, in different types of jobs, and managers too. And lots of people at the CIPD of course as well. And I was actually surprised at what I found. And this kind of, you know, connects back to what we were just talking about a minute ago in terms of what has to change in order for people to be happier and to feel better about the types of jobs that they do. And I think what it boils down to is trust. Because we've been thrown into this world where people are working, and many people in isolation, but some people are not. They have to come into their offices. And it's completely changed the dynamic between managers and employees in many ways.\nAnd in the organisations where I feel like there is a real retention problem, there's often a real lack of trust as well. Trust going both ways, both from the manager to the employee and from the employee to the manager. And I think if we can recreate an environment where managers hire the employees who they know can have the autonomy and who they can trust, then that automatically creates a degree of respect, which in turn fuels motivation, belonging, all those great factors that Pete talked about a minute ago. So I think trust is this, kind of, core principle, without which you cannot create a good work environment. And I think that during the pandemic, a lot of us were thrown into work arrangements where trust was this, sort of, elusive concept that we didn't really know how to prove. And so I think if we can nail that one factor, then we can, sort of, build off that.\nNC: Any thoughts, Mel, on how you can achieve that? Because, of course, a lot of activities that people do that are now at home that might have been in the office are in many cases quite highly regulated. And it is difficult to tell people, just do what you think's right.\nMG: Yeah, so I think Josie's point's a really interesting one, about building that trust. And it goes back to something that we were talking about earlier in terms of what are the outputs that we want from people in their roles? Is it about how long you spend at your desk, or is it about what you achieve and having really clear goals and objectives and expectations of your employees? So if people are working from home, do they know what they need to deliver, and by when, and how they need to do that is up to them. That can certainly give people a lot of autonomy but it's really about that output I think that we need to be talking more about, I think the last few years have taught us that on the most part people can be trusted to get their work done. People have been incredibly productive throughout thick and thin through the pandemic.\nAnd I also wanted to pick up on another piece really, which is about the changing relationship with employees and line managers. And certainly, people professionals and managers that we've been speaking to in the past few months to understand what cross functional collaboration has looked like through Covid, is that managers are really finding that their employees' expectations of them and their employer more generally are shifting in terms of having really high expectations of what their work could and should look like, from their wellbeing, to where they can work from. So although this isn't, kind of, large scale data, I think what we are seeing is employees certainly wanting more from their employer and expecting more of them, perhaps rightly so in terms of wellbeing and where they can work. So that'll be certainly one to watch in the coming years.\nNC: And Pete, have you had any experience of persuading some of your senior managers to trust people more? Because this is all about those line managers who maybe even after Covid are still reluctant to give people that freedom, so they don't just feel like a cog in a machine. Because in the Civil Service, as in other places, a lot of the work is repetitive.\nPT: Generally speaking, we trust people to get the work done. And I think there is an element of empowerment that people have choice of how they get it done and when they get it done, within that cycle. I think the tricky thing here is that I think, if I was understanding Josie correctly and Mel correctly is, it's like, how do you get it done at a point where the manager and the employee are satisfied? So, for example, if you've got to collect children or you've got an evening commitment, can you work around it and can you share your perspective of, this is when I'm intending to get this job, so close of play now doesn't mean five o'clock. It might mean later because you're going to do something between that and schedule your day. And I think that what we're seeing here is, to go back to Josie's point, is that trust. That's a, it will get done, it might not be exactly when you expected it, as if we were in the office, but it will get done by this time.\nNC: Do you know, I read a story about an industrial tribunal and it said that the bosses were saying to an employee whenever they were at home, oh you're having one of your cosy days. And it was what they probably thought was a light remark. But you can see how that would cause an awful lot of resentment.\nPT: I think there's a lot to how this dynamic is playing out. So often, like, I was just going to talk about something Mel said about, you know, wellbeing and resilience during this time. So how we actually support employees. I think there's the difference between being robust and resilient. So there's the element of, how do you make sure that your staff know how to plan, do their project management, organise their day? And then when you get that pressure, how do they bounce back from that? So how do you make sure that no-one's overly stressed and what kind of support and care packages do you offer people? So I think there's a lot that we're seeing in this space now of how hybrid working has changed the relationship between line manager and employee. But also, to what extent that you need to make sure that they're robust and resilient as well. So you make sure that they're up to, it's their sets and reps, kind of, thing. Like, all of the things that you need to be fit for work, have you got that basic offer? And then have you got the other offer to make sure that, because you need to manage your life in such a different way now, are those, is that support in place as well?\nNC: Josie Cox, any thoughts about that?\nJC: Yeah, one thing that I would add as well, and after harping on about trust just a minute ago, just based off what Pete was just saying now, I think communication is one of these factors that is just so important. It really can't be over emphasised how important communication is in these situations. Because I think if you think about it, if you have trust, assuming you have trust, an employee should be able to say to their line manager, look, one of my kids' schools has closed because there was a Covid case. I need to be at home with my child today. I can bring my child over to my neighbour's house between 2:00 or 3:00 so I will do this really important call then. Explain the situation. The manager will have the insight, hopefully, and have the empathy to be able to understand that this is a real necessity and this is an exceptional situation.\nBut that goes both ways. If the employee feels comfortable doing that, then the manager will respect the employee more, because the employee trusts the manager. So it's, sort of, this continuous cycle. If there's plenty of communication, the chances are that the trust will be higher, and the chances are that nobody will feel out of control or like they have a lack of autonomy. So I just really think that particularly when we're working hybrid, when everyone's facing their own challenges, be that childcare, be that your own health, be that something completely different, there's absolutely no substitute for good communication. And if that communication is in place, then I just feel like everything can be more productive.\nPT: I think what Josie's touched on there is a really important point about, you know, we just need to up our game here on communications. And I think one of the toughest things has been we've seen the effects of the pandemic on people's mental health. And the ability to, like, to prioritise people who need to come into the office as opposed to people who want to come into the office. If you're sharing a flat with five people, you just, you know, you need that space to be in. Sometimes you know, that's where you, kind of, need to be able to step into that space and say, we're prioritising our staff's wellbeing so as that they can come into the office. And that's something that we never really did before. We didn't talk about things like that in the way that we do now.\nAnd I think, so in terms of the positives of what we've all been through over this last, basically last couple of years, you know, it's accelerated our use of technology. It's meant that we're having to trust each other a little bit more. We see into each other's homes and families and we see each other's children and pets. You know, there's a whole bunch of, we're doing things so differently and if you had said to me five years ago that that would happen, I would never had believed it. But we are in a different place. But with that comes that we actually need to make sure those human connections that are actually, are even stronger than they were before.\nNC: Yeah. And Melanie, if I can bring this back to the idea of The Great Resignation, which at the beginning you were relatively sceptical about as to whether it's actually happening, in that case, if this is about just essentially being more sensitive to what people want from work and heading off their concerns and providing them with a job that meets their needs, how do you, kind of, measure whether you're making progress here?\nMG: You make it sound very simple, Nigel, if only it was that easy. I think firstly I'd say we've talked a lot about communication and making sure that people are supported as individuals in all of this, which is incredibly important. And a really key linchpin of all of that is people's relationship with their line manager. So it's the line manager in many cases that will be supporting employees, will be building that trust with employees. So I think a really core thing that people professionals will need to prioritise in the coming years is supporting managers to be able to deliver that. They've got a difficult job and it's been made more difficult in the past few years by change and complexity. So I think that's the first thing I'd say.\nI think the second thing I would say about measuring if you're getting it right is I think we, kind of, know how to measure whether people are happy in their organisations pre pandemic. It's whether people are staying, why people are leaving. It's using organisational data to understand what people's pain points are. It's having more regular communication and getting all different sorts of data to answer those questions I think, that will really help us pinpoint where we need to take action. Because it will look different for all organisations.\nNC: OK. And let's get a final thought from Josie and Pete too. Josie Cox, in particular from everything that you mentioned earlier you've heard from workers and employers?\nJC: Yeah, I just think what Mel was saying just there, just this culture of transparency. Creating organisations where it's OK to voice things that are not working. And where it's OK for managers as well as employees to speak up and say, actually, no, this is not working for me. If this continues the way it does, I'm going to have to look for something else. But allowing an opportunity for something to change before it gets to that point of The Great Resignation.\nNC: And Pete, we talked at the beginning you have this grand title of raising the value proposition. How do you know you've done it?\nPT: Well, I think the first thing is, first thing I'd say is, do you know what it is? So I would be saying to HR professionals, you know, you need to be talking to your staff. You need to find out, why do they work here? Who thrives here? What are the harsh realities of working in this organisation? To find out what really matters to people. Because it's, we're so much more, as I say, than that compensation of benefits. It's like, what is your culture? What are the, kind of, the learning and development opportunities? What are the opportunities for growth here? I think there's so much that goes into the mix. So my advice to HR professionals is probably lift the hood of your organisation, having a look around and find out what's going on in there.\nNC: Great. Pete Thomas, Melanie Green and Josie Cox, excellent range of guests for our first show of the new year. So if not a Great Resignation in the UK, I think we're certainly going to see a great awakening as people's priorities, as we've heard, continue to change.\nLet me just mention some feedback on our recent podcast about what people managers should be doing about making their places more sustainable. The Evie Consultancy have got in touch. It, sort of, took our guests to task saying they felt the starting point needs to be a level deeper, challenging what the actual organisation is trying to deliver. And I'm sure we'll be returning to that theme of how HR should use its seat at the top table.\nPlease subscribe where you get your podcasts so you never miss an edition.

      "summary": "The rapid uptake of digital technology to deliver organisational learning during the pandemic has changed the L&D landscape forever. But as we move forward, how can organisations capitalise on the momentum to further embrace digital solutions and provide effective, engaging, immersive and safe learning experiences? \nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests – Andy Lancaster, Head of Learning and Development at CIPD, Gaelle Delmas-Watson, Founder at SyncSkills and Marco Faccini, Digital Learning Architect – as we discuss how people professionals can ensure that the use of technology, such as video, webinars and mobile apps, continues to evolve and enrich employees’ professional development.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:35:35\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Workplace learning has gone virtual thanks to Covid-19, but is your mix of digital courses, wall to wall webinars and video really hitting the spot? Hello, I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD Podcast.\nNow when it comes to learning and development, it was the pandemic, of course, which saw off the face to face and classroom learning that so many have been meaning to update for years. Yet now, after almost two years of make do and mend, that training mix borne out of an emergency may not be ideal. Take the CIPD's own research. It suggests that a tiny minority of organisations are making use of Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality or, even, mobile Apps. But it's not just about the digital platforms that you use, I mean are you still lecturing when you should be interacting? And how do you choose and make the switch into new technologies to better develop your workforce and meet business needs?\nSo here's ideas to raise your digital learning game. SyncSkills founder, Gaelle Watson, has been designing and supporting webinars and virtual classroom training for 15 years. She says, long before it became fashionable. Hello.\nGaelle Delmas-Watson: Hello Nigel.\nNC: Marco Faccini is a digital learning architect steeped in helping businesses to make effective use of immersive technologies from video-based learning to 3D virtual reality. Hello Marco, you are real?\nMarco Faccini: I am real, currently. So thank you Nigel and hello to Gaelle.\nNC: And from the home team, that's Andy Lancaster the Head of CIPD's Head of Learning and Development who's leading the organisation's wider new vision for L&D. Hello.\nAndy Lancaster: Hi there, great to be here, and also thanks to the other two guests for joining us today. It's a privilege to be on the panel with you. We're going to look forward to some interesting conversation.\nNC: Absolutely. And Andy I'll start with you. Covid 19, of course, as I say, it's forced the pace of change, hasn't it? And in a way, the way we train may not have been carefully considered now or even wanted.\nAL: Indeed, Covid has been a learning technology game changer and I want to start with some evidence-based insights, not just hearsay or anecdotal ideas. So at CIPD we undertake an annual learning survey which looks at trends within organisational learning. So on technology and learning we noticed, in the 2020 research, just before the pandemic broke, there was some really interesting trends around technologies. So we were seeing a real, significant increase in things like mobile, device based learning, things like virtual classrooms. Those were on the increase and we were seeing a decrease in things like instructor led learning off the job and even things like external workshops and events. So that trend towards was digital was already happening.\nNow fast forward that a year, during which we entered lockdown and many were forced into job change scenarios, either homeworking or hybrid working, and our 2021 learning surveys saw a significant acceleration in the use of digital solutions. Unsurprisingly 75% reported they were increasing their digital technologies but more noticeably for us, 80% said they planned to use more learning technologies over the next 12 months. So the speed of learning technology adoption is significant, and frankly Nigel it's not surprising. And, again, one of the other statistics which really took us aback, only about 18% said they planned to return to their pre pandemic learning strategies. So for us this shift to learning technologies we believe is significant and baked in for good.\nAnd just a few things you mentioned there about what's happening. We're seeing a real move towards virtual classes, the use of videos, podcasts and online resources. But really interestingly, there's a real move to empower learners to take more control over their learning, and I'm sure that's going to come out in the conversation. There's a real shift to connect learners in digital, social situations and we also saw a real difference between what we were terming as basic technologies: posting content on websites or learning management systems to more sophisticated users who are using apps and chat bots and virtual augmented reality. And just to kind of round off on this evidence base, what was interesting for us was the more sophisticated users of technology were almost twice as likely to report things like knowledge sharing, self directed learning, and also an increased demand in technology.\nSo without doubt, as an opener, there is a real divide now between, I guess, what I would call the vexed who may have been caught out by the pandemic and had to react, to the visionaries who now this is a very welcomed catalyst for the greater use of technology. And it's those visionaries who are seeing the greatest returns.\nNC: OK Andy, so it's pretty clear from what you say that some people have moved into the current phase with a fairly sophisticated suite of parts, if you like. Others are making do and mend with whatever they've been able to cobble together during the pandemic. So I wondered, Gaelle, whether you could pick that up for us and tell us how you think we're managing at the moment? What is the best and the worst use of current technology as we kind of move virtually, very quickly.\nGD-W: Thanks Nigel. Well it's quite interesting, isn't it? Because virtual classroom is not a new technology, it's been around for, at least, two decades and it's been on the towards maturity, least of, you know, wanted to, you know, grow for the past, well as long I've seen the reports, so for the past five or six years until the pandemic it was always the one that L&D department and HR department wanted to grow but seems to be stagnating, and then COVID hits. And then obviously everybody reversed from the day to the next to virtual learning, right?\nNow it's very interesting because we all know that we should be interacting in the virtual classroom otherwise why wouldn't we be using video, right? You record a video, people watch it, you plug a questionnaire attached to it and bang. It's an efficient way to do it. So if you ask your participants, your learner, your employees to join a live session, so synchronous session, you would expect that there is some concrete, tangible, behavioural outcome to work on. And I think intellectually we all agree on that: visionary and reactive organisations, both. However, we've got another challenge here is the facilitator. It is a very different experience to be in a virtual classroom and, also, thanks to the technology most of us can be on webcam, many choose not to be on webcam.\nNC: Oh no, this is an interesting point. Do people, kind of, in your view have the right to say, look, I don't want to switch my camera on. They might have, in their own mind, pretty good reason for that.\nGD-W: Absolutely and there's multiple reasons not to be on webcam. First the speed of the bandwidth it can affect your virtual experience, it can affect a lot of things. Some people may not be comfortable to be on webcam. I think the etiquette would like them to inform the participant they should be on webcam.\nNC: To tell them in advance, look, we would like to see you, and then that gives them less reason to refuse?\nGD-W: Absolutely or you've got the option as well to say, well we are a small group with six, eight people and I expect all of you to be on webcam. It's mandatory.\nAL: I think that's a really valid point around people's comfort zones around that. And, again, we also know that many people are working in very different environments You know, I'm lucky to be broadcasting today from a shed down the bottom of the garden, but not everybody has that. So I guess you're seeing now that the context in which people are connecting with these technologies has a huge bearing on, you know, how they're using them.\nNC: Let's bring in Marco. What's your sense of how well or badly we're actually using what has been cobbled together by many organisations because they've had to drop the face to face learning.\nMF: I think a plus from the pandemic is that we, as people, are, I'd like to think we are probably even more productive with the advent of digital. I see lots of benefits so, you know, a great example I was ill a little while ago. I suffer sometimes with cellulitis and I phoned my doctor and the doctor said, send me some photos. I put it here online and at 7 o'clock in the evening I got a phone call from the doctor and he said, yes, you don't need to come in, you've got cellulitis. Let me prescribe you some antibiotics.\nThat is a brilliant scenario there. I didn't have to travel and actually I wasn't even in the country at the time. But I think a bad element that has occurred is that a lot, and I see this a lot, a great deal, is that a lot of the digital strategy was in the early days, and Andy you may be able to talk better to this because you have more evidence than I. So mine's a lot more anecdotal, and from what I see on a typically daily, weekly basis but companies went, well, people are going to be at home.\nSo what we now need to do is create all our courses into E-learning. So everything went into E-learning, or a good, vast majority did. And that for me is a minus because not everything is best suited to E-learning. And I guess Gaelle you can probably talk a little bit because it's your expertise, you know, we don't, the online facilitation is a skill and not many people in L&D have that skill. Or that it's not something that they have had to do in the past.\nNC: Well you're right on Gaelle's area, of course, because that's one thing that she does. I think she's converted something, like, 200 people from the classroom to being effective in a virtual situation. So just before we leave this point about the current, sort of, mixed economy Gaelle. Just any other points about the best and worst use that you see at the moment, and what might be the causes of that?\nGD-W: Well, I would say that in terms of my experience is that very often, and partly due to the facilitation skills and a lot of time constraints, and too many learning objectives being packed in a one hour, two hour sessions, a lot of the interactive bits are being often shortened or ignored because we're running out of time. So the part that's really valuable for the learners are actually the part that don't happen: the breakout session, the debrief of the breakout session, the whiteboards. That's where, really, the thinking happen, that's where the engagement happen. And unfortunately this is often the things that are shortened for various reasons.\nNC: Why do you think that happens, Andy?\nAL: I think, and I'm with Gaelle on this one, what we see, often, is people dropping into presentational mode. Now many folks who have been learning and development are very adept now at working in a physical space, you know, whatever that might be: whiteboards and flipcharts and activities, and those kinds of things. It's a different, it's a different experience --\nNC: I mean you're owning that shed, Andy there?\nAL: Well, yeah, I am. Yeah, that's absolutely right and I think to Gaelle's point what we've got to do is to recognise that many people have defaulted now to presentational stuff. Now if we went to a face to face event and someone just sat there and talked to us we'd all be, kind of, oh my goodness, what are they up to? But because of the lack of experience we have, and obviously Gaelle has real experience around this and I think it's a brilliant point you've made, we now have to leverage lots of interactive techniques in the virtual classes, and many folks will struggle with that. So I think the best, Nigel, maybe is that we've gone on to virtual classes. The worst is, we've defaulted back to really old style presentation and, to Gaelle's point, there's so many brilliant technologies we can use in the virtual classes which our learners desperately need for that to be a meaningful and positive experience.\nNC: Great, well let's just have a look with Marco at some of the things which are available out there. So before we specifically look at how to refine and improve, let's get up to speed on some of these trends in L&D, I mean beyond the pandemic, I guess, as well. So just give us a taste of the whizziest stuff that people in many cases just haven't adopted, maybe because they can't afford it.\nMF: Yeah, yeah so obviously the de facto one I'll go to is virtual reality. It's something that I'm particularly passionate and I have a number of portfolio companies that do virtual reality, but putting that to one side. Virtual reality has had a number of fault storms over the last few years. So each year it's been the year of VR, it's the year of VR and that's not quite been the case, but the pandemic has made it so. And there have been more VR headsets sold in the last year, two years than has probably been sold in all the previous years.\nNC: All right, give me a very simple example. I mean maybe not, not a very large firm that's able to spend millions on this but give me a straightforward example of, say, a medium sized firm that has transformed its learning and development through VR?\nMF: So one is about people actually being able to practice to do a process. So rather than be given a video and watch this process and maybe click on some hotspots, you're actually putting something together, the physical thing albeit virtually, in VR. So you're actually practising putting something together. One of my portfolio companies is talking to a company now on how you put E bikes together. So rather than get people into a workshop for four days, they'll put on a VR headset, they'll pick up the component parts and they will put that E bike together. And of course with the advent of AI coming into play, the AI will tell you whether you're doing it or incorrectly, and will also coach you along the lines.\nAnd with the advent of things like Glue, Spatial, Facebook, who we all know about, Facebook Horizons is very good where you can be an avatar. You can either be an avatar or utilise video, but you can be an avatar. And I like the uses of avatars because it actually plays to videocalls to the question you asked earlier, rather than me physically be there without my makeup, I could utilise my avatar in this particular call. But in those, sort of, those shared collaborative spaces we can have a whiteboard. I can be in a different country. I could be in the US, I could be talking to Andy in the UK and we have a whiteboard and he would have a pen and I could take the pen from his hand and write on to the whiteboard. We could have those, everything that we do physically, face to face, we could also do virtually.\nNC: And Gaelle, I mean, I just wonder here because an organisation is able to adopt these technologies, I mean in theory they are by definition much more collaborative, much more interactive but what would you say about the outcomes. I mean we can't automatically say that because they're in use they're going to deliver the results that we want.\nGD-W: No, absolutely. I think any technology whether it's advanced technology like Marco is working with or more traditional online technology, there is an art of facilitation that needs to be acquired. And to get to this other facilitation there is a level of mastery of the tools and it's something I say, that we need to make the technology disappear. And to make the technology disappear we have to make sure that all the parts (inaudible) know how to find the tools, what's the codes? What's the code for me to actually grab the pen from Andy to write on the whiteboard? What am I supposed to do? How is it going to work? And that needs time to happen. We need either icebreakers or little way of showing people how to engage with the tools, tell them how to do it.\nAnd I think the problem with a lot of online is that we want them to cut as much time as possible, and that we cut times on what is absolutely essential which is how to master the tool. So it is definitely one of my pet talk is it make time for icebreaker, makes time to, and these days with just a tool like Zoom we assume everybody knows how to, you know, to find the chat in Zoom or to find the emoticons. But if you, if you actually, depending if you use the webinar version or regular version things are not exactly the same. And sometimes the icons disappear for whatever reason, because you haven't moved your mouse. And now you've got someone who is slightly less technology friendly who is a bit put off because they can't take part in a specific activity.\nNC: Well, it's interesting you say that because when we started doing Zooms and Teams and all that, we always had that traditional moment in the beginning, didn't we, when we would explain to somebody they hadn't got their video on or their sound wasn't working. And we kind of stopped doing that now and we get really fed up with people who aren't up to speed on that. And I can imagine that, sort of, across an organisation there could be a problem here with people just not being comfortable with even the basics.\nGD-W: It's true. And I think that's why maybe an icebreaker is actually easier to do than showing people where to find the tools. So you identified who is taking part in, you know, introduce yourself in the chat, or point something on the whiteboard, depending on, you're anticipating here what you're planning on using later, right. So you said, OK, I've decided to do a brainstorming session, they need to use the whiteboard. So as an icebreaker I'm going to make them use the whiteboard. Now I'm spotting that Andy's doing very well on the whiteboard but Nigel is not. So I'm going to say, oh Nigel, are you struggling with the whiteboard? Do you want me to explain to you? And that, I guess, is where the art of facilitation comes from. That you're not bothering people who know how to use the tools because they're already up and running but at the same time you're giving an opportunity to others to identify, you know, where they need a little bit more help.\nNC: There's so much you can do but you do need a budget. You do need a very competent IT department. What if you just can't run to that Gaelle?\nGD-W: You can do research and there are multiple options that are not expensive. And with a little bit of search, with a little bit of planning and thinking and more of giving a little bit of time to the facilitator to own, they have to see the point of using this technology. How it's going to add value to their sessions. Then, you can definitely build up some momentum with very accessible, basic technologies that can, are readily available to all.\nNC: OK, well it seems to me we've got two extremes here. We've got Gaelle helping organisations to make the best of what might be still fairly straightforward and basic technology. And, in the other corner, we've got Marco with a lot of whizzy AI and a lot of new possibilities with virtual reality. So Andy, can you kind of talk us through the process? Say, our organisation knows that we need to maybe buy some new toys, we certainly need to train people so that our L&D people can actually use them effectively. So how would you suggest that you start upgrading what you do to get better results in terms of your learning and development outcomes.\nAL: So whether we're talking about virtual classes or we're talking about virtual reality, augmented reality, any successful technological implementation has the end users at the heart of a design. It's as, for me it's as simple as that. And where, I guess, I've gone wrong in the past sometimes is I've been focussing on this from the organisational side and not the users' side. And I think if we think about, for instance, artificial intelligence where we might use online shopping or we might use online movies, or whatever, we don't even realise that we're using artificial intelligence because the technology is so set up in order for me to succeed. So I think that's a real key one for me Nigel. And I think as learning professionals we don't need to start with a blank sheet of paper on how we do this implementation. Now I know many people who listen to these podcasts are, you know, you're joining us from around the world but I just want to share something.\nThe UK Government has been pursuing a really strong digital transformation agenda which has looked at digital services for millions of people. And one thing that's really struck me is at the heart of this they talk about it's not the centre but the customer that has to be the focus. And I think that was a kind of a boom moment for me, that solutions are there to provide ease for the user and not for the organisation. And to that extent, I think, Nigel where I would start on all of these is to say we start with the user needs, if we don't know what our user needs are whether that be virtual classes or virtual reality we will not build the right thing. And therefore we need to do the right research analysis, we need to talk to our users and we can't make assumptions around that.\nAnd when you look at the UK Government, kind of, guidelines around implementation, you can find those on the internet. They also talk about the importance of understanding the context of users, where are they? How are they going to use this solution? And we need to do the hard work to make it simple. And part of that process, and I think, again, this is something I've learnt over many years of doing this is you're not going to launch the perfect thing first off. You've got to prototype this and get feedback around it. So I think my starting point, Nigel, is we've got to turn this round.\nSo often organisations come from what suits the centre in terms of getting stuff done. But we've got to reverse this around to say what really suits the user. And I think that's come through from what Gaelle said about virtual classes, through what Marco said as well. We've got to switch our design model.\nNC: And in fact, Marco, do you want to take this on. If organisations are going to get the best of some of these whizzier things, what would you say about making sure that they're going to do the job?\nMF: Well I think both Gaelle and Andy hit the nail on the head, you know. There's no point, you know, whilst I'm a big advocate of VR, for example, there's no point doing it for VR's sake, right, it's got, you've got to have the right use case and it needs to deliver the right learning outcomes. Because that's got to be front and centre. What are the learning outcomes or the business goals that we are trying to achieve from this element of learning, whatever that learning is. But I think Andy, sort of, touched on it without actually saying it, you know, and it's been my, one of my biggest bugbears is that, you know, people in L&D, you know, and some are, I would say, so it's just my view, most are, sort of, traditional thinkers. Very slow in embracing new things but also look at things very much from a silo perspective. And what I mean by that is they look at the world of learning from their viewpoint, and that's understandable because that's, they're experts at that.\nBut hang on, the world is being driven by the consumer and I would argue that every single person in our organisation is the consumer and it's, to Gaelle's point exactly, there is no point trying to introduce people to a newer form of technology if they have to click 20 times, or if they have to read a manual to switch something on. That was VR's big failing with a headset. You had to plug it into a laptop, you had to set up some beacons. Then all of a sudden PlayStation, for example, Sony PlayStation created a headset where you just plug it in to the PC. So all the, and I won't even say kids because, hey, I know people of my age who play games still, you know, you can just plug in a VR headset and you are up and running, playing that game in VR. Now with the new breed of headsets we just press a button and we're up and running. So we don't, we don't focus enough on the UX and the UI and have the user, the consumer as I call them, at the heart of everything.\nIf we do that and actually ask them what helps you learn? When do you want to learn? What makes you learn? Then we're never going to make those changes and have those newer technology adoptions.\nNC: And I wonder whether the lesson there from Marco, Gaelle, it's actually relevant even if you're not using a sophisticated platform. You were saying to me before that the technology itself ought to be invisible. What did you kind of mean by that?\nGD-W: Well exactly that is that you want to be able to plug and run whatever you join a Zoom or a Teams or, you know, you're using Miro whiteboards or, you know, VR headset. Nobody wants to be spending hours learning to master the tools. So you have to make it engaging. So now we've got also different environment and so different level of mastery of the technology, but it is the responsibility of the facilitator, of the L&D team to advise, you know, which tool is best and would be more efficient. So if you have to, if you have to, for example, do a virtual classroom for someone who is plan based, you know, you have to find them a room, you have to find them a computer, they have to, you know, start plugging in. They have to plug the thing.\nNC: Yeah, we, we tend to assume everybody's still in an office, don't we?\nGD-W: And, and it's not.\nNC: Or sitting at home.\nGD-W: Exactly, and it's not. So there's like, you know, you've got the front desk people, you know, imagine a receptionist following a virtual classroom whereas, you know, supposed to engage and picking up the phone. And, you know, I had medical officers calling me, they said, oh we want to do virtual classroom training. And I was like, OK, for the front desk. And I was like, well how are they going to do it? Is it going to be of the time work or, or in the separate office? Ah, we haven't thought about that.\nNC: OK, and Andy you've kind of listened to both points of view there. How do you think we actually go about starting to measure that any of these changes we've brought in are effective or not.\nAL: So I think when it comes to learning technologies often we go for the easy stuff and that's often around the usage of the technology. And, and I, and I get that and I've made that mistake myself. You design some E-learning, it's how many clicks, how many, how long has someone been on there. But we have to look at impact measurement of technology the same as any other area of learning. And, and for that we need just to step back and look at what the performance outcome or the business need is.\nWhat is, what's the technology supporting. So as Marco said if it's supporting people to become competent in assembly skills or whatever, we should be measuring whether the assembly skills are being done effectively and whether they're being done in a timely fashion. So I think, like, many areas of learning, what we do in terms of measuring the, the impact of digital technologies is we understand what does excellence look like and we then look at how the technology supports that. So I think that's a really important point. We're not measuring the technology we're measuring the business performance. And I think as well for, for me often I've been in a situation when we've done technological investments that senior teams, let's be honest about it, want to look at how soon can we get this kind of cost investment back again. And I think, really, what we've got to look at is how is it supporting the business improvement? So if it's trial and error learning, my goodness Marco I'm guessing some of the things you've seen where virtual reality is being used in high safety situations, you know, the cost of someone sustaining an injury or a death compared with a cost of investing in technology to support that learning it's just a, a no brainer. So I think we've got to make it very clear around those kind of things.\nNC: Yeah, I saw an excellent example of that recently with the training for the Elizabeth Line which, apparently, has largely been done through, I don't, it'd be virtual reality, I guess?\nAL: Yeah, and I think, again, that's where we've got to tie it into the business outcomes. And again, Nigel, I've seen stuff around customer service where we've done trial and error customer service learning using technology and it's great, you can go and make a mistake. It's very difficult, if you're in the middle of a customer service intervention to make a real howler of a mistake which has a reputational impact on an organisation, but again with technology we can do those things. So I think looking at those kind of measures are really important.\nAnd I guess, as well just, one thing I'd just drop in for me. I think sometimes when it comes to technology we focus a lot around quant and data, quantitative analysis. Because the technology does drive a lot of data out there which we can use. But I'm passionate about underlying stories and I think sometimes the stories of how people have benefitted from technology and, also, maybe stories around why it was maybe difficult for them to use the technology are really crucial. So I'll just throw that one in. We do need data. We need to be better focussed at harvesting and interpreting data but the stories of users and learners whose lives have been transformed for the use of technology is a powerful medium to report back to our senior leaders.\nMF: I just wanted to chime in on a couple of things that Andy said there which I feel are important: one, you know, the high risk use case for VR, totally buy that, but interestingly over the last 12 months, Andy, the biggest take up for VR has been soft skills. And a great example, and we all know it, is equality and diversity. That's a great use case. And I'm very encouraged by that because I've argued for many years coaching, not just in the UK but coaching around the world has, sort of, dropped, dropped massively. And now I've seen the advent, the uptake of coaching. So I'm, I'm very bullish about that.\nBut I think from a measurement one, and I've always argued learning and development is cyclical and I'm seeing it now. If I go back those two decades that Gaelle referenced, you know, E-learning, I managed to, you know, build an E-learning company that became the second largest in the world. And I can tell you right now for the first five, six years of that new technology it was an ROI, it was. People didn't have to do a one day training course anymore and all those ancillary costs that went with it because the E-learning cut that training time down into half, so four hours plus people didn't have to travel. It was the ROI. And for me this is the elephant in the room.\nPeople in business, and in L&D in particular, need to recognise that their companies, their profits have fallen off the cliff over the last couple of years. Or, you know, some companies in certain areas have. Therefore they are looking at cost cutting or, you know, looking at margins to be able to, you know, increase their profits back or even service debts that that they might have had to take on. So for me it's almost like going back 20 odd years. They're looking at that training that they've traditionally done that's taken days on end and looking at using digital and technology to how can we shorten that back down to, say a day, a two day course to a day's course, if you like, and therefore save some money. Now we might all find that a little bit abhorrent but, actually, there's an argument from my side that, actually, we're probably going to deliver a better solution if we can have the blend as opposed to just one or the other.\nNC: OK, so to help that delivery then a final thought from each of you, Gaelle Watson?\nGD-W: I think, Marco, it was very pertinent what you just said about the blend and, and I guess it's putting back the learners at the centre, that what we've been saying all along. And once we define learning objectives and we know where we want to go, I think learning is a social experience and we learn better, well in some topics. Some topics are informative and maybe don't need to be live, in person, and can be learned in an asynchronous way, on demand. But when we need to practice, when we need to, you know, discuss or brainstorm there're multiple options that are available. But at the moment we start using technology we need to make sure that we, we make this technology human and that we, it's facilitated in a way. So we equipped everybody, learners and facilitators, to make the best use of this technology and optimise the technology. Because the aim is to be more accessible, more inclusive and, and accelerate the learning, isn't it?\nAL: So I'm going to go back to the CIPD research with a, with a thought which has been focussed my mind over the past few months. Don't be digitally vexed. Reacting to the pandemic and change but be a digital visionary who embraces technology, eagerly embraces technology as a catalyst for delivering excellent learning. And we're seeing it's the learning teams who are becoming more sophisticated in their vision and in their digital plans that are seeing rich returns.\nMF: I think both of you have said it far better than I ever could. But I just want to take a little bit further something that Gaelle said because I totally agree with everything she said there. But it's almost, you know, we, we talk about measurement and data and analytics. I think as, as learning and development professionals we've got to look at that lesson plan or that workshop for whatever that subject is and cut it down into parts, and then look at those parts and go, what is the best delivery method for that part that's going to generate most impact? As opposed to taking a lesson and going, oh, yes, I think that will suit E-learning so we make it all E-learning.\nWe've got to look at the composite parts and deliver it in those individual parts. And I know that might, you know, add more time to the process. But I can tell you the user will benefit from it.\nNC: Brilliant, well we've had so much good advice. Thank you very much indeed all three of you to Gaelle Watson, Marco Faccini and Andy Lancaster, and in fact that is our last podcast for 2021. We're back in the New Year considering the great resignation. How far should you go to keep disenchanted staff onboard?

Help solve some of your tricker HR dilemmas and, finally, just some responses to our last edition which was on motivation, how to get your team mojo back. Gabrielle Shaw who runs a global communications agency suggests dropping everything for a bit and going for a walk or changing the mood by getting your team to brainstorm something entirely different to the problems of the day.\nAnd if that doesn't work another suggestion reached us, it was put music on as loud as possible and get everyone to dance on their desks. It's only filling in the risk assessment form that may kill that idea.

So, when motivation doesn’t always come too easily, how can people professionals find a way to recharge both themselves and reignite that spark among the workforce?",
      "summary": "Motivation can be defined as a desire or willingness to do something, but would you be able to tell that your team or an individual is struggling with motivation? Many of us may be feeling tired, overloaded and overworked and while the monotony of heading to the kitchen table can equally take its toll, what is the cost of doing nothing when it comes to tackling the challenges of low motivation?\nJoin our podcast presenter Nigel Cassidy, Perry Timms, Founder and Chief Energy Officer at People and Transformational HR (PTHR), Chris Shambrook, Director at PlanetK2 and Sally Hopper, HR Director at Hertfordshire County Council, as we explore the art of motivation and how people leaders and managers can help stimulate and reinvigorate their workforce.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:30:36\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Lacking motivation? Colleagues tired, overloaded, hardly bothered to use their hard-won skills and experience? Here's ideas to get back that lost focus, energy and commitment.\nIt's those days when you really don't want to get out of bed in the morning and things go downhill from there. Motivation is our desire or willingness to do things, and let's face it, after two testing years, many feel ground down by the physical and mental challenges that have come with the pandemic. Everything from juggling work, home life and responsibilities for others' safety to the emotional impact of isolation or loss. So how can we spot and reverse any lack of motivation which is holding our people and organisations back?\nWell, here's inspiration from firstly a coach, author, renowned blogger and all round cheerleader for the people professional. He's the founder of People and Transformational HR Limited, and advisor to the CIPD, Perry Timms. Hello.\nPerry Timms: Hello there, Nigel. Glad to be here, thank you.\nNC: Well, warming up in the corner, we've no less than a man who was a long established consultant to the GB rowing team, who helped turn it into a real medal winning machine, and with plenty of experience now helping business help learn some of the lessons from top notch sport, it's Chris Shambrook. Hello.\nChris Shambrook: Good morning, a pleasure to be here as well.\nNC: And keeping it real, somebody who's helped her teams cope, adapt and succeed in maintaining service to their public, we have Sally Hopper, Assistant Director of HR at Hertfordshire County Council. Hello.\nSally Hopper: Hi, Nigel. Good to be here.\nNC: So, Sally, let's start with you and your experience. I wonder what aspects of work and home life would you say have most caused a lack of motivation, you know either with your people or generally?\nSH: So I think when we went into the pandemic, none of us could foresee how long, just how long we'd be working from home, and, or working remotely or in difficult circumstances, and so I think that keeping the motivation going has been a definite challenge, and we really have had to rethink the way we work and the way we interact and try and keep people's spirits up through a really difficult time, Nigel.\nNC: Of course, people have been ground down through all kinds of things, haven't they, Perry Timms? And not just working from home, and a lot of us have had to do that some or all of the time, some soldiering on out with the public maybe at risk, others maybe unsupervised when they're not used to that.\nPT: So, I'm a big fan of autonomous and self managed ways of working, so I think we've had to very quickly adapt to that, but at, to the point you make about the divide, I think it's been incredible how we've put people on pedestals and called them, key workers, as heroes, and already we're starting to see some of that romanticism dissipate. So, I think there is a challenge, isn't there? About those people who keep the world moving by being in a place and those people who are still working as best they can, so there's some calibration to do there for sure.\nNC: Perry, in particular, what would you say are the tell-tale signs that it's lack of motivation which is the issue?\nPT: So, I think it's where we can spot things like deadlines slipping and creative thinking is lacking. So, somebody said to me that during the pandemic, serendipity was silent, and I think that's absolutely true. We've now got to program things like that and be very deliberate about them, so if we're looking for inventive ways to tackle those challenges Sally talked about, we're not seeing them because people aren't quite so animated about taking those challenges on. They're almost seeing, we'll kind of get through today and then just pass out in bed later on at night. So innovation and all that kind of togetherness vibe, I think, is what we can notice is missing.\nNC: And of course, Chris Shambrook, the UK rowing team would be nothing without motivation. So, talk us through how sports psychology helps us, just at this basic level, of actually identifying people who've lost their mojo, if you like.\nCS: It's interesting, because I think when we look at it from a theory perspective, we don't wait to identify people who have lost it, we just anticipate that motivation is an ongoing challenge to maintain. So that notion that we should wait for something to disappear before we start acting is just not in the elite sport mindset, you are just constantly looking to say, how do we make this body as fit as possible? How do we make this person and support their motivation as much as possible? So it's this proactive application of keep it in good health. Don't wait for it to slip before we attend to it, and then we have cultures built around that, then OK, look, everyone's job is to kind of put their hand up when they feel like it's slipping but also put their hand up when they kind of go, I'm on fire at the moment, can I help? You know, and it becomes much more of a helpful construct rather than something to fear that is disappearing.\nNC: I have heard you say Chris that an athlete wouldn't knowingly become unfit before competing, but this does rather suggest doesn't it, that performance management has slipped, whether it's your own responsibility for yourself or your managers?\nCS: That's an interesting sign, actually, because where we are taking control of our own development, there is that sense of I'm engaged. So, motivation where we've got a high quality, a focused energy that is persistent in the face of obstacles, you know? So just even that notion of can I, am I interested in my own growth and what next? Even in these challenging circumstances, can I find something that I want to get from it? And so all of those experiences that we have just give us some insight into what's my quality of autonomy at the moment? What's my quality of confidence at the moment? And how connected do I feel to other people or something that, you know? And that self determination theory was Ed Deci and Richard Ryan's work. I'd point everyone in there because it's just the most beautifully practical way of engaging with motivation in this proactive way.\nSH: Yeah, I was going to build on that and talk about Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is nearly 80 years old in 2023.\nNC: This is the idea that you need food, sleep, safety, and then things that help you belong, build your esteem and all that.\nSH: Exactly, but it did make me think about where our staff were at at that time. So usually, we're really keen to think about people's development and self actualisation and you know, making them be the best they can be, but some of their priorities were completely disrupted in the last couple of years and that affected their motivation, and learning to live with complete uncertainty is something that's affected people's motivation, because just when they think, you know, oh, it's all getting better, you know, it hasn't always been the case.\nNC: So, Perry Timms, do you think you can actually measure when motivation is the problem? Because let's face it, it may well be because the technology people are having to use doesn't work or management are just not reorganising their tasks to make their work more productive or more bearable if you like. So how do we know that it's motivation is the problem? Or indeed, do we know at all where productivity slips? Maybe motivation never gets put down as the problem.\nPT: I think there's possibly some correlations that you can look at through things like evidence and data, but I think this too complex and individualised to be very guided by a dashboard or anything like that. I think this is about how we narrate our way into understanding how we're being, so this is just --\nNC: Are you saying we can't measure it?\nPT: I'm saying it's difficult to measure a causal trail, but I think you can make correlative patterns that give you a chance to create conversations that will explore that more deeply, because I don't think it's as simple as anything like, you know, I report as motivated. Well, I might do today, but in an hour's time, I might not be, so it's a real fluctuating thing, like Chris said. I think the attention we have to bring is the agency that people have to both recognise it and correct course themselves, or as Chris said, flag it up and say, I'm on fire, I can help somebody, or I really need a conversation that's just about what matters to me right now, because I'm struggling. So I think it's a dialogic thing. So I don't want us to get too hung up on data trails, I want us to sense our way into corrective action and conversation.\nNC: Chris Sambrook?\nCS: And so it's, I regularly ask people at the moment, if your mood, thoughts and attitude were instantly sort of copied and pasted into everyone else's mindset in the organisation, how worried or delighted would you be about the motivational quality that you were working in? And that, and it's where we get that message across to people, kind of go, I probably am having an influence on how other people are thinking and feeling or vice versa. If we're all complicit in creating this what it means to be and work here, why don't we talk about that more? Why do we wait for an engagement survey to sort of record? We, we've been complicit in creating the data we're just going to share. Let's stop that. Let's just keep talking about how we're doing and what we're going to do to make today as good as possible from whatever position we are, and that much more human approach I think will get out of this way of this need to measure.\nNC: I have to say, Chris, that makes perfect sense but in the real world, Sally Hopper, things are messy, and it may well be that management, for whatever reason, cannot deliver changes, or won't deliver changes that would actually mean that people weren't so off if you like, to feel so badly let down or not motivated.\nSH: Yeah, I think things are messy and they're very unpredictable, and what we lost recently is everyday social, human interaction, and the ability to see how we are, you know, how one another are. And I think the role of line managers has been key in our workplace. A manager actually asking how you are and meaning it, there's a difference, and being curious about that individual, and I think treating the individual as an individual because it's very easy to try and measure things and make generalisations, but with motivation, there's so much complexity going on for the individual. So a good line manager is the difference between getting somebody's motivation levels, you know, to a better place than they perhaps are, and a bad manager who just lets it persist and the individual may have more of a decline. So the role of the line manager in motivation is very important. That being said, in the HR profession, we've all had to be very good at looking after our own resilience in the last few months, you know, which have been very unpredictable. So Nigel, I think it is messy, and also think that the role of the line manager shouldn't be underestimated.\nNC: Chris Shambrook, so what can line managers start doing to make progress here?\nCS: Well, so I think that they can accept that it is messy, and we're finding out how good can we be at creating a culture of good quality motivation in a non ideal set of circumstances. I regularly use the phrase that if you sound like you're a swimmer who's complaining they're getting wet at work, you probably are in the wrong job. You know? You're going to get wet.\nSo management and leadership is complex, but it doesn't mean that we should shirk away from that wonderful opportunity to see, well, how well can we bring the best of all of us within this opportunity around the complexity to give us that sense of togetherness, build confidence that we're the people to make it simpler rather than more complex, and that we're going to choose how we do that, and if we keep coming back to that then maybe we stop talking about the complexity and we start talking about our agency and focusing on how much we're feeling great about what we're doing.\nNC: I'm going to go to Perry Timms, but just your analogy there about swimming made me think about Taylorism, which I must admit I'd never heard about till I just looked a couple of things up before this podcast. This is the idea that you're just motivated by pay and threats, and that basically, most people hate their jobs. Clearly that's not true for many people, none the less, there is a sense here maybe that there's a certain inevitability in certain people being fed up, Perry Timms, I mean even not in a pandemic.\nPT: I don't think it's a given. I think it's in the design. So, I think if the way roles are designed incorporates that sense of doom and boredom, then there's something wrong in the way that job's designed because there's no variety, there's no stimulus, there's no challenge. We do not have to roboticise work. It doesn't have to be done. I've heard stories of people who are supposedly in the most menial of activities who've found a way to bring it to life and connect it to something bigger than them, so I just don't buy that at all. It's lazy design. And to your point about leaders and managers, all of a sudden, when it looked like the pandemic was starting to cessate, and we were going back into office life, lots of people in senior positions were saying, we want you back because our culture, and I thought to myself, well, when did you ever talk about culture before? Because we've been trying to push that door for a number of years. You keep saying bottom line performance. Now culture matters? There's an incongruency there, they're hijacking certain situations to get what seems to be the appropriate level of control for leaders, and it's not about control, it's about enabling and it's about finding people's North Star and lining that up through good job design.\nNC: OK, so Sally Hopper, talk a bit more about what you've done, because by all accounts, your authority, it's made a reasonable job of keeping people together and putting its mission online where it probably wasn't before and all that.\nSH: Well, I think we made a good job. Why do I think that to be true is because from the very beginning, we said a few words, which was we trust you, and that's a very powerful thing to say, and that's a very motivational thing to say as well. So. we trusted our workforce to make the right decisions in a very complex set of managing uncertainty. So that was a very good start, and then we didn't, we moved away from sort of generic statements and rules and policies and spoke to the workforce in the best way we could. So. we did videos. We also did lots of online interaction, where we said to people, you know, everyone is different, and almost giving people permission as well. So. giving people permission in the daytime, we're just about to head towards the winter as we record this podcast, and we gave staff permission in the daytime to go out and have a walk. Get a bit of fresh air before it gets dark, you know, simple, but really helping people to feel motivated and not tied to a screen all day. But I think yes, speaking to the workforce in a really thoughtful way, actually. Words matter, and just giving people that sort of autonomy is a very powerful thing and it definitely, definitely helps with motivation and I think our workforce has come through the pandemic in a good way as a result of those sort of acts of kindness, you know? Kindness should never be underestimated, it's a very powerful way of motivating people, and done well, it leads to beautiful outcomes.\nNC: Does that chime with you, Chris?\nCS: It does, it just makes me think, you know, it, it's wonderful that autonomy was able to be given, but it also says what a great job we've done of taking it away prior to that, and therefore, what we've seen a lot through the pandemic is people kind of saying, well, it's amazing how well people have done. You know, they've had freedom and choice and they haven't just slacked off and done nothing, they've actually been very good. Well, people chose to apply for a job in your organisation in the first place. They were motivated to do that, and how good a job did you do of maintaining the half life of that motivation through the way in which you engaged with them from the first? Or did you then kind of reduce it through micromanagement and processes and systems that lost the will to live, let alone get to work.\nPT: I'm going to add to that if you want to, because there is an opposite to this which is where people lent in perhaps a little bit too much, and we heard about people doing, you know, 6:00am till 6:00pm days, 8:00am till 9:00pm, whatever it was, because they were so committed and wanted to show up and make a difference, they were literally on it for more than they were before. That wasn't just the saving on commute, they were desperate to show something, that added value.\nSo, I think to Chris's point, it wasn't the slack at all. I think we had to manage people who were over working a bit, and really, really, really pushing through. So, you know, so an early example was when people said, we're all suffering Zoom fatigue. No, you're not. What you're doing is you're trying so squeeze 2019 diary management through broadband pipes, and that's not what it's meant to do. So, we didn't cull our meetings, we didn't make them shorter and more punchy, we didn't do asynchronous stuff, because we hadn't learnt how to do that. We're doing that now, and I don't hear as much about Zoom fatigue now as I used to.\nCS: For me, if I just come back as well to, we use three Cs for self determination, through control, confidence and connectedness. I think people's confidence took a hit right away, because I don't know how to do this and confidence then started to grow. Choice and control, we had our sort of personal freedoms taken away but we actually had a bit more, you know and we had different choices about how we worked and we had to work hard and being connected. So, you know, that big hit of motivation really, really, you know, started to get, then get made sense, as we then became more familiar, more in control, more confident, and, and we were connecting. But now we get the, we can go back and connect with our people, our colleagues, in the flesh, and now we can start to look at the upside of kind of choice over the sort of different working modalities.\nNC: But Chris Shambrook, given your connection with the UK rowing team, I mean, sport, it's all about results, I'm rather interested that you, in your three Cs there, I mean, you didn't really pick up on results, productivity.\nCS: Yeah, I stopped working for the rowing team a couple of years ago, but having had 22 years in the Olympic environment, results are talked about occasionally but performance is focused on obsessively every day. So, you, the competition is about being the best at getting better, which is about improving your own personal best and then you test out, well, how did we do in the scoreboard once in a while, every four years at the Olympics. But the sporting world is obsessed with proactive performance development and equally obsessed with results. The commercial world is obsessed with results.\nNC: So, Sally Hopper, during all this, have you learnt anything about how much emphasis there needs to be on people's pay packages? On how they're rewarded, because obviously that's what motivates a lot of us, and how much there is on the softer stuff like rotating tasks, team working, mentoring, all that?\nSH: So working in the public sector, pay has been a constant narrative throughout the last couple of years, and indeed, still the narrative continues, and I think that most people that come into the public sector do so with a huge sense of pride and a huge sense of wanting to do something right in their communities, and that is the absolute beauty and the privilege I've got of being the HR Director in a public sector body.\nDuring the pandemic, that didn't dissipate at all, it was amplified, and we, for example, in Hertfordshire, opened eight vaccination centres, and we did it because it felt like a brilliant contribution to make at this time, and the motivation during that period and the sense of, you know, finding solutions to difficult problems was profound. Let's hang onto that, you know, it was wonderful, and so I don't think pay is what public sector workers get out of bed for in the morning, but having said that, it's very, very important that we all have a certain quality of life and I know the CIPD does some excellent work on this, on good work, you know and that's something that's very important to get right when we think about motivation as well.\nCS: I just think that's a really beautiful example of the difference between the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation believers that often, so often get talked about in the theory, where intrinsically, we can find stuff that people connect with because they have personal meaning and there's a sense of agency and they want to, that's great, but extrinsically rewards will make a difference. Extrinsic rewards aren't as high quality motivational factors, but they're important hygiene factors, and if we can have the conversations that keep the balance between intrinsic and extrinsic factors on motivation, then we're being honest, and that's really important.\nNC: I was wondering, Perry Timms, actually, how you start these conversations with people, because not everybody's comfortable talking about motivation and all that.\nPT: I think if we look at some of the data then, talking to your evidence trial earlier on, Nigel, lots of people are being asked the question, would you have a less intense job for less pay and choose your hours and so on? And more people are saying yes to that. So, I'm not diminishing pay as a significant factor, but it's not as significant as it might have been in 2019. So, I think we've got to work with that. Yes, you have to entertain conversations and understand where people are at so you can provide the right support. I've just tabulated 40 pieces of research over the summer about this sort of thing, and in it, what people said is I want care, not perks. I don't want loads of vouchers and stuff, I want to know that I can choose my hours and have time off to look after the family. Whatever it might be, I want care, not perks, so I think we've seen a massive shift in people's expectations about what reward and recognition looks like, so I think we've got to respond to that. We started by listening, we test and experiment, adapt and then we start to replicate some of those things that really do work for people.\nNC: And all that, Sally Hopper, can be quite difficult when the workforce are at different life stages, their demands and expectations are different.\nSH: Yes, so we've got some people that are under 25 that have joined us throughout the pandemic and are wondering what, why do I need to go into that thing called the office? You know, they don't really understand or necessarily feel motivated by that, Nigel. But also, we have to be, across the whole of the public sector, we're very cognisant of the fact that people are, it has focused people's minds, as Perry says. You know, it has given people different ideas about their future, and we want to keep their skills in public sector because we've got some really highly skilled people. So definitely playing to people's, back that that what I was saying earlier about the individual, everyone is an individual and you know, let's not lose sight of that and make big generalisations that lose sight of people and complexity and individuality.\nCS: I just think of Monty Python, we're all individuals, I'm not. But anyway, so, but no, what I was thinking there as well, with the people who don't see the need to go into the office, yeah, actually, when they are able to go and interact with other people, what's going to be the reward of that? Because that, we're going to get human reward here rather than financial reward and actually, being able to look at the different contexts and they are giving us the opportunity to fill different human needs, and from a motivational perspective, I can feel a sense of belonging in a different way. So, we're looking to aggregate the influences of motivation, not have sort of just, but sort of switch on and off things.\nPT: Yeah, just to build on that, for anybody listening who hasn't found it yet, the Leesman Index is a terrific volume of research about workplace, about productivity and about what goes on there. Pretty much their conclusion over lots and lots of research, you know, 20,000 people surveyed over the last year, people, when they go to the office, have got to be able to go, what was the point in that? They've got to be able to answer that question. I think it talks exactly to what Chris said. Social cohesion, all the things that make a difference about humans in the same space, they do not want to be sat in rooms going through tick box exercises.\nStandard Chartered Bank have done lots of this at management level and said it's created a different sense of connectivity between leaders and their teams. This is the stuff we want to come to the office for. The other stuff, whether it's writing stuff of researching or even doing short meetings like this, absolutely, we can do that from home. So, I think we've got to get that rhythm and justification right.\nCS: And I've been talking to people a lot recently about, you know, identifying those things, at work, can only be done with high quality, in the workplace, so people are kind of going I can't wait to get in because I know this is why we're going there, you know? It's like so if, if I think of a heptathlete, they have to go to different bits of the stadia to sort of do their different events. So we've now got choice in the workplace, so what are the things that we do in certain contexts and not others? And if we can keep them really special. We understand performance and what that looks like in those different spaces and people increase their confidence and competence in those ways. We get a much more differentiated experience at work rather than being brought into an office to be scrutinised, to make sure that we're not slacking off, which was fundamentally why it was there.\nNC: Absolutely, I certainly get all that, but having said all this, we have been talking so far as if, essentially, this is the HR manager's responsibility, to find people who lack motivation and try and help them to achieve it again, but I mean, Sally Hopper, at the end of the day, isn't this personal responsibility? I mean, just going back to the rowing analogy, you're never going to win a medal if some mornings, you really can't be bothered.\nSH: Yeah, I think it definitely personal responsibility, Nigel, to get out of bed in the morning and love what you do.  That's a great thing, isn't it? But --\nNC: Yeah, I think probably what I'm saying here is that actually, do you really, ultimately after what two years of a pandemic, need to identify the people who are chronically without motivation?\nSH: They are presenting in, not in all cases, not exclusively, but there is a correlation with ill health. So, where that presents itself, we are focusing on that, and there can be a correlation between motivation and people's overall wellbeing, so something that we will pick up on, if that, you know, is one way of identifying it.\nPT: We have to remember that we're always in a system and it isn't just about us trying to handle our motivation, it's the system we're in. And the line manager and people around you will help you understand the impact and the pressure that's put on you by that system, and what your span of control is to make some changes and adjustments. HR's role is to take that upper view of the system and go where is this failing? And try to put some actions into place that give people the chance to then start looking after themselves, but in the motivational sense. The system needs a lot of attention.\nCS: Yeah, and, yeah, as Sally was talking, I was thinking about in the elite sport space, particularly endurance sport, where there's the physical and psychological pressure combined, when you get both of those in, and they're compromised, that's when we typically have issues where there's going to be of more ill health and certainly more immune sort of system disfunction.\nWhat was always interesting for me is that when you could sort of see that the motivation had been used up to get out of bed and to the training centre. That's when you knew that things were starting to slip a little, because there wasn't anything remaining then to actually sort of drive the rest of the day. I've got here but I'm done, rather then where motivation is in good quality, I can't wait to get into the first thing today, and everything is drawing you forward and if we keep accepting that everyone is on a constant kind of journey of fluctuating motivation, we can then talk about some of those things that might be making it a little harder to keep the good quality but also identifying when things aren't good and we can keep them, you know, keep supporting them and keep a strong foundation there.\nNC: We do seem to have a consensus here that you can have a kind of culture of motivation, if you like, but as we draw this to a close, maybe a final thought from each of you on what you might do, one thing you might do to improve that in your organisation, maybe starting with Sally.\nSH: I think the one thing that I'll continue to do is to continue to empower the workforce to make some decisions for themselves. Not try to be too controlling, which I think can be a real motivation suppressor.\nNC: And that, presumably, sometimes means managing your managers, who might be sceptical about that? Because local authorities of course are bound by endless rules for everything.\nSH: Well, it's quite easy at the moment, actually, because if we don't get this right, the work, worker will go somewhere else that is getting it right, and that's a very powerful thing to think about when we have skill shortages.\nNC: Perry?\nPT:  So, all of that, and I would say, if we're looking for trails where people's motivation is a bit lacking, they won't be leaning into learning much, because they won't have the motivation for that, so we can provide stimulus by encouraging learning, and learning in itself is a motivating factor. When you learn something else, as Chris said earlier, you get more confident, you tackle more things. So look out for those that aren't learning and nurture them towards it.\nNC: There's an excellent podcast about learning, just a couple of shows back, so have a listen to that if you haven't done so already. And a final thought from you, Chris?\nCS: Yeah, I think if it's a culture of motivation, normalise conversations that contribute to a better motivational quality. So, and you can do that, you know, by kind of like regularly checking in, how in control are you feeling? How confident are you feeling? How connected are you feeling? And what can we do to keep each of those in good shape this week? And you know, where that's normalised and that's the norm, everyone knows that they're contributing to helping the motivational glue between us stay really good, and, you know, I think it's really just let's normalise this stuff, you know? If, let's be collectively curious about how good a quality of motivation we can build and maintain.\nNC: Fantastic, well, I'm raring to go now. Thank you very much indeed to our fine podcast trio.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:28:34\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: With UK job vacancies over a million and rising, how can you win the war on talent? Here's our take on recruiting in the social media age.\nWith choppy Brexit waters whipping up a perfect storm of skill shortages, it's no wonder that as many as nine out of ten recruiters have turned to social media for at least some of their new workers. It makes sense because new skills are needed, the pandemic is changing the job market and these are places where the tech savvy talent can be found. But how can you manage recruitment drives for best results? I mean, it is such a public place, so what are the risks or the pitfalls? Cassandra Hoermann joins us from Germany, she's the People Experience Lead at Personio, a Europe wide company that specialises in automated HR software for small and medium size enterprises. Hello.\nCassandra Hoermann: Hi, thanks for having me.\nNC: And from the home team, David D'Souza, the CIPD's Membership Director, whose own social media blog was listed as one of the ten HR leaders should follow. Hello.\nDavid D'Souza: Hello, I didn't know that so that's quite exciting news, so, morning all.\nNC: I'll send you the link. Before we go any further, David, I suppose it might be helpful to be crystal clear about what we mean by recruiting through social media. I mean of course commercial job sites and boards have long moved online and you can apply just by pressing a button, but I suppose using social to fill jobs kind of goes beyond that, doesn't it? So maybe if you would, just a bit of a quick survey of this whole kind of landscape of social media recruitment?\nDDS: Yeah, it's a really interesting one because I think different people would have differing considerations as to what fits in it. You've got your platforms like LinkedIn, where professional groups gather. You've got conversational platforms like Twitter where people might go to discuss and there might be professional conversations on there, but increasingly, you're tripping into areas such as Instagram where people are promoting their brands, TikTok, if you're going to get even funkier, and then you've got sort of in between spaces, things like WhatsApp groups that might be used by professionals, where actually you might want to insert a presence in there, you might share a job. So I think we've got a range of communication tools, some of which would be classed as traditional social media, some of which are just technology that are allowing people to connect, and actually, understanding your presence in each of those across different channels is an incredibly important part of understanding actually how you're going to show up in terms of your brand and how you're going to access different candidates and talent.\nNC: I'm sure we'll talk about kind of bias in how you advertise for people and what you see about them, but just on the purely superficial level, Cassandra, this is probably showing my own bias, but I mean if you have to do a dance on TikTok to attract an employee, that might not be right, might it?\nCH: I think it depends on the people you're looking for. So the better you know your target audience and who you want to attract, you can also tailor the channels and the initiatives that you're doing. So for example, if you're looking for a lot of interns and working students joining your company, then maybe a dance on TikTok could be the right opportunity to attract them.\nNC: And of course, Cassandra, this really makes sense, doesn't it? Because I read that most people, the average person, has five or six social media accounts and I bet they look at them a lot more than they do job adverts.\nCH: Yeah, I think so, and I think what happens nowadays is that there's also like a mix happening between the usage of business networks like LinkedIn, also for kind of entertainment and reading news, and also more private channels like Instagram, Facebook or TikTok, so I think there's a huge opportunity for us also to promote our brand and also specific jobs, right? So just to get in touch with new potential talent and also engage with them.\nNC: OK, well, David, before we go into the sort of nitty gritty of using social media, let's just sort of talk more generally how it helps in trying to sort of get to this very limited pool of potential candidates now we've got this skill shortage. Why is social media coming more into play?\nDDS: I think it's coming more into play because organisations when the market's tight will look for different ways to access talent to how they've done before. The challenge is making sure, and I think Cassandra's already brought it up, making sure that they're the right channels with the right people at the end of it that you're trying to attract. So one of the things that doesn't help is a kind of spray and pray approach to recruiting, where you just try and get into as many channels as possible for as many applicants as possible. What you need is to be accessing the talent that's going to work for your business and deliver, so that could be one really hard to fill specialist role, and that requires a certain type of approach, or it could be volume but you need a certain type of skills. So you used the words kind of war for talent when we open, I'd never describe it in that way, that's quite adversarial, but you're trying to find the best place to match opportunities that you have with potential talent. So it's natural when the market constricts that organisations start to get more creative, but what they need to do is actually make sure they're marshalling their resources and their time in the right way to get the best results.\nNC: OK, so Cassandra, what are the range of things that you can do? I mean, we've already mentioned sort of traditional advertising, job boards. What's the kind of range of ways that you can reach out to people using social media? Because I'm assuming that some of this is kind of messaging about companies and what they're like to work for and what they do, as much as saying come and apply for this job.\nCH: So I think again here it really depends on what your goal is and what you're trying to reach with your initiatives, right? So you could use different channels just to advertise a job, or as David already mentioned, high volume roles, hard to fill roles and really promote and lead the people towards specific areas because you're picking up on their interests or their motivators. So then, then you're going to lead them to this specific job field, but you can also showcase your culture, for example, and the way that you work, or the benefits that you have, right? So you can really position your company the way that you feel you want talent to see you also on social, right? So I think there the, it's not limited, and it's really up to your creativity, what kind of ideas you have, and how you want to share insights about your company throughout the different channels, and then it's also totally fine, and I think also necessary, that you use a specific voice or language on the channels that you talk, right? So that you also differ your content for the different channels so that also someone who's following you on LinkedIn, Instagram and TikTok and wherever, that you make sure that he or she does not see the three, the same post three times on all channels, right? So that you really also tailor what you're talking about to the different channels.\nNC: I mean, this does seem to raise some immediate issues. David, if you're going public with your recruitment, this rather exposes your organisation, doesn't it and how it presents itself? I mean how, I hate that word authentic, but I mean, I think it's relevant here, isn't it? Does it actually look like an enticing place to work? So if you go social with your recruitment, you might need to fix quite a lot of things. I was reading, for example, a little while ago, about Intel, and how candidates had said it looked like a rather closed place, so they had to completely change how they talked about themselves, to the point where they also made a policy where they said that anybody who asked any question would get an answer.\nDDS: There's a huge part around brand risk but also opportunity in this space, and you need to balance those two things off. So it's an opportunity to tell people what you're about as an organisation. It's an opportunity to explain to people, to show people, ideally through using real life employees, what it's like to work there, but equally, you need to have a good story to tell, so you need the substance of the organisation to be a good one in the first place. So if you look at a site like Glassdoor, what it does is it casts a degree of transparency around the experience for everyone. That's beneficial to organisations that work well and it's detrimental to organisations where actually, it becomes more well known amongst the people that might be looking for jobs that they might not be a good place to work.\nSo absolutely, there is a risk, I think, Cassandra's absolutely right. You need to decide on your tone of voice, you need to decide on your responsiveness, and you need to decide if you are sitting there in the hope that you will attract candidates who notice you, whether you're intending to be proactive and go and find candidates and engage with them. All of those things are perfectly fine, but you've got choices within there, around the context of your business and what you're trying to achieve, and that will need to match with your resourcing, the resource you have available and also the technology you have available at the time as well. So some organisations will benefit from a single channel in quite a passive way, just showing we're a good place to work. Other organisations will want to be actively tracking down talent through very specific channels. So particularly in tech, for instance, there are places that you would want to go to make sure that you're fishing for the talent in the right place.\nCH: I think I agree to all of what David just said, so I think what is also great about social that the organic social is free, right? So everyone can do it and you just, yeah, you need to think of, OK, how do you want to showcase your culture, your open roles, your teams? And you can really become creative there, and it's also up to you how in depth you want to share something, or maybe also how shallow, right? So, and this usage of social, and specifically organic social then, can help you also creating a feeling of empowerment and ownership for your employees because they're going to be the ones that are involved and so they automatically act as your ambassadors for your brand and they're also spreading the word, so you can highlight them in blogs and so they can engage in your postings, and so they're your real ambassadors and they're your real power on social. So I think of course there's some pitfalls also but there is a huge opportunity for any kind of company who knows who their target group is and where to reach them.\nNC: David, we know that recruitment is pretty expensive. Is it actually quicker, is it more streamlined doing the whole process online?\nDDS: It depends what metrics you're focusing on, so yeah, yes, there's definitely an opportunity there, and not just social media but actually leveraging informal networks as well. That has a cost at times in terms of diversity, so you need to think about actually whether you're reaching out beyond your traditional talent pools. It can be far less expensive but there's an element around cost to hire and then there's an element actually around the value of the person once they're in role, so it's never just about filling a role, you know, it's about filling a role with the right person.\nSocial media, if it helps you reach different people that you wouldn't have been able to prior, increases your talent pool and allows you to select and does that in a cheaper, far more cost effective way, can be brilliant for an organisation. That won't work for every organisation. So if you are a newsagent attempting to fill a vacancy, that's a really different proposition to being a large tech organisation trying to fill a vacancy, or a retailer trying to fill a vacancy. So it's understanding your channel mix across the piece and where you want to utilise that and put the time and effort in. But certainly for many organisations, social media will be 1), a cost effective way of doing things but 2), also has the benefit of a constant presence rather than just being a single campaign.\nCH: Yeah, maybe I just also add this to what you just said, like to have a constant presence, and I think this is also key, right? So like really relying on consistency and coming up with a plan what to post, when and also aligning on continuously posting schedule so that you don't start doing something, somewhere and then people start following you but then nothing else happens, right? So this is also something to have in mind then.\nNC: And Cassandra, writing that content might not suit people used to doing traditional job descriptions, for example.\nCH: Yes, definitely not so, and also, I'd say not every recruiter is a born social media marketeer, right? So for example, when we look at our team, we have people on the team with a marketing background, with a copywriting background to really focus on what they are really good at, and then of course we work very closely together with the talent acquisition managers to get the information, and with the departments, what we really need to highlight in order to attract new talent. But at least in our team, neither of the talent acquisition managers nor the HR managers are writing our teasers and creating the content.\nDDS: If recruiting 20 or 30 years ago was the equivalent of putting a poster up on the wall and trying to get people to see that poster, this is about being in a conversation at times, and being able to interact in a way that makes sense in terms of your brand but also allows people to find out about the organisation, and that comes to the point we made earlier. There are opportunities in that, in being able to engage more fully, and there are risks, because if you do things out in the open, if you have flaws in your process, if you don't get back to candidates, those things are going to end up in the open too. So the benefit of a poster was that it was passive and quite safe, you're stepping into a much more vibrant, much more engaging, much more transparent world, and that brings with it potential pitfalls but it also brings with it masses of potential.\nNC: So for example, David, do you think that you have to give feedback to every applicant? I mean, I was speaking to a young would be lawyer the other day and she was bemoaning out of like 20, 30 applications she'd made, she had like one company actually give her feedback.\nDDS: If there is one problem that still has to be resolved by the recruiting industry as a whole, it's the quality of feedback to candidates and the quality of that experience.\nNC: But has social moved the goalpost here? Because in many ways, social communication is more democratic, isn't it? That it puts more power in everybody's hands, and doesn't going social bring with it some responsibility to, to respond better to people?\nDDS: My honest answer is no, it hasn't moved the goalposts enough. I think we've seen that because it's been around for a while and you still have that problem. What might shift the goalposts actually is the recent changes in the economy which drive organisations to try and look after those candidates better, give them a better experience as they move through the candidate journey, and not risk their brand model. So I'm hoping that will be the driver for better candidate experience, will be candidates being slightly rarer and being treated as a finite resource rather than quite disposable in some organisations.\nCH: And I also think it starts with the company recruiting itself, right? So for us, one of our values is customer empathy, and for us in recruiting our customers are our applicants and later on our employees, right? So everything that we do, we do customer centric. So what our goal is that each applicant is valued throughout the process, no matter if this person is going to get an offer at the end and starting with us or we're going to reject them. But we have certain KPIs where we say, OK, we want to answer all candidates within a specific timeframe so that that every candidate gets feedback, and any candidate can also book another feedback call if the feedback was not suitable or not 100% understandable, right? And I think as David also said, so we have a wealth of talent and it's also, it's not the employers choosing the employees, right? It's the employees choosing the employer also, and the power has changed and I think it's not only the applicant selling themselves to get the position, it's also the company selling the positions in order to get the best candidate, and I think their candidate communication and very outstanding candidate experience is key in order to attract the talent that you want.\nNC: Well, you're talking a bit about the process, here, Cassandra, so I'll just stay with you for a moment. Just thinking about a company that has recruited very traditionally, is finding it difficult to find the right candidate so they want to use more social, just very briefly talk us through the steps that they might take, and does this inevitably involve using software of some kind?\nCH: So I think there are two parts, right? So the one is the attraction part where you need to think beyond using a strategy, maybe, in your recruiting process because it will be two different softwares or two different areas where you're going to act. So if you want to use social media to attract new talent, you should definitely think of who's your target group? What is your longer term company strategy? How many people do you want to hire? Where do you want to hire them? And then also exchange with your target group to know OK, where do you meet them, online or offline? And then also, what are their motivators? Why do they join a company? And then based on all this information you can come up with your, with your own strategy and the strategy that works for your company doesn't need to work for another company.\nSo it's a very, very individual approach, and then, I always suggest starting small but consistent and then you can always go bigger, and then I think on the other side, of course it helps to use software for the whole recruiting process, right? So people can apply online and in the back end the recruiters can directly see, OK, how many applicants do we have in screening? Which of those I'd like to send to the HR interview? Or which of those I'd like to reject? And there you can directly use templates just to answer your candidates. So this saves the recruiters, of course, a lot of time, and also you can make sure that you follow up on each of them because if you get a lot of applications and you have some interviews scheduled somewhere, how, how on earth are you, do you want to be diligent there, to have the best overview where your candidates are at currently, and this also helps you get a lot of data out of your whole process, right? And yes, maybe also tools like Personio can help you manage your candidates better throughout the funnel.\nNC: So David, I mean, we're talking here about a sifting process. How do you think that's changed when you're using social?\nDDS: I think it's not just a sifting process, I think you need to look at attraction and sourcing as well. So I think there's a few things going on here. My favourite story recently being someone who was tracked down on social media and were, reached out to by a recruitment team saying we'd love for you to come and work here, you've got a good fit for the skills profile we're looking for, and they already worked at that company. So there's a kind of, you know, dropped ball there, so you've got that piece, then as Cassandra says you move through to the kind of, it might be broader attraction pieces. Brands, you know, for instance, Timpson, does that really well here. You know what that organisation is about if you follow them on social, you know what their values are, you know who they would like to recruit, and then you move through to the sifting process, but the sifting process should be multichannel. So I think that's a really important point from a D&I perspective, that by they time you get to the point that you're making selection choices, that has to be a more consistent piece that doesn't prioritise applicants from one channel over another.\nSo there's a few things going on there, but is recruitment a sifting process? I like to think it more of a matching process. I think that's possibly a more positive way of doing it. We need to appreciate that for many organisations there's a massive difference between volume and non volume in the way that you go about this. So I need to replace my CFO is a really different challenge to actually, we've got 3,000 vacancies for, you know, retail hospitality staff. So very different experiences, managed in different ways, but as I say, it, you have to reach a point where you're consistent in your process, particularly when it comes down to that selection piece.\nNC: You just have to do a different dance on TikTok, David?\nDDS: Definitely. I mean, if your senior team at the moment can't, you know, follow Strictly every week and replicate those movements, then you've got no chance whatsoever. But it is, it is about understanding who shows up in those different spaces, and how you want to access them, but it's also about understanding how you ensure that you have a breadth of talent pool, because one of the risks of social media is that there are quite tight demographics actually associated with each of the platforms that you might go to, and so you need to make sure that actually you aren't favouring one group of people over another. And that's why it's important to have it as part of a broader, multichannel approach, rather than just honing in one area which brings inherent risk.\nNC: David, when recruiting, I mean, I thought you could usually use information that somebody puts on a jobs website or a social networking site such as LinkedIn about themselves, and indeed, I was looking at a business site the other day, it was recommending monitoring your candidates on Facebook or Instagram to see how they like to spend their free time and all of that. But then I saw a warning yesterday on the Acas site about avoiding using information that's on somebody's profile to decide whether to interview them or hire them. It said you might be breaking the law if they didn't agree to you using the information in this way, or for example, if you looked at some applicant's social media profiles and not others. I mean, they quoted the example of somebody applying to be a personal assistant who was pictured on Facebook with two toddlers in a pushchair, and you might think, well, she looks a bit too young to be a mum, and Acas says that you've already started making a judgement about whether she's the best applicant, and if you decided not to interview her and she saw that you'd seen her profile, if she found out, she could argue that you were discriminating.\nDDS: It's a really interesting one, and I think it continues to develop in terms of how organisations do use those profiles. I absolutely understand that there are some jobs that are so sensitive, either in terms of media presence or the purpose of the roles that actually social media checks might be appropriate. For most roles, going beyond the things that people obviously put in their work domain, and it's quite clear at times that those things blur, but there is a fundamental difference between looking at someone's LinkedIn profile, where they're attempting to showcase their skills and aptitudes to the world around their work, and trawling through their Instagram feed to see what they get up to at the weekend, and I think organisations absolutely need to show restraint there. I mean, if you think on the one hand we've got a, you know, a movement campaign at times towards things like blind CVs, to try and make sure that actually you can't see the candidates, don't know anything about them in terms of their names beyond their capabilities to ensure a fair process, and on the other hand you've got people reaching into people's backgrounds and what they do at the weekend to try and find out more about them as people. Organisations absolutely have to show restraint. This isn't just a legal matter, this is an ethical matter.\nSo there may be some cases where it's justified, so I wouldn't out rule it as a practice completely. Certainly in the sphere of politics, for example, you'd probably want to know if people are doing things that might be incongruent or risk to the organisation, but for the most part, you need to give people the ability to have a life and a presence outside of work. Once they work for you it is, you know, if they can be connected back to your organisation there's a brand or reputational risk, that's a slightly different thing, but the idea of organisations, when someone's applying for a job, attempting to essentially do private detective work on them is distasteful, unethical, and actually will probably lead to, to the point that you made, a degree of prejudice and discrimination in process.\nNC: Cassandra, you talked earlier about the tools that you can use, both software and I suppose AI as well. How do you actually measure your success at using social media? I mean, either compared to how you used to recruit or indeed in general as to whether you are finding the best people for the job?\nCH: Also here we're using two different things and also two different metrics so I think, and when we start again on the attraction part and when we really look on social and on our post performance, most likely on how our content performs. So for example, checking our metrics like (inaudible) the growth, CTR engagement rates when it comes to the content that we are posting, and tracking monthly the post performance and then to see if we want to make adjustments based on this. And I think this, those are parts that we, that we track with usual marketing tools, and then, on the other part, we also use Personio to track our channel performance, right? So we track how many applicants do we get through all the social channels or through active sourcing or through different job boards? And we do not stop with applications, we also go further down the funnel, so when it comes to quality applications, and then also in the end, of course, hires, because this is the most important one for us, with all our initiatives, and of course here it also helps, the easier you can get those numbers the easier you can also prove that it's effective, what we are doing.\nNC: OK, and of course I feel duty bound to say that other software is available but obviously you're going to speak about the one you work with. Coming to the end of our time, so just quickly from both of you, a sort of tip really to get organisations on the right road with this. David?\nDDS: I think it's just reflecting on the context of your organisation and seeing what value you can get from different channels, and also, I think about the limitations of what you can do in those channels. So for most organisations, there will probably be some advantage to being there if you aren't already but making sure you show up in the right way, treat candidates in the right way is absolutely imperative to avoid doing damage and making sure that you're in fact enhancing your brand's reputation and ability to fill vacancies rather than moving in the other direction. So proceed with care and absolutely make sure that what you're doing is to the quality that would make you proud. So Cassandra's, you know, absolutely, right, it's about the candidate experience at the heart of it, and you are trying to get them into a place where they understand what you are, they understand why you're a great match and they'd love to join, and if you can achieve that through using social then yes, it's absolutely a way to help your organisation thrive in a really competitive environment.\nCH: Yeah, definitely, I could not agree more. So definitely, knowing who you want to attract and then maybe when it comes further on the how you're going to do it, I think, my biggest tip is be authentic and show who you are. I mean there's, there's nothing worse than selling something on social and then someone gets in touch with you or joins your company and it's nothing like you've showcased there and this is then really leading to a lot of frustration and time waste on both sides, so really being authentic. Involve your employees to generate content and use them as ambassadors and multipliers so that you can spread the word outside, and then also being consistent with what you do, and I think then you, yeah. If you take everything into consideration, what David and I said, then I think you can start, start small with social and then going big after some time.\nNC: Thank you both very much indeed. I'm sure we've experienced that in the real world. Cassandra Hoermann and David D'Souza, thank you, that's a great insight into harnessing social media, and do let us know your experience recruiting on social via LinkedIn or the podcast site, and talking of which, I must just get a plug in for our next edition.\nDo you remember the boss of Octopus Energy who said he'd no room for an HR department in his company? Well, he's Greg Jackson, he's on the next podcast in debate with our own chief, Peter Cheese, and I can't wait for that. I'll be here, so please subscribe where you get your podcast so you don't miss that or any other subsequent edition, but meanwhile from me and all of us here at the CIPD, it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

CIPD research found that less than half of L&D practitioners are integrating new learning concepts into practice. Theories about effective learning, together with insights from behavioural science and neuroscience, can inform and shape the design of effective and engaging learning. Yet, wrapping your brain around all these theories can feel overwhelming and it can be difficult to know where to start.\nJoin our podcast presenter Nigel Cassidy, Michelle Parry-Slater, Commercial Content Learning Manager at CIPD and Carl Crisostomo, Digital Learning Consultant at Carl Learns, as we delve into the world of learning theory and find out how it can breathe new life into your organisation’s L&D programme.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:24:39\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Time to ditch all that outdated training that just doesn't work very well, stay with us for a better understanding of how people learn best. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWould you believe that less than half of all the learning and development people surveyed by the CIPD said that they were using any new learning concepts in their training, no wonder workplace learning is seen by some as a bore and a chore. But of course it's the businesses that are really suffering because learning is the mechanism to close their skills gaps. So here's some inspiration for redesigning your programmes with a nod to a few learning theories and behavioural science concepts that hopefully even I can understand.\nCarl Crisostomo is a digital learning consultant land learning science vlogger, his consultancy Carl Learns helps L&D teams, brands and others to harness the power of learning science. Hello Carl.\nCarl Crisostomo: Hi Nigel.\nNC: And Michelle Parry-Slater is the CIPD's Commercial Learning Content Manager supporting the shift from traditional courses to a better mix of digital, social and face-to-face learning. Hello.\nMichelle Parry-Slater: Hi.\nNC: So Michelle I suppose L&D has all had to be delivered online because of COVID, now classroom learning is creeping back into the mix, that's good isn't it?\nMP-S: It is good as long as we learn what we've experienced over the last 18 months or so and don't forget that. I mean we had this thing where we had to suddenly in March 2020 move to online and a lot of people just lifted and shifted the face-to-face into an online space and quite frankly it didn't work. So we need to not do that same thing when we head back into face-to-face. And for me it's really around understanding how best we can blend learning across the best possible outcomes for the learners and that's why we need to know some of the learning theory that we're going to be talking about today really.\nNC: And your big bugbear is your school-style teaching?\nMP-S: Absolutely I mean many of us when we start in the professional, you know, I did back in the day, training, we stick with what we know where we've had a classroom and we forget actually classroom came about because that was all we had: we had one resource, one book, one expert at the front of the class, well that's just not the case anymore at all. The we've got a lot of information out on the internet freely available. So we've got to question how do we get learning into people in the flow of work so that they can carry on with what they're doing and get access to information when they need it.\nNC: Okay Carl can we start with a bit of learning science from you? A lot of L&D people will have been taught a few important learning theories, which of those which are most likely to crop up should we know about?\nCC: Yeah I think the best place we need to start is to have a little bit of a history lesson. Learning theories have been around a very long time, even the ancient Greeks philosophised about how our brains work and if you really want to put a stake in the ground and say, this is where proper learning theory started and most importantly when it included scientific exploration, it started with Herman Ebbinghaus in his studies on memory in the 1800s. And His forgetting curve theory states that memories weaken over time. So if you've learnt something new you'll then make no attempt to relearn that information.\nNC: Ah so this is the skills decay, when somebody teaches me a new internet platform and then three weeks later when I actually try and do it I've forgotten.\nCC: Exactly. Things just disappear after hours, days and weeks and so what we need to do is we need to stop that forgetting and Ebbinghaus' theory forms the basis of my favourite learning model actually and one of the most researched concepts in learning science something called Spaced Practice. And as the name suggests it's spacing out the practice of what you've learnt over a period of time. And this has the effect of making your memories more resistant to forgetting. And so by using spaced practice we're reconstructing what we have learnt and, more importantly, reconstructing those neural pathways that led to that learning.\nNC: So Michelle we've got these particularly famous learning theories and from that has developed a number of different learning styles and typical ways in which people are taught and you've already indicated that a lot of them are not great as far as you're concerned.\nMP-S: That is absolutely right. I mean things like learning styles per se has been debunked many a time and quite rightly so. So it becomes very problematic for the average practitioner, the average learning and development person, how do I know what's real and what's not real, what's good science and what's not so good science and how can I relate those to my work? And you're right Nigel there are many famous ones, you know, Mihaly Csikszentmihaly and his flow theory for example; Daniel Pink now with his motivational theories and human-centred design, or learning-centred design, these are all bandied around but how do you actually get a handle on them and knowing which ones you should be following and which ones you shouldn't be following, I think a lot of theory is perhaps left a little bit to instructional designers who want to follow a more structured way of doing their work so they're following Addie principles or they're following Robert Gagne principles.\nBut as quickly as I've thrown all of those out that feels very overwhelming for a practitioner and so when you're coming into L&D and you're being taught face-to-face training, as I was back in the day 20 years ago, how do you access and get through to some of that? And I defer to my good colleague here Carl around how do we make that stuff work in our everyday work because it feels like we could kind of just ignore it a little bit, is it that important, our companies aren't asking for it, our stakeholders aren't saying, 'Oh which learning theory are you using?' they are actually saying, 'What's the bottom line? Do this learning programme, whatever.' So it is easy a little bit to steer clear but I don't think that we should.\nNC: Well Carl I'd go a bit further I would say that probably the vast majority of people in HR and possibly even in L&D may have lived most of their life in blissful ignorance of all these learning theories, I mean what managers surely want they want better trained, they want smarter staff, they want better business outcomes, so tell us why they need to even bother with all that stuff?\nCC: Yeah I think one of the big things say for business is this kind of thing is needed to help, say for example, close the skill gap. I'm a big fan of the CIPD learning and skills at work reports, I've read them for the last few years and there's some great advice on how to close the skills gap. It's a huge problem for business, it's loss of productivity, it's an inhibitor to growth and training is one of the main mechanisms to close that skills gap. And so what we're doing is we're talking about creating more personal learning experiences, we're weaving learning into the flow of work, we're buying more technology, more innovative learning experiences and I also think learning science has a role to play in that, make those learning experiences as effective as possible. And we also need to teach people how to be better learners, we need to teach them how to learn to learn, which is all part of learning science. So in fact we're doing all these amazing things but we may be neglecting a few of these areas, so you're giving people a Ferrari with a Fiat 500 engine.\nNC: Okay. You're very keen on learning about learning, what do you mean by that exactly?\nCC: Yeah so this is all about understanding how to learn by using learning theory and learning science. So what we do at the moment is we learn in quite a bad way and for me learning to learn really came up when I started getting into the subject matter and a good example of it is I did a course the other day and at the beginning of the course they said it would be great if you have a background in electrical engineering and complex math problem solving, it was the fundamentals of neuroscience, and that would have scared the life out of me but I know I've got a number of techniques, a number of tricks that's going to get me through that course and I'm going to enjoy the experience and I'm going to learn a lot. So I think it's really, really important to understand how to learn, so learning to learn.\nNC: So Michelle tell us how do we start bridging the gap then between proven learning theory, things that we really should be thinking about in the design of training and actually delivering better courses?\nMP-S: I think the skills report that Carl mentioned is a good place to start but also we've got fact sheets on the CIPD website about learning theory which just gives you some direction of travel to start with and, like anything, start small. So perhaps it is just thinking about Sweller's thoughts on cognitive load, don't overload your learners. So look at a programme that you already have and see perhaps where there is load, where we're trying to do too many things, so we're trying to expect somebody to read and remember and watch video and remember and so on and so forth - I think I go back also to what Carl said earlier about spaced learning and practice, spacing out our learning has been definitely proven when we think about the pandemic that when we're taking bitesize virtual classrooms as opposed to previously a whole day in a classroom. Learning has become more impactful because people can fit that into their day job but they can also remember and practise what they've done in that learning session. So my advice is a little bit at a time, Vigotsky's scaffolding is absolutely key to this where we start small, we build a bit more, we build a bit more and we build a bit more. We can do that for ourselves as practitioners too.\nCC: Yeah I think a really nice example of that is I heard the other day from Kathryn Desmarius and she's a senior director of global education solutions at Johnson & Johnson and she's been studying learning science as part of her leadership in learning in organisations programme and she's studied learning science and now she's applying what she's learnt back in the workplace. And so what she did she took an existing sales programme, you know one of these ones where a sales training where you turn up, they fill you full of knowledge and then you're shunted off. And I've worked in sales and I've been on plenty of those in my time. But she turned it on its head. She applied spacing, which we've talked about, she also applied a model called Interleaving, where we weave different learning concepts throughout the learning experience, so you don't treat content as something that is linear, you mix it up, and that makes us work harder when we're trying to learn something. And so she used interleaving. She used spacing and she used chunking as well. So she really chunked down her content. And what she saw firstly was improvements in MPS scores. So that's what they use to measure learner engagement but also they got knowledge improvements of 80% above target. They expected a 10% increase and they smashed that target, 80% above target. So I think that's a great example of how learning science can be applied in the workplace.\nNC: I can see here Michelle the problem that you can study the learning science, the theories, but it is making that leap into practice that is really quite difficult isn't it? I mean say for example about blocking or whatever you do, I just wonder is that one reason why we saw this figure earlier 50% of training hasn't modernised, that people do find this redesigning very, very difficult?\nMP-S: Yeah I think you're absolutely right there and I think some of that is because we are not being tested or learnt on it, nobody in the business is saying what learning theory did you use; what instructional design theory have you used in putting this together? They really care more about other stuff. So I think we have an onus on us, for our own professional development, for our own professionalisation of our industry almost, to bridge that gap. And how we can do some of that is questioning about what it is that we're counting. If we're presenting figures back to our organisation that talk about number of learning hours, or number of people who went on a programme, then is that wholly relevant and is that wholly useful? Should we be saying, okay well you wanted the figure of number of learning hours, it's this number, but what is the impact measure?\nAnd if we measure better things then actually we'll need to get more professional in what we're doing, so we'll need to think about well how do we motivate people to come along to our programmes and to take part of our programmes, to finish our programmes and that might help us to start looking at motivational theories for example. But I think a lot of it is all tied up in a shift towards more modern thinking and away from that sort of classroom ritual of people coming together and learning together in large parts.\nCC: Yeah I was going to say it's hard to keep on top of new learning theories, even existing ones, and in changes to existing theories because these things are incredibly organic and I would say that learning science translators play an incredibly important role because, as Michelle pointed out, you're not taught this stuff and it's not really easy to find.\nNC: So a translator, that's a thing is it?\nCC: A learning science translator is someone who dives into the academic research and then repurposes it and repurposes what they find in a way that can be understood by, say, you and I. And they've really helped me. I think it takes a certain skillset to decipher an academic paper and, more importantly, having the ability to compare one piece of research with a whole body of research in order to form an opinion and provide advice. So people like Will Thalheimer, Clark Quinn, Paul Kirschner and Mirjam Neilan, they're doing all that hard work to make research accessible for everyone. In fact I'm currently reading Clark Quinn's book called Learning Science for Instructional Designers, and it's a great entry point for anyone who is interested in using learning science to inform their practice.\nNC: And to take that on Michelle just give us some more practical ideas for how you run this process out and how you gather the evidence and then know what changes to make with your learners and for your learners.\nMP-S: I think community is a good place, the L&D community is a really supportive and kind and generous community. So it doesn't cast aspersions if you come along and say, 'I don't know anything about this, teach me,' because by the inherent nature of the community we're all in there for teaching, for helping each other. So things like Twitter chats, the L&D insight chat, to chew over some of these sorts of issues and the CIPD communities as well chew over some of these issues. And I think that learning from each other is one way that we can all support each other understand. Because Carl is absolutely right, you look at an academic paper at Ebbinghaus, as you talked about a long time in this podcast it's really complex, it was about remembering numbers, how can you go from remembering numbers to suddenly thinking, well how does this apply to people forgetting what I taught them in an online class? So there is a certain sense of trying to apply it, but coming together as an L&D community we can work through how we can actually apply. So taking something like the forgetting curve and remembering that if we just spaced out, if we remind people regularly about these things then they'll go away.\nBut for me also some of it is knowing what's good science and what's bad science. So relying on the translators that Carl's mentioned to make sense of it for us can be really useful. And there are some really good people in this space that make it so that I can understand it. Now I'm not an academic, I came into L&D and it was only an itch of my own that I got curious about different types of learning theory, and I'm very aware that, for example, social learning works. So social learning in my understanding it's people learning from people. Why is it when people go down to the smoker's hut that they're always more engaged than those people that don't do that, and these are the sorts of things. And I'm like well how can I harness that? How can I work with that? How can I get them to have a conversation there or around the coffee machine, around learning and what's good for their work? So I investigated and found Albert Bandura had done a load of research about social learning and what that means and how we can harness it. And so there's a professional itch to scratch but we do need some help, we do need some help with that I would say.\nNC: And I was just wondering Carl what Michelle's talking about I've seen referred to as micro-training is that the same thing? Because what I'm thinking about is that if you're redesigning a big training programme you might neglect these social interactions which might actually be really important in terms of outcomes for the learners?\nCC: Yeah I pick up on the micro-training or the micro-learning piece first, often with these things, micro-learning and lots of other things that we do as part of our day-to-day practice is backed by science, we just don't know, and micro-learning is a wonderful example of that. There are a lot of definitions about micro-learning but all of them agree on one thing and that is learning done over a shorter period of time. And micro-learning essentially comes from chunking which is a strategy we use to work within the constraints of our working memory. Our working memory is where information is stored and unless we do something to firm up that knowledge, i.e. through something like space practice, it disappears out of our head. So chunking involves organising a large box of content into smaller logical segments and cognitive science research shows that chunking can improve focus, reduce the potential for overload and make it easier to remember. So there's some good science behind this stuff and micro-learning is a great example of that.\nNC: I get all that but if I was being cynical I might say you're doing that classic thing of taking something that works in practice and seeing if it works in theory. There's a sort of a slight element of self-justification about some L&D work that you're kind of grafting the science on to prove that you're all terribly grown up and everything.\nCC: Yeah I think Michelle and I have talked about this before where we're not ignoring this stuff completely often we're doing some of this stuff but we don't know that's it's science-backed and that we're spacing stuff out, everyone's suddenly beginning to space stuff out and everyone's suddenly beginning to reduce the size of content and people are taking more notice of the content they're delivering and taking big text blocks and turning them into text and graphics and doing things like that. So yeah it's stuff out there and there is science behind it, yeah you could say I'm trying to connect up what people are doing to the science but I think it's the other way round.\nMP-S: I don't want to discourage people with your challenge, which is fair enough Nigel, but if we're saying we know this works and then we're retrofitting to why does it work that's actually all right. I've spent a large proportion of my L&D career not knowing why this stuff works but knowing it works and if that's your starting position as a practitioner then great, you've got a sense of well I tried this and I've experimented with it and I understand that this has a better impact in my business. Now if you want to then go back and dig into the academia of why does this work then wonderful I really encourage you to do that. What we mustn't encourage people to do is not try, not to try to move away from the theories, the experience, the surveys that the CIPD and others so show that they don't work as well and I'm afraid seven hours sitting in a classroom doesn't work as well as seven hours spaced across a period of months with reflection, with conversations with other people - the social learning, with small videos - the micro-learning. The fact that these things are working, if we don't necessarily know all the science behind it then is that a bad thing?\nNC: Excellent case for the defence Michelle I think there. I mean I've looked up to find out what people say is wrong with workplace training and they commonly say it's too generic, it's too basic and too boring.\nMP-S: For some people that might actually be the case and I feel bad for them and I really want to encourage the L&D practitioners in their organisations to think differently. Sometimes this is because we're measured on the wrong stuff, we're measured on just put people through the course, get them on that e-learning so we can tick a compliance box. As professionals we need to be better than that and where learning theory can help us is the balance between the science and the art of L&D. So yes we can look at motivational theory, yes we can look at how to do really good instructional design, human-centred design, so we've really got our learners at the heart of the offer that we're giving them when it comes to the L&D experience and we need to balance that against what the business priorities are. It can't all just be fun and running around fields or whatever it is, it's got to be based in the business need, but it doesn't need to be boring. It shouldn't be boring, because what we know from the science is actually if we engage and we have an emotional response then we'll remember it more. So I think it's beholden on us as professionals to actually fight against the boring e-learning because we're told we need to put a thousand people through some compliance training.\nCC: And I also think, you know, this stuff makes you credible. You're in a profession, you're a practitioner, you owe it to yourself. You know I went to the dentist the other day and I was thinking about this podcast as I was staring up at the ceiling. So after the treatment I asked the dentist about the importance of keeping up with modern dentistry as part of their role and we had a discussion around various things but there was one thing they said that really stood out for me which was, if I didn't keep on top of this stuff I would get sacked. A lightbulb went off when they said that to me and I think we should be taking it as seriously as that. And fortunately no one at the moment's going to sack you but they're doing that as much for their job security as much as for the quality of the service that they deliver.\nNC: Great well we're coming near to the end of our time so just before we go from each of you maybe a final thought about how you can break down the barriers and actually make some serious improvements to the learning that you're responsible for.\nMP-S: For me I think it's don't be scared of academic theory. I'm a very pragmatic practitioner in this in that it feels ethereal and out there but just try stuff out, you know, and use people like Carl, use people like the learning scientists, Fossway is another great space and CIPD's own research and factsheets to enable the science to become a little bit more accessible so you can mix it together with your art.\nCC: Yeah I think since Ebbinghaus there's been a whole series of movements, behaviourists, cognitive and constructivists and they've all added insight and they've all improved our understanding of learning and I think you shouldn't ever, if you do start looking into this, hook yourself on one of these movements because you may like it or it may appeal to you, you should take pieces from each of them and learn from each of the movements and feed that into your own learning practice.\nNC: Well thank you very much indeed both of you, grateful thanks to Carl Crisostomo and to Michelle Parry-Slater for some great thoughts on how putting the best learning theory into practice will definitely get you some results.\nStill very current our last podcast on embedding sustainability within organisations, it prompted Jan Maskell of Investors in the Environment in the North West consultant to challenge all managers, including HR professionals to take responsibility for the environment.

While averting a planetary crisis is reason enough to act with urgency, there is also a compelling business case for doing so. So, what role must business leaders and people professionals play in embedding environmental sustainability within their organisation and what are the consequences of taking no action at all?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests – Dr Jan Maskell, Business Psychologist; James Robey, Global Head of Corporate Sustainability at Capgemini; and George May, Managing Director at Bio-Bean – as we explore how your organisation (regardless of size), can be proactive in delivering real change.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:33:03\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Building back greener, what does it take to work more sustainably and avoid squandering the lessons of the pandemic? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWell with business still generating almost a fifth of all the UK's greenhouse gas emissions there are no excuses for leaving sustainability on the back burner. Having lived through the pandemic customers and employees alike so clearly want to trade with or work for organisations pledged to build a better world. And there's also profit in purpose using cheaper renewable energy for example, selling planet friendlier products and services. So this podcast is all about taking stock of the environmental impacts of your business and putting sustainability at its heart. To help us Dr James Robey, the long-standing Global Head of Corporate Sustainability at the consulting giant Capgemini. Hello.\nJames Robey: Good morning.\nNC: Now Capgemini has 270,000 employees so right at the other end of the scale our next guest George May is MD Bio-Bean a company of just 30 people. He recycles spent coffee grounds into sustainable products on an industrial scale, well presumably not all personally! Hello.\nGeorge May: Morning Nigel.\nNC: But let's start with Jan Maskell, who's a chartered psychologist and associate of the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment who wrote the CIPD's Sustainability Guide. Hello.\nJan Maskell: Good morning.\nNC: Now Jan I was quite surprised to see some stats showing so many organisations actually not really delivering on sustainability, I mean not even matching their own workers' values or expectations, and this of course in spite of everything that's going on at the moment, the current consciousness, governments and UN initiatives and everything, I mean do organisations not recognise the risks of not taking action, I mean what's going on here?\nJM: I think you're right that a lot of organisations, whilst recognising that climate change is happening don't necessarily see the connection between the weird weather events that we're experiencing at the moment and what they're organisation contributes to that and I think even those organisations that are doing things don't necessarily see the role that HR has to play in that and that's the reason why I created the guide for the CIPD is I think that HR has a huge role to play in this but I think that we don't necessarily recognise this as an emergency in the same way that we did the pandemic so we're responding to it differently. I think there is growing awareness, I think over the last couple of years there has been a huge role played by individuals and organisations, so the Greta effect, as well as things like Extinction Rebellion, whether or not you agree with them they have brought things to the public domain. And increasingly on media, recognising that Sky has a programme every day on this issue and it's already daily in the news on the BBC. So I think it is becoming much more of an issue that people are aware of but it's making that link between this is an issue and, what does that mean for my organisation?\nSo there's two ways you could look at this: one is what impact will climate change have on my organisation? And that could be directly in terms of flooding, weather events, health impacts, or down the supply chain. I was talking to someone in the fashion industry the other day who was recognising that there are serious weather effects that will affect their supply chain in other countries. I think that organisations don't necessarily recognise this as an emergency and then don't necessarily realise what they can do about it.\nNC: Well Dr James Robey it's interesting to hear Jan talk there about recent events, I mean for years you were pushing targets and then suddenly along came COVID-19 and we're travelling less, we're eating, we're staying local, I mean I gather that 95% of Capgemini staff are able to work from home, obviously that's not true of organisations that have a lot more customer-facing roles, manufacturing, that kind of thing, but I mean as far as you're concerned close the offices, job done!\nJR: Partly, but certainly not totally job done. I mean from my perspective and clearly COVID has had a massive impact on many organisations and certainly in the professional services industry it's been quite transformative in terms of switching people to a much more remote, much more work from home model, but clearly professional services organisations have a relatively modest carbon footprint themselves but often work with organisations which have much larger carbon footprints. So absolutely we have a responsibility to keep driving down the carbon impacts from our offices and from travel, and clearly we are very locked down at the moment but we do expect that to return to some increased level of travel and increased level of office use in the future.\nThe other focus for organisations is to think about the bigger impacts through their value chain. So whether it's thinking about the products and services you buy or the products or services you deliver to your clients. And we're increasingly working with our clients on their sustainability agendas. If we work with, say, a leading auto manufacturer that organisation may have a carbon footprint which is 100, 200, even 300 times the size of Capgemini's footprint, so again the opportunity for making an even more material impact is quite significant.\nNC: And I know you're pledged to work at speed to be a net zero business. Just remind us what that is and I mean is it really based on science or are you just buying carbon credits and offsetting to make people feel better?\nJR: So I think it's a really good question and there's been lots of debate about net zero, it's still in some places quite a contentious term, we're trying to align with the emerging consensus led by organisations like the CDP and the Science-Based Targets Initiative and for me there's three parts to net zero and it absolutely starts with reduction. So in the first place you have to first of all quantify your impacts, measure your impacts and set targets which are aligned with the 1.5 degree climate science, so we have targets signed off by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, SBTI, in line with the Paris agreement, in line with that 1.5 degree pathway. So that's number one.\nSecondly you have to deliver on those targets, it's no good just having the targets, you have to drive down your targets over the medium term. So our net zero target is 2030 because we believe a ten year horizon is a sensible horizon for driving down our emissions.\nAnd then thirdly you need to compensate your residual emissions. So if it is impossible for your organisation to get to absolute zero, and recognising that there are certain processes, certain actions which that's not possible with then you compensate your residual emissions. But Nigel, very much compensation and offset is last, targets and reduction has to come first.\nNC: Nonetheless there's quite a lot of science and analysis in there and you're a big firm, that's kind of what you do, George May yours is a firm of 30 people, now while this Bio-Bean activity clearly is sustainable by design I would imagine that your actual day to day business is not necessarily automatically sustainable in terms of its practices, its energy use and engaging your staff with all that?\nGM: I think that's right. So yes like you say inherently what we do is sustainable, it's environmentally focused, the purpose of the business is to create big change that lasts through recycling spent coffee grounds, through valorising something that's previously a waste. So that is inherently sustainable, inherently environmentally friendly, but the challenge for us is we are an SME, we are a manufacturing business, what we are doing hasn't been done before, so there's been a lot of trial and error with machinery and plant and different processes, so yes there is a challenge there in that obviously we have a carbon footprint in terms of what we do and how we do it. And I think you're right as well to touch on that piece around engagement of staff and colleagues and it doesn't automatically flow that just because you are an inherently environmentally sustainable business that all colleagues in the team will have the same views on life.\nSo we've done a number of different things, we are, and as much as I dislike the phrase, we are on a journey, on a path towards improving how we do what we do. We have undertaken a life cycle analysis that doesn't include our Scope 3 emissions, it's not something that at the moment we are in a position to be able to undertake that analysis unfortunately, just the resourcing of the business. We have a sustainability improvement plan internally. We are a B corporation, we've taken the results of our B impact assessment and undertaken a gap analysis to see where those areas of improvement are. We've listened to staff from internal staff engagement surveys to see where they feel we can do better and we've put in place a plan to try and move forward. We also have the ISO Standard 14001, the environmental management system to give us a framework to operate to. So we're doing quite a lot and it's important to us that not only is the business inherently good and environmentally sustainable but that we try and improve our impact day to day.\nNC: If we have time perhaps we'll go back to this question of being a B corporation or using any of that kind of analysis to see where you are and see how you can improve, but Jan Maskell let's really begin at the beginning, how do you start evaluating the environment impact of your operation and the effectiveness of what you might already be doing?\nJM: I think James and George have talked about this in terms of starting off with measuring what you currently do. So there's lots of ways you can do that in terms of looking at your resource use, looking at your travel, looking at your energy and looking at your investment, that's often missed off the list of things that people look at and that's particularly relevant to HR. So I think in an organisation, even if, and thinking about James and George's organisations, it's seeing that there's a role for everyone in this, this isn't just something that the sustainability professional does or the facilities management person does, this is relevant to all employees and this is where HR comes in, in that HR professionals are in a unique position in any organisation in that they're probably the only part of a company that has a connection with every single employee at some point, now whether that's to do with recruitment, selection, pay, benefits, performance management, HR is able to engage with all employees.\nSo it was interesting when George was saying about engaging with employees that 14001 doesn't necessarily enable you to do that, 14001 is a good measure and it's a good start but it doesn't necessarily encourage engagement with employees, and I think that's a key thing that HR professionals can bring to this and the significant leadership role that they can play in this.\nNC: And George May of course you are the HR department and quite a lot of the other departments yourself as well.\nGM: Yeah and it's a really good point, so 14001 is a framework, it gives you a framework to operate to and it gives you guidance, it gives you direction, it doesn't automatically lead to engagement. And we're an SME in every sense and we don't have a head of sustainability or similar, we don't actually have an in-house HR function either. We have two directors, myself and a colleague of mine and we effectively are the HR department between us. So then the engagement piece therefore becomes really important and I think from a small business perspective if you're looking at environmental improvement, day to day in a business, getting that buy-in is hugely important.\nSo our sustainability improvement plan is not headed by Pete, my co-director, or myself, it's headed by our head of marketing, our HSEQ lead and one of our finance team. So what we've done we've found champions within the business who can fill that role and that helps with the engagement piece. That draws people in, making sure that questions in the staff engagement survey try to draw out areas for improvement and that then we show that we are taking that on board and acting in response to those. Again that helps drive that engagement I think.\nSo I completely agree the engagement is crucial and in businesses where you have sustainability professionals, where you have HR professionals, I couldn't agree more they have a huge role to play, in smaller businesses I think it's about making sure you find the champions, that you acknowledge as well that this tends to fall outside of people's day to day jobs in some instances, you know, if you don't have a sustainability individual then it's an add on to people's role, so you need to find those who want to do it.\nJM: Yeah I think there are some really good points there George thank you. The question you asked Nigel was about the gaps and I think what any organisation can do is look at what do we currently do in terms of our policies and procedures and rather than bringing in new things how can we integrate environmental sustainability into what we currently do well. So if you already have something like a competency framework have a look at that and see where does it relate to things that could be deemed to be ethical or around environmental sustainability, any maybe enhance those.\nSimilarly if you've got training and development in your organisation and learning opportunities, even in induction, do we cover what our approach is to environmental sustainability? So where is it in the job description; where is it in the personal specifications, so is it listed as things that people do or is it knowledge requirements? So right throughout the HR piece there are ways in which environmental sustainability can be integrated into what's currently done. And I think it's an important point not to see it as an add on, so see it more like equality, diversity and inclusion, which back in the day was seen as something extra to do or health and safety as something extra to do, so you look at your HR practices through an EDI lens or a health and safety lens, so you look at all of those practices through a sustainability lens and say, what's the impact of doing this in terms of thinking about learning and development? So you look at that in terms of what's the content of our learning and development offer but also the process by which we deliver it. So what's the content? What do we talk about? How do we integrate sustainability into everything from induction through to leadership development and also how do we deliver that? Do we send people off to expensive programmes in Switzerland or do we deliver that through online methods?\nNC: And James Robey I was quite struck by something you said to me just before we started the podcast about things which are very obvious to people and things which are hidden with the example say that the data centre may be busy guzzling energy 24/7 yet people are probably more likely to complain about the use of single use coffee cups.\nJR: So yes let me build on that and build on some of the points which we've just been talking about. So I think in terms of thinking about the sustainability of your organisation I think a lot of what we've been talking about is absolutely right in terms of, if you like, eco efficiency, how do we make what we're doing more efficient? But I think the starting point for many organisations needs to be a level deeper and actually looking at what are they trying to deliver as an organisation and is that inherently sustainable or not sustainable and actually how can you potentially redesign your business about the service or the underlying service or product that you are trying to deliver?\nFor example most of us own washing machines, we don't actually really want to own 75 kilos of metal and plastic what we actually want to own is the ability to have clean clothes. Most of us have cars and think about you get in the car and you drive from London to Birmingham, you end up moving 1500 kilos of metal and other components to move 75 kilos of you from A to B. So again inherently the process you're trying to do, which is move yourself from A to B has a huge level of inefficiency around it just because of the way we're framing it and looking at it.\nSo I think for me when you start thinking about it from an organisational perspective in terms of that sustainability journey you need to start by looking at the underlying product or service that you are trying to deliver and then just challenge yourself in terms of how you're doing it. A very interesting conversation a few years ago with a chief executive from a major airline who was thinking about investing in video conferencing because the underlying business model they had was about connecting business around the world and traditionally as an airline you did that by putting people in thin aluminium tubes and flying them from A to B and he was trying to explore well actually is there a different way of connecting business people which didn't involve putting them in thin aluminium tubes and blasting them around the world? So again that was just a step back before you then drive into the efficiency side which Jan and George talked a lot about in terms of understanding your business and looking for where you can be more efficient.\nBut I think coming on to your other point Nigel in terms of the visible and the invisible and I think, particularly in larger organisations where initiatives aren't often visible to everybody you need to make sure you have that spectrum, you need to do both the visible things, the taking away the plastic cups, putting in place recycling bins which are highly visible as well as the impacts, you know, the things you do as an organisation which have the biggest impact, so use the example there of data centres, for organisations that run data centres they use huge amounts of energy, they have a very large environmental impact in fact if you looked at the energy consumption of the IT industry it would that we would be the third largest country in the world in terms of our energy consumption, so clearly there's a responsibility for work there.\nNC: Because it can George May be seen as kind of green-wash, I mean I keep seeing stuff about initiatives by major soft drinks manufacturers, I mean basically they're producing vast quantities of plastic bottles that may not get recycled. So such a massive undertaking and you can very easily confuse or mislead your consumers.\nGM: Yes I think you definitely can. I think there's an interesting role to play by big brands in the drive to sustainability and more sustainable ways of doing business in that my personal view is that the brands have a really big role to play. People follow where brands lead, I think legislation is a sort of secondary factor in all of this and it's the stick not the carrot. So yes you're right that is the case and I think I suppose when I look at our business we're not quite at that scale yet but we try to make sure that we align, I suppose to James' point that we try to align what we do and the way that we do it with the kind of business that we want to be.\nWe sell a domestic solid fuel for stoves and wood burners, everyone in that market, bar no one, sells it in plastic bags, we have made a point of selling it in a paper bag that is more readily recycled, that is FFC approved. Now I'm sure there are holes that can be picked in using plastic over paper, I can probably see Jan and James smirking already but we deliberately do that because we want to make the point, you know, to challenge the norms to try and tell a story in the way that we do things, trying to make sure that the way we approach our business is consistent with the overarching purpose of the business. And yes we've definitely got a way to go. We want to make sure that we source sustainably, that when we're choosing suppliers we consider their impact, all of those things.\nSo it is difficult. I think it's a minefield and I think probably whatever you do you'll always get it slightly wrong but I think the main thing is that you're engaging your workforce, that you are moving forward and you're putting in place legitimate bona fide activities that do have an impact and that's crucial, whether that's, and we talked about before we started recording, we're looking at changing our loo rolls from a bleached, virgin loo roll to an unbleached, recycled paper. Now that will get some people going, hang on why has the loo roll gone a funny brown colour? And it's not very nice. But it triggers thinking and to me that's the big bit. And as always I want to trigger people's thinking, I want to make them think differently. I want them to go, okay well if that's changed that makes me think about other things, you know, we've replaced all of the taps with push taps. It's the little things you can do that build engagement that trickle through and that builds a sort of collective desire to do more.\nJM: I think George has made some good points there about the obvious visible things that make people think. And this is about modelling. So if the organisation is modelling these things then there's a possibility for engagement and people asking the question, why have we done this, and maybe suggesting other things. But then there's also the possibility of spill over. So this is about values as well, so people may come to work and not share the values of the organisation but as they experience these things they may start to shift towards that.\nAnd then there's the possibility of spill over from work to home. So some of those behaviours, even if it's things like changing your loo roll, it might be things like travel options that James was talking about, so if my organisation is saying, we don't want you to travel to meetings anymore, we want you to do virtual meetings, and we're discouraging that, so we're making it harder for you to use your car, then people might think, well why are they doing that? And that will potentially spill over into their behaviour in their private lives as well and they'll start to question. Does every household needs to have a car, are there other options? And then you've got co-benefits that are associated with those things. So anyone who's looked into the issue of active travel and how to encourage that in organisations, one of the big drivers for that is the co-benefits for the health benefits for individuals as well as the reduced CO2 for the organisation and the individual.\nJR: We've found that more and more people want to get involved with these types of initiatives and they're not all driven centrally, often they spring up. In fact our global legal team across the group have been running a competition over the summer in terms of sustainable activity. So they created a range of activities you can do and you get points for each one. So for example eating vegetarian for a week, or eating vegan for a week. Interestingly the top scoring point was taking a three minute cold shower, I'm not sure how many people actually signed up for that one, but it was a great way of engaging the team and almost gamifying the whole topic so people were recognising that they can make a difference. And my experience is that people do want to make a difference, they do want to engage with this topic, they do want to work for organisations that are doing the right thing. And coming back to Jan's point at the beginning that's where HR is absolutely critical.\nJM: They also want the recognition for that. So your point there about the reward scheme, it might only be a tiny reward: an organisation I work with runs a lot of cycling initiatives and they have a monthly draw and you might win something like a Hi-Viz jacket. So the rewards don't have to be huge but for some people that is a real motivator. For other people rewards can be seen differently. But I think, coming back to the HR issue if HR is responsible for those things like paying benefits are we rewarding our top people by giving them a bigger, fatter car? And it's just thinking about that as a whole systems approach that you can't just do one thing like set organisational targets, we have to engage individuals and maybe them set their own targets as well.\nNC: And it maybe those individuals are at the most senior level.\nJM: Absolutely those are the best to role model because if the organisation's saying, we want to cut down our greenhouse gas emissions and yet our chief exec is driving to work in a gas-guzzling SUV, that's not sending the right message, so we need to have consistency and certainly that modelling, particularly from senior management will have huge ripple effects through the organisation. So if the boss is cycling to work that normalises that behaviour and makes it socially acceptable, so more people will probably sign up for that sort of thing.\nJR: EV100 come in where you can commit to transitioning your fleet to 100% electric vehicles which again is something we've done and we've actually now removed all pure petrol and pure diesels from our car scheme, so if you order a car today you have to order either a pure electric or a hybrid car, and the hybrids will be disappearing after a couple of years as well. So we're making that transition and as you say helping people along the journey towards more sustainable choices.\nJM: But it's also challenging do you actually need a car?\nNC: Okay well that's a massive question as well. George May I just want to ask you about being a B corporation, I was intrigued to see Coutts, the bank, has just become one of the largest UK bank brands to secure that kind of status, this is a company upholding standards in its dealing with staff, community, customers, the environment, that kind of thing, and I know that you have been through that process, I mean the Body Shop, Innocent Drinks, a lot of companies have done it, I just wondered what for you was the point, the value of that kind of accreditation?\nGM: Where we came at it from was initially we recognised that the B corporation standard is a robust and increasingly well-recognised standard, it's a very thorough review of a way that a business operates: so it looks at your environmental impacts, the impact on the community, workers, supply chain, governance, all of these things. So initially at the back end of 2019 we set out to work through the B impact assessment, which is about 200 questions, really as a benchmarking exercise, just to see how do we shape up against this criteria, where are the areas that we're not performing so well? So we set out really as a benchmarking gap analysis type exercise to identify areas for improvement.\nHaving gone through that we realised we then had sufficient points to proceed to the verification step and we certified in October 2020. And subsequently, as I mentioned, our sustainability improvement plan has been in part based on then running the gap analysis of, okay we've certified as B corp but there are obviously areas for improvement and what are they: they fall into obviously environmental categories but also workers, governance and others as well. So it's a commitment. We have had to change our corporate governing documents to be a B corp, so we've made a public statement that we believe business should be run for the benefit of all, not just for the shareholders, you're running it for all stakeholders and for the benefit of the environment. So you are taking a public stand in doing this. It is something that you are saying, we are going to run our business differently and for what we believe are better end purposes. I think there is obviously still the risk that some people see it purely as a potential marketing exercise. For us, like I say, it was very much built out of, going back to Jan's point at the very beginning, assessing where are we?\nNC: And indeed we've seen in the news that the Scottish brewer Brewdog is being challenged over some of its work culture practices and while we don't need to go into that here I mean just to illustrate the point that it's no good trying to burnish your environmental reputation if you fall short somewhere else in your people management Jan?\nJM: Yeah absolutely reputational risk is a huge issue, so you talked about green washing if organisations are held to account for their claims they have to be able to substantiate what they're doing and I think that's a really important aspect, particularly as reputation is what can attract people to work for an organisation. And Brewdog did have that good reputation which has been tarnished now, as your example. So reputational risk is something organisations take very seriously but also reputational enhancement through green credentials. And I think that's what George is talking about with the B corporation.\nNC: And indeed that's obviously one of the prizes here. We're almost coming to the end of our time, I just want to ask each of you, perhaps starting with James Robey, bringing this together just kind of give us a top tip from your own experience on really good ways of embedding sustainability in your organisation so you can see results?\nJR: So I think a couple of things, first of all, as we've mentioned before you've got to understand where your impacts are, you've got to understand where you make the biggest material impact on the environment. So first of all you need to quantify that and measure that. And then secondly I would encourage people to think through the business case for what you're trying to do, and there is a business case there. It may be a really obvious financial one that if you put in energy efficiency initiatives then you get direct payback in terms of savings to the bottom line. It may be a little bit less tangible, it may be in terms of your reputation, your ability to recruit the best people; it may be about getting the best customers or the best clients on board. So my suggestion, start with thinking about your material impacts and what you're trying to do, what you're trying to deliver and then think through, make sure you've got a strong business case for what you're doing and that will then help you follow though.\nNC: And George May other than doing something useful with your coffee grounds what was your tip?\nGM: I think James makes very good points around assessing what you're currently doing and how you're doing it and then the business case. I think beyond that my bet, especially in a small business where we're so interrelated and everyone deals with each other and crossover in terms of teams, that engagement piece is crucial, finding your champions. We don't have an HR function, we don't have a sustainability function, therefore those who pick up the driving, the sustainability elements of what we do forward, those who are running our sustainability improvement plan are volunteers if you like, and so it comes down to recruitment, getting the right people into the business, engaging them in the right way and I also think it's different for smaller businesses because we perhaps have less scrutiny but my view is don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I think you want to move forward, for the likes of James and other who are much more in the spotlight than we are, obviously there's more scrutiny for listed companies and so on, but don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you're moving forward, if you're taking proactive steps to improve what you do and how you do it I think that's the most important thing and ideally that you're measuring it and monitoring it.\nNC: And last word to Jan Maskell.\nJM: Absolutely agree with James and George about measurement being important because what gets measured becomes important. To add to what they've said I think taking a systems approach so that you're not just looking at one aspect you're looking right across the business of everything, and particularly thinking about things like policies and practices, so organisations will have policies, and should have an environmental sustainability policy but is that consistent with all the other policies and practices that are taking place? So that's where you get that systems approach that it's not just about the organisation or the individual it's about everything.\nNC: Excellent thank you very much indeed, our grateful thanks to all our guests: Jan Maskell there, James Robey and George May. And Jan's sustainability guide is on the CIPD website. Only last month we were discussing how people professionals can lead change and we were pleased to have that edition endorsed by the Association of Elite Human Resource Professionals, they pointed out that many negotiated their way through the pandemic by reflex, adjusting practices on the fly. It really is time, they say, for a different approach. We certainly agree with that.

      "full_text": "Duration: 0:30:37\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Still standing after the last 18 months so you know your organisation can cope with change but how will you manage the next wave? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWell whoever said that a change is as good as a rest well they'd clearly never been involved in a change programme because just as many are longing for a little post-lockdown predictability businesses face seismic shifts in customer demands, in global and trade markets and in digital technology and of course it's the people professionals who have to sell the human aspects of restructuring to an often resistant workforce, bedding in new strategies, policies and procedures, maybe all new technology or a much needed change of culture. Well with me to discuss how to best embrace and support organisational change Melanie Franklin, Founder and Principal of Agile Change Management who's sought after to inspire people to embrace and lead change having worked for a string of major public, private and not for profit organisations. Hello.\nMelanie Franklin: Hello.\nNC: And we're joined by CIPD board member Nick Williams, he's led digital and cultural change in government for Amazon, PWC, hello to you.\nNick Williams: Hello Nigel.\nNC: So Nick as I suggested at the start I mean COVID-19 has taught us that we can change, we can adapt pretty radically and quickly and I suppose organisations have got through the pandemic by sort of adjusting things as they've gone along, ever-changing government guidance to follow and all that, the sort of change that would have previously taken years.\nNW: The last 18 months has been unprecedented for most businesses with the pandemic, with the shift in working and hybrid working for employees, the increased usage of technology, the changes in processes, in policies, it's been tough and I think what we can all agree on is that this change is here to stay and continue over the next couple of years with the introduction of digital, AI, robotics, in the workplace as well as a shift involved in responsibilities. I think this is a great opportunity for the workforce but also HR professionals to really think about what change means and what change management and change leadership is actually all about and what capabilities are required there.\nNC: Well quite so. Melanie Franklin I know you're concerned with use how much people have been through and as a result of all these things which we've just heard about the situation is quite messy in some companies and of course people long to go back to the familiar, it kind of gives us peace doesn't it doing things how we used to do them and liked to do them.\nMF: I think first of all that people are utterly exhausted. I was giving this some consideration last night when I was thinking about my previous role many years ago as global head of crisis management and one of the things I learnt there, a bit like last March when we all fell into the hole that was COVID, is that you can quickly fall into the hole. So you make peace with what's happening, you deal with the emergency situation, you live on the adrenalin, but it's always so much harder to climb out of the hole, it takes so much longer and you slip and fall multiple times before you finally get to daylight again. And I think that is how it feels right now. I keep reading interviews with CEOs who are very proud that their organisations, as Nick was mentioning, have been able to change and change at pace, so they've brought along technology change at a much faster rate than they'd ever hoped, and they're very proud of that. And the theme though is, and we're going to continue to change at this pace, and everybody I know is going, please stop we need to catch our breath! So I think we're at an inflection point here about how clever we need to be about the changes that we pick and how they are managed if we aren't to cause a crisis.\nNW: And what a great point Melanie, you know, I really resonate with that and I think what's most important for organisations to think about is what do your people want, what are they looking for, what have they told you, are you listening to them? And I think good change management and the approaches that organisations have taken that organisations that have done really well in change have listened to the workforce. They've gone, okay well we're over the pandemic do you want to work at home permanently or do you want to work in the office, do you want to come back or do you not? What percentage of the workforce wants to do x, y, z well actually the answer is do what you like and there's lots of media press releases recently about organisations taking different approaches and as Melanie mentions I think CEOs are really excited about the changes that are happening, the next question is are those changes going to stick and I guess for CFOs and CEOs are you going to see the return on investment that you're making in the next year or so.\nNC: Okay so in a way you're kind of challenging the actual change process itself and its value?\nMF: Well I think for me there are two levels of change, there is the level at the senior executive level and then there is the change that is experienced by all those who are expected to work different and to adopt new ways of working. And I think if we are to take things forward there are two lessons, one at the executive level what I'm experiencing is the need for focus. There is so much change, there are so many opportunities for change it requires real personal discipline to be willing to take the decisions that say we're going to focus on these things and we're not going to get distracted by all of these other opportunities. But that requires a level of skill in decision making and prioritisation that I'm not seeing and that scares me. When you take a decision to say we're going to focus on x it means you've also accepted and made peace with the idea that you are going to let the opportunities of y and z go past you and I'm not seeing that willingness and so the alternative which those who have to work differently are suffering from is, oh we'll try everything, oh let's just give this a go and that scattergun approach is leading to exhaustion. On the flipside those who are experiencing change the things that they are looking for and need the most is practical guidance, they need change to be made as simple as possible, Nick just referred to the fact that let people decide. Yeah you've got to let people decide, there is something here and I'm sure we'll pick up in a moment about empowerment and autonomy but that has to be married with an ability, simple intuitive way of doing change to get on board with a new way of working.\nNC: But Nick isn't there a problem here because often the people managers, the HR people probably had no say in the overall shape of the change, they are having to implement stuff, they're having to be mindful of some of these things that you've talked about, about how people are feeling, how effective these changes are going to be if they don't win hearts and minds. So short of going back to senior managers and saying, look, stop, let's talk about this, HR can do very little can't they?\nNW: And that's where good change management is pivotal, it's about creating the leadership alignment. The top teams have to believe in what they're doing intrinsically, they can't get up in the morning and say, okay well strategically I need to make x amount of savings and so therefore I'm just going to do it because I think it's the right thing, because guess what, on the journey when they are trying to articulate that vision, that purpose to their teams and to senior managers they're not going to believe it and so why are people going to believe it. So I guess the step is all about ensuring that top team is aligned, they understand the purpose, the vision, they resonate with it, they're able to challenge and provide that diversity of thought, those thinking and ideas are taken into account, before then you go, okay well let's move forward. For the HR function let's remember HR's moving from more of an administrative function to more of a strategic function, leaders in the business are looking at HR, at HR business partners and HR directors to help them think about change management and implementation, but it's not just change management it's change leadership. They're looking for that objective opportunity to go, how do we make this happen? What tools do we need? But how do we message this clearly? How do we do this in a controlled way whilst we are looking at emerging change in an exponential way? So there are lots and lots of barriers here, but I think organisations can really think about what skills and capabilities they require in this area and then move forward.\nMF: I think for an HR person now to be successful I definitely agree we're moving much more into the strategic role. What that means I think in terms of change is being willing to challenge when there is that lack of focus and that lack of decision making around the direction of travel and what's expected of staff. HR have an important role to play in speaking up on behalf of everyone generally and saying a scattergun approach will really harm us, so what are the key things that you want us to focus on. Leaders don't get there naturally, it is incredibly hard because for every decision you take you are aware of what you're cutting out, what the opportunities you might be leaving behind. And in a world of so many opportunities there is so much more ambition than there are available resources, whether that's time or people or money, that you have to get into that decision making mode and I think senior HR leaders have a very important role to play in that initial challenge as well as being able to represent the voice on the rest of that journey about how staff are feeling and how we need to support them.\nNW: And what is it that helps HR leaders and change leaders in the organisation to make those decisions? I think it's data and it's data and insights and so you're  seeing a seismic shift of the HR function anyway, you're seeing more data led decision making around people, seeing more technology that's being brought in, that data can help you make those change decisions; that information and the metrics around how people are feeling; how many people are joining the organisation, how many people are leaving the organisation; why are they doing that; what's the adoption rate for the previous bit of change you just adopted; where have you got the most resistance in the organisation and therefore what are you going to do to tackle that resistance rather than just taking a holistic approach across the organisation and then blaming the fact that it costs a lot of money to implement change right? I think data and information and metrics are very, very important to create those insights.\nNC: Nick I'm glad you've mentioned resistance because I was going to ask both of you about that, first Melanie and then come back to you, are people, notwithstanding all we've heard about how tough it's been, are people inherently resistant to change?\nMF: Yes as human beings we are. We enjoy the fact that we know what we're doing. In change we call that unconscious competence and the two words are kind of important, number one the competence, the competence I know what I'm doing therefore competence is confidence, it can also be status in that I know what I'm doing, I feel good about myself, people come to me to ask me what I'm doing. So competence is confidence and status. It's reassuring, it feels very comfortable and unconscious competence means it's automatic, it's a habit, it's a well-travelled path. So I don't have to keep it in the forefront of my mind. I don't have to think about it. The problem with change is that what it does is it confronts any and all of us, whether the change is good or bad, with the same issue. It makes me consciously incompetent. Incompetent, wow this is new, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm going to have to work out how to make this work, and conscious, it's in the forefront of my mind, which means that change is mentally very draining, it's exhausting because we have to be focused on things. Those two factors mean that resistance to change is just as naturally saying, oh I've got too much on I don't want to do this. It's not that we're rejecting necessarily the quality of the change or whether the change is a good or bad idea, what we are rejecting is the exhausting journey to move from our current ways of working, even if we accept that they are not the best way of doing things, and that the nirvana that we're being promised is actually really beneficial, but the journey to get from one to the other is so exhausting on top of our existing workload that our resistance can often be quite passive because that resistance is, I'm going to disengage purely to save my sanity.\nNC: So do you agree with that Nick? When you're working with people on change programmes do you see typically resistance everywhere or is it sometimes a bit patchy?\nNW: So I do agree. And the question I would ask listeners is do you remember the last good day you had or the last bad day you had? And I always use that Nigel because you will remember all the change journeys that you have been on that have been terrible and therefore that experience featured as part of your resistance. So you will think about the organisational structural change that happened to you two or three years ago but no operating model change, no change in the ways of working, no recognition of the fact your role and responsibilities also changed, you had more workload, you needed to do things faster, you needed to use more technology. With the tech it's the same thing, a new system was introduced but you were never taught how to use it, there was no time given to you to learn about it, you weren't involved with the processes. So resistance I think comes inherently from the experiences that you've had but also the messaging, the involvement that you have in the process. And I think organisations have to let go and accept that they are going to have a group of people who resist change. It's then what tools, methodologies and purpose can you drive within the business and organisation to help people get over that resistance. And I think, you know, Melanie and I have spoken before, there are people who will never come off that resistance journey and you have to accept that because you're not always going to please everybody, you're looking to please the majority.\nNC: Okay so let's be practical about this then, let's talk about a difficult change programme somewhere, Melanie just talk us through, I mean perhaps you give them a kind of talk, touching on some of the things you've said, to get them to understand the process they're going to go through but how do you actually tackle making things happen?\nMF: I think there are two main themes and the biggest one is the one that is least likely to occur. So there are very few organisations that do change well because they fall at this first hurdle which is that there is genuine belief amongst all staff that the difficult decision's around prioritisation, and therefore that there is genuinely enough time for them to get involved in the change, have actually been taken. Too often we need to change direction, we need to implement this system, we need to do this, is put on top of the existing responsibilities. Now I've been doing an informal survey for over ten years, everybody I talk to, the people that come my way are involved in change, they're trying to lead their own small teams through change, they might be leading a department or an entire country office and they're pretty much doing about 130% of their contract hours already, they're already giving a third extra, whether that's the people that start work on a Sunday night because they start to plan their work for the week ahead; some people set aside an hour on a Saturday morning to try to get a grip of what happened in the previous week. People stay late, they come in early, we don't have proper lunch breaks. So generally people are already over-committed and that hurdle of well let's just throw another thing on top and see if they can cope, there's a lack of believability in the change because whatever the benefits are it's outweighed by that, yeah it sounds great but no seriously we don't have the time, we've got so much else on. So there is a very simple thing to be done, and I've seen it done in very few of my clients over the years which is up front they sit around and say, not what the change is going to be but how can we streamline, how can we take away things right now that will bring back some time? Let's cancel some of these meetings, let's stop asking for these reports, let's stop getting people to create these presentations. We could look in the systems ourselves for that data. I've seen this happen, I saw it happen as a domino effect in one board where one person spoke up and said what they were going to get rid of, and it was the CEO, and then he looked at the next person along and she came up with what she was going to get rid of and it went like a domino effect and funnily enough they made the quickest progress in transforming their organisation. So there is something very practical that can be done and it goes to the heart of believability from staff, it goes to the heart of the ability of staff to genuinely take part, to take ownership, otherwise how can they?\nNW: I'll take on two main points. The first one is around benefits. I think often organisations get stuck with change management or promoting the use of change management when it comes to benefit realisation. Often on programme management agendas, on portfolio management agendas at the board it's almost what's the return on investment from a cash perspective that I'm going to get here? So the quantifiables. But change is quantifiable as well as qualitative. There's the narrative piece around employee experience and employees being genuinely satisfied, energised, positive about working in that organisation because either their technology is state of the art and they're able to work mobile and work from home without having any difficulties and I've got the best organisation because I can look at my payslip, sign off, sign on, whenever I need to. You've got the benefits around people's usage of time savings I think you can think about. I think organisations really have to be innovative when they think about change and benefits so if there was a role and responsibility shift for example how much time are we saving by changing that role and responsibility. How many people are currently doing that role and what's the benchmark salary of those people, therefore do the maths and that's your saving, if you want to talk numbers. I think there is a way to talk numbers, I think as qualified change practitioners we really understand how to carve out those numbers and showcase something in an investment or business case to really show the value. And I think organisations often get stuck at the, I don't want to invest at the outset in change because it's going to cost me x and it's increasing the price of my programme and I don't have that investment and I can't see the numbers at the back end. You can all see the numbers at the back end and guess what you probably won't need to do your technology, your operating model changes twice or three times because you'll get it right first time. So benefits is really important, I think it's a sticky conversation that most change programme managers and board members have. The second thing is change management isn't necessarily a capability that is only run within bespoke programmes. In HR we run diversity and inclusion programmes, culture change programmes, programmes for bring in new wellbeing systems and processes to look after staff. I think change managers are real subject matter experts in this place and therefore the value should be promoted across every part of the organisation to bring them in. HR can move into finance to help them with their purchase to pay solutions and their ERP solutions, they can move into commercial elements, they can move into sales, change managers can move around an organisation and I think that's the benefit of having them. And I think what I've been talking about is how to articulate that and how to showcase that benefit across the business.\nNC: This is quite a sophisticated approach to managing change, a lot of people are still stuck, as I think one of you said to me before, on spreadsheets and on PowerPoint or something, the art of change management has moved on, which of course brings us to the question Melanie is it something best left to specialists, if you're not specifically trained should you either get training or bring in an outsider to manage all this? Is an outsider actually somebody who can tackle some of these entrenched issues more easily because they are independent, they don't have a history with the company?\nMF: I think the first thing is that with the volume of change, just looking at it from a common sense point of view, no organisation can solely rely on externals, it would never get through all of the change that it actually wants to happen. And increasingly I am seeing, and this is over the last four or five years, so this pre-dates COVID but a recognition by organisations that actually building an internal capability for managing change is incredibly important. Now what that means is they have invested in bringing on people like me but who actually work for their organisation and are heading up some kind of centralised change team. But that doesn't negate the fact that actually, as we've already said about HR professionals but in fact across all leadership roles, understanding what on earth behavioural change actually is, what are the steps to manage and implement behavioural change is an incredibly important skillset. I keep saying to people it really is the defining leadership skillset of the 21st century. Now I'm old enough to remember when we were always taught that you couldn't go into the boardroom unless you had really good financial skills. Then about probably 15 years ago the message changed that you couldn't go into the boardroom unless you had excellent IT skills. And now we're getting that message that actually unless you've got experience and ability in transformation you really can't get into the boardroom. So I think there is something, anecdotal evidence aside, there is something there around how important transformation as a skillset is. That isn't to say that externals aren't incredibly important but they have to be used cleverly and they are not an excuse for not building the skill within your organisation. So if you don't know the basics of how humans react to change and how actually we can lead ourselves through a journey from that conscious incompetence I talked about to getting back to unconscious competence then get informed. There are plenty of ways to do that but it is a skillset that is incredibly important and very simply it's because we all know we're living in a world where there are so many different opportunities for change, internally you can choose certain changes but also an organisation that maybe doesn't want to change that much still doesn't get a choice because all of their partner organisations, their regulators, their markets, their competitors, their industry and their customers, are all changing at pace. And so there's an awful lot of change taking, not change originating happening. So you've got no choice, you can't say, oh we don't feel like making change happen. No we've all got to change. We keep changing all of the time. If you don't have that capability internally how on earth are you going to cope?\nNC: And Nick Williams you've been on this journey yourself and specialise in change now, what other advice would you give people who want to become much better at helping their organisations to get through these kind of things?\nNW: I think often consultants and external providers are seen as snake oil charm salesmen but actually I think most consultants, most external perspective we bring is to work with the organisations that we think are needing support and want to move forward. So I tend to work a lot with the public sector and rail and infrastructure and the working in house yes you absolutely need capability, you need people to understand what change is. The struggles in house is that often you can't get through the politics of a board because guess what you're part of that organisation so your chief finance officer, your chief HR officer, your chief executive officer says, you know what I don't fancy doing this so we're not doing it, how confident are you as a change manager, programme manager, to challenge it? And that's I think the key thing. What the external perspective brings, and often through consultants or external FTCs what they bring is that level of challenge because actually you know what that global benchmarking across other organisations, what's the market currently doing in that particular space? What are the best approaches and the most innovative approaches that have been created and implemented? And guess what change changes every day, there are so many new ways of leading and driving change. And the most innovative one I've seen recently is EY's change experience model which is technology led. It's built through the Harvard Business School and it uses data and insights to find pockets of resistance to then send out different tools and techniques to get those people back on the journey and measures it iteratively. There is so much out there.\nNC: I mean that sounds quite expensive but I love the idea of actually winkling out where the resistance is, that might suggest that there might be problems with the change programme itself Melanie Franklin, maybe you don't need Harvard to fix that?\nMF: I think it always comes back to this basic point, can you very quickly ask any member of staff do you know what we're trying to do around here?\nNC: Okay that's good.\nMF: You don't need to go too much further than that I don't think.\nNC: That's excellent advice, a couple more tips from you on more effective change in your organisation?\nMF: I think one of the key tips I'd say from an HR perspective is this, tackle one of the other big blockers. We are asking people to get involved in change, we're asking people to also do their day job, have you genuinely reflected that in their job description because if it's not in their job description then they won't have key performance indicators attached to it and as we all know what we measure is genuinely what people when push comes to shove put their efforts behind. And so if you are asking a staff member, maybe they're a middle manager who 70% of the job is getting the day job done and servicing customers and looking after staff but another 30% is how they reinvent their own job, how they reinvent the work of their staff, how they integrate new systems and new ways of working from other parts of the organisation. If that 30% of their effort isn't recognised as a key part of their role and if they are not evaluated on it where is the incentive for them not only to do it but also to do it well and to get better at doing it? I keep tripping over this issue that when I pick out the job descriptions of people I don't see that there is a combination of run the business, change the business sitting there together then we fall at that hurdle when the going gets tough.\nNC: And Nick Williams data can help with all that, you've already banged the drum for data any other final thoughts from you?\nNW: So organisations remember change is exponential and change is non-stop and it's not going anywhere. So change is going to be on the continuous cycle for organisations and I think in the market we can probably all agree that we are seeing more transformation and more change roles out there. So there is a need. So I think that's number one. I think look for small wins and quick wins, breakdown the change into steps rather than jumping into something and then losing control, and that's where qualified change practitioners and leaders can really support in helping you carve out that journey. And finally understand your people and engage with them regularly. I think the people are very, very important, the workforce will tell you how they feel and if organisations are doing that consistently you're on a better road to adopting those benefits that you're looking for.\nNC: Well brilliant advice from both of you, thank you very much to our great duo Melanie Franklin and Nick Williams. I certainly agree with that remark about change being inevitable. I read somewhere change is inevitable except from the office vending machine. And as we finish I'm a bit allergic to inspirational quotes but I did like this one, Change is hard at the start, messy in the middle, but best at the end.

      "summary": "In the face of the global pandemic, learning professionals have had to adjust swiftly to sweeping changes to how people work and connect and critically rethink learning delivery. However, a high level of uncertainty remains about what the future holds, with just 18% of organisations expecting learning strategy, investment, and resourcing to return to pre-pandemic levels.\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, David Hayden, Digital Learning Portfolio Manager at the CIPD and Stella Collins, Co-Founder and Chief Learning officer at Stellar Labs, as we explore how learning practice adapted to overcome pandemic-induced challenges and to seize the opportunity for rethinking learning, to better fulfil the requirements of changing organisations.",

She has a clear understanding of the challenges faced by organisations in upskilling and reskilling their people, especially with digital change being so high on the agenda.\nStella and her team pragmatically apply principles from neuroscience and psychology to consult, design and build practical performance focused solutions with measurable ROI. She has trained thousands of learning professionals in brain-friendly principles over more than 20 years in L&D.\nDuration: 00:27:02\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: With the world of work turned upside down how can we make sure that on the job learning meets the needs of the business and its people? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nSo classroom and most face-to-face learning had to go out of the window and necessity has been the mother of invention in L&D; digital tools have been deployed piping training to wherever our people are. But what do we do next other than mutter something about hybrid learning. Well for this podcast we thought we'd ask two experienced learning specialists to share what they have learned on how to reimagine, reinvent and deliver what your organisation needs now.\nWith us firstly a learning scientist, though as she likes to say not in a white coat and safety goggles kind of way, she's all about applying science-based learning to business performance, the co-founder of Stellar Labs, Stella Collins, hello.\nStella Collins: Hello.\nNC: And from the home team David Hayden, the CIPD's Digital Learning Portfolio Manager who's been a contributor to published research on all this. Hello David.\nDavid Hayden: Hello.\nNC: Well let's start with where we are with David, thanks to the pandemic. I wonder if you could just summarise for us quickly how L&D practice has had to pivot? How is it typically managing to deliver?\nDH: A number of organisations have reacted in a very similar way, so they were able to take a pause, able to look at what digital options were open to them, a number of organisations tried to lift and shift their traditional face-to-face offering and put that into a series of virtual classrooms. However very quickly people realised that you couldn't actually do that, move a five day course into the equivalent number of virtual learning classrooms, something had to give. So over the course of the year we saw a lot of people really adapt and reframe how they put their learning content out there. And I think it's also important to mention as well not every single organisation followed the same path and in some organisations they still had an element of face-to-face for their organisation.\nNC: Because of course people are working face-to-face with the public or doing crucial work with technology or something so it's such a mixed picture isn't it?\nDH: Absolutely is, absolutely is.\nNC: So Stella let's turn to you what is your sense of how we're managing?\nSC: I think people have managed incredibly well mostly. I think at the start there was a lot of panic and everything on LinkedIn and Twitter was all about how do I do virtual learning? I think people have adapted incredibly well. Some people are now doing really great virtual learning but I think they were the ones who were well-equipped beforehand, they'd already been experimenting or using it regularly. I think there's still quite a lot of people who are struggling with the online platforms, struggling to kind of make things really engaging for people, so there's a lot of content delivery which isn't learning, it's just content. So I think there's a real, like David said really, there's a real mix and a blend and like you say David there are some organisations, one of our clients they're a factory, they're a manufacturing organisation, they still do face-to-face learning because they're still working on the factory floor. But we've got other clients who everything's gone digital now and one of our programmes we're going to run is a leadership programme and we're going to deliver that digitally which I think most people haven't done before so it's going to be really interesting to see how that actually pans out in reality when it's implemented.\nNC: Yes I mean slightly ironic in a way because one of the things that's important to leadership is forging those relationships with every individual in your team and of course that's very difficult. David you did this big Learning and Skills at Work report with Accenture, can we drill down a bit more into some of your findings in that?\nDH: Absolutely. So we had over 1,000 respondents and one of the things we noticed that in a third of the organisations they had budgets or resources cut which was another added layer of challenge on top of the fact that there was a pandemic. We also noticed the number of organisations where learning and development staff were furloughed which again proves another layer of complexity, how do you adapt to your organisation changes when you've got less people? So we saw a number of organisations through that. And we saw, as you would expect, that dramatic towards the use of learning technologies. However the bulk of that tended to be the use of virtual classrooms as opposed to some of the broader examples of digital technology you have there.\nNC: Yes because a lot of this digital learning has been around, hasn't it David, the platforms have been there, in some cases organisations have been reluctant to use them. It's like what a lot of people have said about COVID in other ways, it's kind of brought ten years of revolution in ten months?\nDH: Absolutely. So some of the wider resources that are out there, so short videos, podcasts, interactive PDFs, are all things that are starting to grab the excitement and creativity and innovation of learning and development teams and they are starting to be used but yeah the main bulk was, we did see in the research, take up of virtual classrooms.\nNC: Now Stella I'm beginning to blanch when I hear about PDFs and webinars and all that, how good are we at monitoring how effective this training is, particularly where it's moved to a digital platform?\nSC: I don't think we're anywhere near as good as we can be, and as good as we could be, and I think that's one of the things we really need to start doing is really measuring what works. We know that some things about digital are really valuable, I think it's much more democratising, everybody can have a voice in digital, if it's a good digital platform. But also there are some challenges around attention, around people feeling really tired with a lot of online stuff. It does use your brain in a different way to genuine face-to-face connection and our brains have not evolved as quickly as COVID has evolved. So I think there's big changes coming but I think what we need to start doing is measuring really what does work and by measuring what does work then we can actually create the best blend that is going to work. That's some research we're doing at the moment with the University of Antwerp is looking at what's a really good blend and what is it that can support a learning journey for learners both from their own side but also what can managers and mentors and peers do to support them and use that data to support the learning journey and find out what is effective, what is turning things into real world application.\nNC: Okay well we'll delve a little more deeply into how we can start doing that in a minute but before we do that let me go back to David Hayden and again perhaps from the work you've done on the Learning and Skills at Work survey and other CIPD work, what would you say about how you begin to assess the effectiveness of what you're delivering?\nDH: If you're in an organisation with a catalogue of learning programmes you can go on you've got to ask yourselves when were those programmes designed? So if those programmes were designed five years ago and learning and development teams are offering those programmes maybe month in/month out or three or four times a year those programmes were designed in a time when an organisation was very, very different. So if you've got a product manual of training courses then I suggest that's not quite in line with where the business is today or where it needs to be tomorrow. So really do we understand what our people skills are? How that marries up with the people skills needed for today and tomorrow, and then start shortening that gap. Really how does any learning offering align with the organisation's key performance indicators? So everything that learning and development does there will be someone in that organisation responsible for a key performance indicator around that. So we've got to get closer to those people and really make sure we are sharing the same messages they are. That's where we've got to start.\nSC: Totally agree with David there, however we've just been working with a really interesting company who recognise that key performance indicators are important but they're also actually talking about things that aren't key performance indicators, what can they measure in terms of people relationships, in terms of just their relationships with their customers. And they've been really interesting about saying we don't only want to measure KPIs we want to see, hear and feel different behaviours which are slightly harder to measure but they're really focused on that and I'm really curious to see how are they going to measure it? That's part of the question we're doing at the moment, and what's going to be the long-term impact of that, rather than just the standard key performance indicators.\nNC: So if I've got this right Stella what you're saying is that the evidence, the data, that you're gathering, really has to go right to the heart of what the training is for and it starts with the management's requirements and it's only later that you actually devise the detail?\nSC: I don't think it necessarily starts with management requirement, it might actually start with people on the shop floor or wherever it is we're working. I really think we need a learning revolution, I don't think learning should come from above, I think learning should come from everywhere in the organisation. It needs to come top down, bottom up, and from the sides.\nNC: Well what you say is very convincing but there might be organisations who haven't quite cottoned on to that, so how do you get that message over to management that in the longer term, in terms of happy, contented, productive staff that stay a decent length of time they need to adapt and understand that?\nSC: I think that comes to really looking at the learning culture in the organisation and what's the culture in the organisation, it's beyond the learning culture, are you allowing your people to show initiative, to be innovative, to come up with good ideas and take those ideas forward, or are you a very hierarchical, top down, organisation that doesn't? And I think the more we can support everybody in the organisation and say, look I really need to learn this because I'm the one who's doing this job, I know what I need to learn, and rather than then taking months and months and months for L&D to come up with something maybe they can find ways for themselves to actually do that learning. And I think for that the key skill we really, really need is the skill of learning to learn, because so many of us don't actually know how we learn. There's lots of myths and all kinds of fairy stories out there about learning and I think if we could teach people the skill of learning that would actually help us upskill on all the other skills, it's like the foundation skill.\nDH: And to build on that, so not only learning about learning, which is fundamental to the job we are doing but also learning more about the tools we have got at our disposal. So for instance if someone says, yeah I evaluate our products using Kirkpatrick, for instance and there are other models available, but Kirkpatrick tends to be a popular one, do we really understand what Kirkpatrick said in the 1950s, where it came from, ((Catsell?)) in 1948? And then how have the Kirkpatrick Foundation evolved over the past 50/70 years and what are they saying now? Because giving a happy sheet out or a quiz at the end of an online session isn't measuring in terms of what the organisation needs or what we need as professionals to say, actually I am making a difference with my learning and development provision in this organisation. So we need to learn about learning absolutely as Stella says but learn really what the author's said about the tools we think we are using.\nSC: I just think it's really important, you know, that Kirkpatrick yes it's a useful model but there's many more models that are much more focused on the doing. How can we tell that people can take action in the workplace, so Will Thalheimer's model for instance really looks at, you know, can people make decisions at work as opposed to have they learned whatever it was they were supposed to learn, but can they use that learning? And I think there are better models now available I think, Brinkerhoff is another one, which is focused on the doing. And that's what learning's about, learning's about something to do.\nNC: David budgets are being cut you mentioned earlier that people are having to effectively do more with less, and the crisis is forcing learning and development to prioritise isn't it and in some ways that's a good thing isn't it?\nDH: Yes, so it can very much be. So one of the things I noticed prior to the pandemic is those organisations that saw their budget cut year-on-year were actually doing more innovative things with less money and the less resource that they had.  And it gives us an opportunity to actually be more creative. Some of the things we saw before the pandemic, those organisations that had very, very healthy and growing budgets were less likely to adapt some of their traditional systems. So it can be viewed as a positive thing.\nNC: So Stella when you're called in to help a company improve the performance of their learning tell us the kind of problems that you work on people. Is it about fully understanding and using these complex tools that we mentioned earlier or people's problems with learning and development more fundamental?\nSC: That's a big question! I think it's about first understanding where the organisation is and where they want to go and where their people are and where they want to go, so really understanding that kind of culture organisationally and the learning culture, because everybody has a learning culture, sometimes it's a great one and sometimes it's an ineffective one but everybody has one. And from there you need to start understanding what is it the people want, what is it they need to be able to do? Who's involved in the learning process because if you're learning something you can get so much support from your managers but I think peer learning, peer-to-peer learning is something that's been somewhat neglected and I think that is one of those innovative ones that you were talking about David that organisations who haven't got money are using peer-to-peer learning and that's how we always learned from the start.\nNC: Stella how do you do that when people are primarily online or working remotely or say they come into the office but not on the same day, so how do you get that peer learning going?\nSC: So yeah a little bit harder when it's not face-to-face but there's no reason why we can't have...so one of things we do in our organisation we have something called 'brain time', once a month one of us, and everybody in the organisation has to take a turn, one of us shares something with the rest of the team, teaches something else in the rest of the team. Sometimes it's something really practical, sometimes it's something a little bit more philosophical or principled-based. So that's one thing you can do. But you can also make sure you're using the tools that are there, use Teams or whatever, Slack, whatever it is you're using in your organisation, create the Wiki, create that user-generated content that is usually what people find useful themselves and if they can share that with their colleagues it becomes useful across the organisation. So again it's about not having learning come from the top but actually having learning spreading throughout the organisation and enabling people to feel confident and share that learning, share what it is they're doing and how they do it.\nNC: Well let's talk better future delivery and of course invariably, as we've been hearing that means tech. I wonder what we can learn from the use of digital tools and e-learning platforms, you've mentioned one or two of them, since the pandemic. I was struck, David, by a finding in your latest Learning Skills at Work report that the shift hasn't necessarily been to the more advanced tools with the most potential?\nDH: For the second year running the report highlighted that tools such as virtual reality, augmented reality, are nowhere near as popular as tools such as virtual classrooms for instance. And there is a huge set-up cost for those kind of tools. Again it's really important not to go out and buy the tool just for the sake of buying the tool but make sure there's a recognised business need for that. I've seen things like virtual reality and augmented reality work really, really well in places like fast food restaurants, in places like the mining industry, and where there's complex production, so where you're stopping the system that's really, really expensive but you can use that kind of technology to really home in and develop people's skills so you're not stopping the real world work, you're actually using those technologies for the benefit but the numbers are relatively small overall.\nSC: And I think part of that is because they're a) very expensive and b) they do have to be really, really well designed otherwise they become less than useless. So I think the challenge for organisations with smaller budgets they just can't afford to do the R and AR, but we're for instance playing with a tool at the moment called Gather.town, which it's an online platform but it allows you to feel a bit embodied again because in Gather.town you've got like a little avatar that can move around and you can go into different rooms, you can take people into breakout rooms, literally, and you can have four breakout rooms and you actually, you're not physically moving, the visual imagery of your avatar moving actually gives you a connection that is very different to most of our virtual classroom-based stuff which means you're sitting there for a few hours, I mean I always try and include in virtual classrooms some element of people getting up to stand up to do something if they can, but I think that technology, we're not exploring all the options, we're kind of going down the, well VR can do it really well and it can but it's expensive, but there are lots of other really useful tools out there that we could be starting to embrace.\nNC: So David we're trying bringing this together, how do you start doing that? What's the process of actually upgrading what you do?\nDH: So it comes back to that point you challenged me on earlier, being really, really clear about what it is the organisation needs and L&D's role within that. Then being really, really clear about what the learners need. So it's no good going off and buying something that isn't a good fit with your organisation and with your learners. And really thinking around what's the trajectory for that piece of kit because you don't want to be ending up buying something that's going to end up like MySpace or Bebo or something like that, what's going to go out of favour or out of updates in a few years. So really kind of make sure whatever it is you're looking for really ties in with the organisation need and the learning need and can be accessible to people at a time they need it.\nNC: And of course there will be organisations where they won't be able to afford that. There was this somewhat worrisome finding that only 18% of organisations surveyed think that their investment and resourcing will go back to what it was before the pandemic, so I wondered Stella in the face of that what would be on your check list for learning and development managers to kind of get the most bangs for your buck?\nSC: I think use the tools that are already there, that you've already got, you know, if you go digging around in your system you've probably got all sorts of tools you probably haven't been harnessing or using as well as you could; investigate the tools that are free to use or very cheap to use, and there's plenty of them; and I would say be really curious, talk to other people, what are they doing, maybe there's ways you can collaborate to use tools together. So really think more broadly rather than just the big LMS tools that are sold to us at learning tech for instance, there's all sorts of other things. You can create chat bots quite easily, you can create apps that support learning quite easily without them being very expensive. So I think it's looking at what are the smaller things you can do. Even mobile phone technology, messaging, there's some people who actually create whole courses through messaging, which are very good if there's very little money around.\nNC: It's very reassuring you've actually started going through some of the key findings in the Learning and Skills report, and the first one you've covered there, embracing digital innovation and of course David you can start small can't you and experiment before scaling up?\nDH: Absolutely and if you look at any piece of advice around this that is exactly the one key consistent piece of advice, start small. And also what I would say is don't be afraid of harnessing the skills and knowledge of the people that you've got within your organisation because there's bound to be people who in their own time, invest lots of time, effort and energy in keeping themselves digitally up to date.\nNC: There was something else in your findings here which, I'm going to ask Stella about it, talks about agreeing the role of line managers in the L&D context, is that not clear what the line managers are supposed to do?\nSC: I think that's one of the biggest challenges. I've been in L&D for 20-odd years and every single year somebody says, but it's line managers they're the ones. And I feel really sorry for line managers, they're really squashed, they've got loads and loads of different things to do and they don't know that much about learning so they don't necessarily know how to support a learner. One of the things I think is really valuable and we in L&D can do is support line managers. So for instance somebody goes on a course or they do a piece of digital learning and we give the line manager some questions to ask them, you know, what would be really good feedback questions to ask this person after they've been on this course? And make it easy for line managers because at the moment we just say, yes, yes after a course you have to give them feedback, or you have to ask them questions. And they're like, I haven't got time and I don't know what to do. Give people checklists, make it really, really easy for them, and support the line manager in supporting the learning, or use the system to do it is the other way to do that as well.\nDH: And also with that in terms of the time we do spend in learning and development with line managers to what degree are we developing them to be great people developers themselves? We tend to have line managers together and we tend to throw things at them that they may never, ever use and generic in virtually every single line manager or leadership course, let's actually take some time to say, look part of your role as line manager is to be a great people developer and here's some tips how to do it.\nNC: Fantastic. Well you've been through many of the findings there, certainly the last one you've already alluded to, be evidence-based, define your desired outcomes, engage key stakeholders, gather evidence and measure the learning impact.\nSC: Can people do the job they need to do? But again that can be measured because it might be measured by, you know, the number of customers they serve, the number of customers who say they're happy, it could be any number of things but it's about measuring what people do, not what they thought about the training, not what they thought about the lunch, but what are they actually doing when they get back to work. And you can't measure that immediately they get back after a training programme or a learning event, it's got to be once they've had time to implement what they're learning and to practice it and get feedback and really embed it as part of their normal behaviour.\nNC: Brilliant. Worth just saying here if you have enjoyed this podcast make sure you check out our previous one, still very much current, we've alluded to some of these issues about post-pandemic digital fatigue, how to set healthy boundaries on home working. I did just want to run past you what I was seeing from the CEO of WeWork, Sandeep Mathrani, who suggested there is an easy way for companies to spot their most engaged employees, he says, they're the ones who want to come back to the office at least two thirds of the time. And I know Apple among many other companies have had a big row internally about this, but Sandeep Mathrani says, those who are least engaged are those who are most comfortable working from home. Is he right David? It's a controversial thing to say.\nDH: The things that come to mind as I hear that are things like presenteeism, things like some resistance to change, listening to employees and kind of really understanding how to implement a hybrid working system. Yeah, kind of lots of things I'm afraid I can't agree to what Sandeep has said there at all.\nSC: And I think for me it comes down to trust doesn't it? If you've got people who are, you know, they enjoy their job, they're trusted to do their job, I don't think it comes down to whether you want to go back into the office. Maybe they've got many, many other commitments and actually they can work much better from home because they haven't got to spend two or four hours commuting a day.\nNC: So does it say more about him? Is it really a sign you're a snowflake if you're a bit nervous of going back to the office?\nSC: No absolutely. And I think everyone is a bit nervous because it's a big change, we've got used to working like this and I think we have to accept that people will feel, you know, we've been bombarded with information about how dangerous it is in the office, how dangerous it is outside, I think people will feel nervous because it's another change and change always comes with a feeling of anxiety.\nNC: Well it's been great having you both so a big thank you to our dynamic duo, Stella Collins and David Hayden.

      "summary": "Is the human brain wired for a digital working? Virtual platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams are instrumental in bridging the communications gap between homeworkers, but how can we set healthy boundaries for digital tools, so they don’t fuel harmful working practices? With the expected rise in hybrid working and the impending return to the workplace, healthy, sustainable implementation is key, and identifying stress factors will help keep digital fatigue at bay.\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, Jonny Gifford, Senior Advisor for Organisational Behaviour at CIPD, Nilufar Ahmed, Lecturer in Social Sciences at the University of Bristol, and Marc Weedon, Sr. Director of Human Resources at Zuora, as we explore the pitfalls of working in a digital context, and how to foster a healthy relationship with communication tools for future work.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:29:53\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Let's face it working alone all day on screen isn't normal, so here's how to recognise and combat the threat to our wellbeing that comes with tech that's hard to switch off.\nYes, digital fatigue is a thing. I found 133 million results on Google, take new research by the London Southbank University which suggests that digital fatigue is a threat to employee wellbeing. A recent CIPD update poll found eight in ten workers had experienced Zoom fatigue: it's a recognised state of physical and mental exhaustion, cut off from colleagues our workdays driven by stacks of onscreen devices and life-sapping Zoom meetings.\nWith us this month are psychologist and psychotherapist who lectures in social sciences at Bristol Uni, Dr Nilu Ahmed, she has a deep interest in how the pandemic has changed the workplace. Hello.\nNilufar Ahmed: Hello there.\nNC: Marc Weedon is senior HR director at Zuora, an enterprise software provider which specialises in subscription-based products, hello.\nMarc Weedon: Hello.\nNC: And from the home team the CIPD's senior adviser for organisational behaviour whose research is steeped in the elements of what makes job quality and the use of social technology it's Jonny Gifford, hello.\nJonny Gifford: Hi.\nNC: So Jonny before we get into the detail of what triggers this digital fatigue and how to combat it let's look at the big picture. I mean we're all doing more remote working, less commuting, more flexibility, I mean we're all wearing comfier clothes for this meeting so I wonder why maybe we're sometimes less than comfortable?\nJG: Well we should mention that perhaps through the pandemic some people have seen improvements in their work/life balance, so there's a bit of a tale of two cities going on here, especially for managers and professionals, but in terms of why remote and digital working might worsen employee wellbeing I think there are some fundamentals that we'd do well to start with.\nOne is the nature of working from home is partly changed. So where it used to be seen more as a benefit or even a privilege through the pandemic it's been a necessity and it doesn't suit everyone. So you might not have a suitable physical work environment, you might have serious distractions from people that you work with, it might not suit the nature of your work.\nA second challenge is that when we feel pressure to be always on, which is really about organisational climate and is something that can exist anyway but it can intensify with mobile or remote technology because there's that potential for work to always be there.\nAnd then a third aspect is that there's a concerning general trend to a loss of employee autonomy or control over one's work and some employees also see greater work intensity. And again that's not something that's unique to working digitally but changes in technology can play a role.\nNC: So Dr Nilu Ahmed is this something which is reflected in your work, your research, in the things that people tell you?\nNA: It really people are talking about working longer hours and as Jonny said there is a sense of at the start of the pandemic when we went into lockdown there's almost a novelty element of that, that oh god we're all working from home, all of that ability to not have a commute going into work, the extra time we had, enjoying the company of people around us, and suddenly all of the things that were really lovely at the start of the lockdown are perhaps the things that are starting to grate on us ever so much right now when we've got family members who are also competing for just things like the internet bandwidth and when people can be online at the same time as each other but also working spaces, some people will be in bedrooms, some people will be in dining rooms, if you're lucky you'll have spaces that you can share out and work separately from but not everyone is as privileged as that.\nNC: And when we were talking before you used this phrase cognitive overload. What did you mean by that?\nNA: It means that we're constantly assaulted by things. When we're looking at Zoom we're getting so much information our brains process lots and lots of information at the same time but we filter through for the most important things but that doesn't mean our brain isn't always processing what's going on in the background when we're having these conversations. And so we're constantly picking up new things: every time you join a new Zoom meeting there's a bit of background that we're looking at, whether we're paying conscious attention or not subconsciously our brains are thinking, oh look at that picture, oh look at that lighting there. And that's all having to be dealt with while we're still trying to do our daily job and focus on the task at hand.\nNC: Marc Weedon a lot of the focus has been on meetings hasn't it and I've see research well from Stamford talking about how just having your own picture in frame doesn't help and there's lots of other stuff, some of which we've already touched on here to do with reading, body language and interpreting silences and everything, have you found meetings have been a particular issue with your people, I mean what do you think the stress points are that lead to perhaps this digital fatigue?\nMW: Yeah meetings are an issue and particularly in an environment like my organisation where we have employees scattered over the world and there's a lot of remote management to do there's no doubt that calls over video are more tiring than face to face ones so there's always the pressure of having to deal with glitchy tech, the video buffering, cutting out all together and is my bandwidth going to last, just trying to read the non-verbal cues which are more straightforward perhaps when you're in a face to face environment in a meeting room with the same people.\nNC: I mean this is something you would never tolerate if the meeting was in the same room.\nMW: No exactly, so there's just additional layers of stress and I find personally looking at my own image on a Zoom call for example that's stressful as well. So even having to stare at your own face as well as those of others. And then there's obviously the distraction element, so are the kids going to run in at any one stage, or in my case are the two cats going to come and nag me for my food? So just anticipating things which wouldn't happen in the regular day to day environment before COVID. So I agree yeah.\nNC: Just more broadly Marc from the conversations you have with your people scattered around the world what other particular things do they say are more stressful since you've had to change the way you've worked out of offices into private homes?\nMW: So one of them has been mentioned already and there's this lack of, or guarding against, the more defined start and end points. Ordinarily if you're going to an office there's a commute zone, for example, and that almost represents a start to the day and an end to the day. So what we've been combating with and we've been doing this recently called the work/life manifesto. There's a series of tips which we've done in terms of how you manage your time. So making sure that you're not always on, that there is a defined start, that there is a defined end and during the working day it's making sure that you avoid that Zoom fatigue or the digital fatigue by making sure that, for example, if you have got back to back Zoom calls then you arrange them for 25 minutes or for 55 minutes, depending whether they're meant to be half an hour or an hour long, just so that there is these micro breaks between these ongoing calls.\nNC: Okay well we'll look in a bit more detail at some of the things which maybe organisations ought to be doing to sort of mitigate some of these symptoms, but let's look in a bit more detail about the actual indications that things are wrong for people. So Dr Nilu Ahmed I mean this can start can't it just with physical things, I mean just sore eyes or headaches, something like that?\nNA: Mm, very often, and many of us don't have appropriate work chairs to be sitting on, people have worked sitting on their dining chairs for seven/eight, hours a day because they're just fixed to their screen. And we're looking at screens, they're in such a short range and that's really stressful on our eyes, that's a lot of eyestrain but it's also psychologically stressful because we're looking at people almost within what we call or consider our intimate distance and so our brain is struggling to figure out why are these strangers in the space where my loved ones should be? And at the same time when we've had social distancing our loved ones have actually been in a space that is reserved for acquaintances and people we don't know. So our brains are really struggling to figure out what's going on.\nNC: And Jonny Gifford this can spill out into sort of more mental issues, harder to define perhaps but shortness of temper, we might make decisions hastily, we're just overwhelmed by the sheer weight or work that we've got and this is exacerbated when you're on your own.\nJG: Yeah there's various factors I think included in this which ideally you could look at in their own right. So, as Nilu has already mentioned, there's the attention deficit and the fact of switching between tasks is something which is cognitively demanding on us. So that can be a drain. If, as managers, you can reduce the amounts of time that people are switching from one thing to another then that's going to help. But also yes you've got factors like overall workloads, which often can go up during times of a recession for example, so that's something to bear in mind. Workload can also go up just when there's organisational change and the massive move to homeworking has obviously been a big instance of organisational change. And then there's this ongoing, really important aspect of the autonomy that people have, whether people are empowered to take control over their work. So there's a number of different factors at play here.\nNC: And Marc Weedon what's serious about this is that employers may not be picking up the way they're now working is maybe causing people to experience some of these problems so I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you try and pick up on issues and how you can start to try and relieve them, in other words what should HR be doing about all this?\nMW: So the main thing is just to stay close to what is going on and there are forewarned, informal ways of doing that. So for example within my own business we do very regular surveys, pulse surveys, and we've adapted the questions for the COVID environment where we specifically ask questions about how people are feeling about their work/life balance.\nNC: How do you know people tell the truth though, they might just say everything's fine when it isn't?\nMW: We do follow ups. So we've had focus groups for example where we've created channels firstly for managers so that they can share ideas around how to recognise signs of stress or overwork or dealing with work/life balance, and they can share ideas which have worked for them, articles in the press around how to deal with it etc. And we also do that for employees where everybody can make comments around how they've been experiencing things and things which they're doing themselves which have worked for them. So it's all around transparency, open communications, trust, and just creating that environment where people feel that they can actually come forward and say things.\nNC: Can you just give us an example of things you've picked up and then what you might have changed?\nMW: This week alone I've probably had at least two, possibly three, conversations where people have come forward to me saying that they have been struggling with their work/life balance, so we've talked about how that's manifesting itself, what they've been doing so far to try and resolve those particular issues. I've referenced our work/life manifesto before, so we go back into the work/life manifesto to see what ideas they've used and what other ideas they might want to use. So the fact that I've had three people this week alone approaching me as the HR director that's kind of indicative that people do feel comfortable coming forward and that they do know that the company has their back where they are struggling with these sorts of issues.\nNC: And Nilu you counsel people do you think everybody calls HR and gets some satisfaction here?\nNA: I'd be quite cautious about that, Marc sounds like he's got a really fabulous company and people are coming to him but I wonder if it is as open as HR would like to think it is. People often, when we see people in clinics and clients, they are very worried about divulging any stresses to their employers for lack of understanding about stress and often people don't understand themselves, they think I've got stress, that's really normal in the workplace, and that begins to trickle down and have a really big impact on their work, on their productivity, on their mental health before they even recognise it. Many people think that talking to HR about mental health issues might result in them potentially losing their job or being seen as weak and not being able to get the support. And I've spoken to people who do have mental health programmes at work and they're not really appropriate for that particular group. So somebody I spoke to said, my workplace has got a really great mental health service but it's for white people, by white people. And so it's not reaching all of the diversity of employees at all times.\nMW: I do acknowledge what Nilu is saying and there's organisations I've known and organisations I've worked for, for example, where there wouldn't be people coming forward to HR with these particular issues. Within our company part of our advice might be when they do come to us is, you know, we have an employee assistance programme for example so where there is reticence about approaching a boss or a colleague or HR about mental health issues or other issues which they perceive as quite sensitive then we direct them to the employee assistance programme which is independent of the company, is confident, and it's advice to instant professional counselling services and support. So that is one of the areas which we do promote as well.\nNC: So Jonny Gifford does the CIPD have anything to say about how proactive HR is in these kind of situations?\nJG: Indeed it does. I mean the last year has seen both a huge increase in the focus on wellbeing, not just on physical wellbeing and the COVID pandemic itself but on things like mental wellbeing at work. So we see that with our members within the HR community but also we see that with other business leaders. There really is a big wave of increased interest in the area of workplace wellbeing. And at the same time the pandemic has pushed many employers to support flexible working in a way which has not happened previously.\nNC: But there is clearly a gap Jonny between best practice, the kind of things which professionals like to exchange ideas about and the reality of all these tech stats and in a way the technology kind of dominating how people work and maybe senior managers just not picking up on how people are feeling and how it's affecting their productivity?\nJG: I think that it's more how technology is used that dominates people's work and just as it's management practices that dominate people's work rather than technology itself. What I'd say though is that because of the increase on wellbeing, the changes in how we work over the last year, there is a big opportunity for employers to really take stock and to make sure that they are focusing on wellbeing and work/life balance and related areas in a way which they haven't done before. So there are some real opportunities, there is some appetite to follow through with them. At the same time we do need to be careful, there is the potential, as I say with mobile technology in particular, to be always on, and just because we can always be available it doesn't mean that we should. On the contrary we need to be particularly careful about protecting our work/life boundaries. So there are risks but there's also I think a great appetite to take stock and move on positively from the huge changes that we've seen in the last year.\nNC: So Dr Nilu Ahmed let's have some practical ideas both for individuals and organisations to try and avoid the worst of these issues, to get the best of technology without some of the disadvantages.\nNA: For individuals it's really simple tips that people find very difficult to put into place: so it's trying to establish a boundary between your work life and your home life if you're working as I do at the dining room table, pop everything in a box at the end of the day so you're not looking at it, you don't have to see it you can at least create that visual barrier for your brain, and that's one you start to work on one thing at a time to try and take your mind off work.\nTry and do a fake commute or something I always recommend to people, even if it's a five minute walk around the block, as soon as you're out of the house five minutes can become ten especially if the weather's nice, you don't have to go to your workplace and come back just get outside and then at the end of the day do the same thing as well, so you're mentally switching off from work.\nIf possible don't use the camera. Zoom meetings we're not used to seeing people looking at us all the time and nor do we look at everyone when we're in a meeting surrounded by people we only look at one or two people in a meeting and it's the same as being in a lift, when you're in a lift you don't look at anyone, everyone looks at the floor, but Zoom meetings are like being in a lift and forced to look at everyone, and that's really uncomfortable. So try not to put that pressure on yourself. And organisations can encourage staff to keep their cameras off when they're in meetings as well so that we don't have that on our brains as well.\nNC: Marc Weedon I could see you nodding, obviously you go for a little run around the block before you start work in the morning, what other tips have you used as an organisation to take the pressure off people in ways that you can?\nMW: Yeah so some of the tips which Nilu mentioned for sure we do those, so we're emphasising you don't always have to be on, use 'do not disturb' in your collaboration tools, don't respond to emails at times at which you wouldn't be expected to work, carve out that beginning and end time. At a more practical level what we found last year for example people were really reluctant to take their annual leave entitlement, just because I couldn't go away somewhere nice and sunny. So we actually said, do take your annual leave because it's important just to take that step away from Zoom and that break from you're emails, so even though you can't go away and it's got to be close to home do take your annual leave. So we emphasised that as well. We've talked about diet, so making sure that you're enjoying a balanced diet and having at least one decent meal a day, and away from your laptop as well. Looking after the eyes is really important because if you've had sustained time staring at your laptop during Zoom calls just making sure that you regularly look into the distance, you're blinking rapidly, you're keeping your eyes moist because they quite often get overlooked. We've also recognised that people are missing the office strangely because there is a social dimension there, so particularly during the first lockdown, we've changed a little bit during the more recent ones, we've tried to replicate that social dimension with virtual events, I've got to say voluntary, so we weren't making people attend these things but just arranging virtual events which people could come into if they wanted to.\nNC: What another office quiz?\nMW: Yes I hold my hand up we did have quizzes but we also had things like just casual things like coffee mornings, we had beer and pizza, we had virtual poker nights and just drop ins. So just having a Zoom room which was open, people could just drop in and have a chat and it's not work-related it's just having that social chat.\nNC: Some of this is really well meant but Jonny Gifford I'm feeling a little bit queasy about this if I've already spent the day with people do I have to spend the night as well?\nJG: Well perhaps not the night but I think that the tips and the kind of hacks that Marc and Nilu have been mentioning are really useful, you know, it speaks to the fact that we're habitual creatures and we need to incorporate little tricks on how we can work in ways which are not just effective but healthy. One thing that I would add is that we really need to get to the bottom of how to have effective meetings. Rather than just bundling everyone into hour long meetings, anyone who's got a vaguely relevant role to play to be included in Zoom meetings and you end up with massive 20 plus people in Zoom meetings, we need to think about how to make the best use of people's time, to be more selective about who needs to be in individual meetings, how we manage the return to work is like another complexity which is coming at us, so with some people in the office some people not, how do you manage meeting there? But I think effective use of meetings, effective use of time between meetings, so can you take stuff out of the meetings like a presentation or looking at material and getting people to do that between meetings.\nNC: Do you think some of this stuff falls between HR and management because as you say that I can see yeah that's a fantastic idea but actually who's going to ensure that it happens because it's kind of a bit organisational but it's to do with getting the job done and there's nobody in the driving seat of this, everything's become rather rudderless hasn't it in this new way of working?\nJG: So much of people management falls between the dedicated HR function, remember not even all organisations have an HR function, and line managers. So yes absolutely it's a shared responsibility. But for example HR functions have a clear role to play in sending messages about what's expected, about what's important, encouraging managers for example to empower their employees so that they can choose how they do their work and even when they do their work so that they've got more control over their work/life balance. So it's a shared responsibility.\nNC: Dr Nilu what do you think about that because you hear this from the sharp end with people who are not getting on so well at work at the moment?\nNA: I think having very well switched on managers is absolutely key, people are much more likely to talk to their managers before they go to HR but their managers are that sort of median link between HR and the person doing the job and so to make sure that managers are really clued up and are able to feel confident in offering flexibility, not everyone will want to continue to work from home but some people will. I was in a five hour meeting yesterday and I just thought, do I really need to be here? But they're easier to attend. One of the things I've found since working in lockdown is actually I can attend these for four or five hours because I can multitask.\nNow we know that that actually makes you less productive and is terrible for your mental health and terrible for all the things that we're talking about today but part of me is worrying as with my colleagues is what happens when we return to work will that option be there for some people to log in remotely, if they have chosen to take this work/life balance and work from home, or will everyone be expected to turn up at work for these long meetings? And those are decisions that do have to be made at an HR and senior management level before people come back into work, but these are the worries that people are thinking about now as we think about returning to work is that how is it going to look in the workplace.\nNC: And Marc Weedon have you seen a change in managers as they wrestle with all this? I know before you were telling me a story about a particular manager who was finding it very difficult to adjust to employees having this power and not having to be under his thumb all the time?\nMW: From my perspective the role of the manager has actually come to the fore during COVID, it's been a very traumatic time for many, it's been a big disrupter. And so the role of leaders is as important as ever and before COVID you had certain types of leaders which liked seeing people in the office, you had others who were more relaxed and this has been kind of a level set amongst that and a way to emphasise what good leadership actually means. So the sorts of discussions we've been having with our managers is simple things, making sure you're having regular check ins.\nSecondly showing up as empathetic, so how are you, how's your family, what's going on in your life, is there anything I could be doing to help you be more productive or manage your work/life balance better? So we're trying to encourage managers to get close, stay close, make it genuine. Equally they need to tend to the team and its dynamics, so if the team is remote just making sure what impact that is having on its ability to perform as a team. I think Nilu mentioned already it's empowering people to have more say over how they structure their work, so that's important as well for the management perspective.\nAnd then the final thing I'd say is just letting people know that it's okay to prioritise domestic issues over work related issues. There's been this collision of work/life as people have said before. So it's fine, there are going to be distractions. You might not always show up face to face. You might not always be always on. You might have to rush downstairs to open the door for the UPS guy. And just letting people know that that's fine and we accept that.\nNC: And of course Nilu there is the danger here that we might see this as a little bit too negative as we talked about some of the downsides of the sort of digital changes we've seen in the office but like for example now you can get a doctor's consultation and maybe referred to a specialist or something much more efficiently. I mean there are a lot of benefits that have come out of the ability to get things done without seeing people face to face?\nNA: So much benefit and I think we'll see those benefits really bloom as we come out of lockdown because then we'll be able to move around in a less restricted way, so all the little things that we couldn't do before that maybe actually I'll go to a gym class at 9:30 and I know I can work my day around that, I can start work a bit earlier or I can finish a bit later because I don't have the commute to do as well. So there are things that people can really begin to take advantage of, people who have care responsibilities that makes their life so much easier to be able to work from home, people who maybe have chronic illnesses or do suffer from anxiety and worry about the impact of just getting into work, the fatigue of that. So there are lots and lots of benefits for lots of individual groups, but generally in society I think we know that a happy workforce is a much more productive workforce, is a much more loyal workforce, you get greater retention of staff, greater productivity. So working to understand how we can best meet the needs of a really generally diverse workforce to be able to offer that ebb and flow. What the lockdown has done is it's shown organisations that actually this works. Working from home really does work and so that should be something that we can really build into practices going forward.\nNC: Great and a lot of that Jonny Gifford is kind of reflected in the CIPD's work, the latest health and wellbeing report?\nJG: Yeah and evidence reviews that we've put out for example on supporting employee resilience and then a new one we've got coming out soon on mental wellbeing and digital work. I would agree with Nilu certainly that there are opportunities. I think that these are opportunities that need to be consciously and deliberately grasped because there is a real danger that we just return to default, as we come out of lockdown we just go back to the old habits, setting up hour long meetings, face to face, everyone has to be in the office, even if the work that they could be doing from home. So I think that there are real opportunities to grasp here. We've seen huge changes, we've shown ourselves that many more people can work from home for example than we previously thought, we just need to make sure that we take that learning and embed it into how we're managing people.\nNC: And I know mental health is often seen on a spectrum from depression to flourishing. I was struck by the New York Times referring to what it called, the neglected middle child or mental health, languishing, not good, not thoroughly depressed but an absence of wellbeing, which certainly dulls your focus. So seeing friends and colleagues languishing might also be a sign of their digital fatigue. We certainly all need a work reset when we start to languish. Lots of good ideas that we've heard today to help, loads more as I say on the CIPD website, including that latest health and wellbeing report, but many thanks to our guest Dr Nilu Ahmed, Marc Weedon and Jonny Gifford.

      "summary": "The pandemic has accelerated the evolution of the workplace, perhaps years before many organisations were ready to take the leap. But as we begin our recovery from the pandemic, businesses will have a big decision to make. Do we want to return to a ‘tweaked’ version of normality or are organisations prepared to map out a bold new vision for how we work and better use the physical workplace?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, David D’Souza, Membership Director at CIPD, Polly Mackenzie, Chief Executive at Demos, and Rachel King, People Director at Camelot, as we explore how business can reimagine and modernise three key elements of work: the physical workplace, working practices and working relationships.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:31:59\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Business life after lockdown, how to build back better and avoid slipping into old routines, I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nNow if we're honest I reckon most of us have at least some of what psychologists call return anxiety, crowded transport, face to face meetings, wearing masks, making small talk. More to the point are our workplaces safe? A year since our old way of working came to a screeching halt it's goodbye and maybe good riddance to the 9 to 5 but what will replace it? In many ways it's being left to people managers to organise what we keep hearing will be our new hybrid working lives, trying to build on all that initiative that flexibility, the trustworthiness, all those human and digital skills which got us through the last year. So stay with us as we home in on the future from a physical workplace for working practices and how we collaborate.\nWith me the chief of the cross party think tank at Demos, who's indeed been thinking hard about our working lives after COVID, she's Polly Mackenzie. Hello.\nPolly Mackenzie: Hi There.\nNC: And bringing her experience in the media, technology, retail and hospitality sectors it's Camelot's people director, Rachel King. Hello.\nRachel King: Hello there.\nNC: And from the home team one of the UK's most influential workplace commentators the CIPD's membership director David D'Souza. Hi.\nDavid D'Souza: Hello.\nNC: So let's start with the big picture and with Polly Mackenzie. We're at this kind of inflection point aren't we with everything changing at warp speed, what do you reckon we've learnt so far about the new working world, not least from that rather abortive return we had last year?\nPM: Thanks Nigel. So I mean it's complicated and I think all the different workplaces are approaching this in lots of different ways. Some barely opened their offices at all whereas some pushed, encouraged and tried to get people back into the office. I started buying the newspapers to try and lure some of my staff back to the office in the Autumn last year, we now have a large pile of newspapers lying unwanted in our empty office. But what we know overall is that most of the people who were able to change their workplace and work from home over the course of this pandemic year quite liked it. It's not everybody of course, we will all have examples of somebody who has no quiet space to work at home, it might be domestic violence, it might just simply be that there's no decent chair, all sorts of different reasons, and especially young people more likely to not be happy working at home but nevertheless on average people liked it and they do want to go back to the office, a bit, sometimes they're reluctant about the commute. And they're expecting that most employers will flex to offer those kind of hybrid options. And including more flexibility around working times, not just working places.\nNC: Okay well we'll talk about the practicalities of getting so many people back in a moment but let's just go to David, you've said, it's time to stop this everybody in or everybody out debate, what do you mean by that?\nDD'S: I think there's been some very lazy commentary in this space over the last year. So you've had some really polarised arguments about whether everyone needs to be in an office for it to be successful, or everyone needs to be working from home, or whether the future's hybrid. And actually this should be a conversation about mature use of flexible practices. That's where we need to get far better, far more inclusive in the way that we work. And the other thing that needs to be not left behind is a focus on people who don't have a choice over their location about where they work. And some of those interestingly will work in organisations where other people do have a choice so this is a real crisis point for us in terms of needing a mature approach to what we do next, whereas in fact what you see in the media quite often is a very polarised, quite outraged approach to the conversation that really isn't helpful. This shouldn't be a people on one side and people on the other, this should be about how do we come together to solve actually a societal problem that impacts most people because work matters.\nNC: And I mean quite a range of responses we've had to all this I mean from those tech employers telling their people they can work from home forever to Goldman Sachs all but ordering staff to get back to their office desks just as soon as possible. And then I suppose there's the people in between who've just, as we've already heard, kind of soldiered on regardless in public facing roles or there's of course also the people who may be secretly quite enjoyed having most of the workplace to themselves if they came in on their own. So let's look at the future of the physical office, or at least the people aspects of it, Rachel King, at Camelot you've got what 500 - 600 of your 900 people on two main sites, so tell us how you're approaching this kind of phased migration back?\nRK: Thanks Nigel. I think, as you referred to, last year we had a bit of an aborted attempt to get people back into the office. We've worked really hard to get our offices COVID-safe and have really invested a lot of time and effort in reworking the floor space, taking out desks, making sure that we absolutely comply with COVID-safe regulations and last year we started fazing people back in, in slightly larger numbers.\nNC: What proportion can you squeeze in?\nRK: We can get just under half our people back in, in a COVID-safe world but actually we didn't have the demand at that time for people to actually want to come back in, so people were very sensible and we actually prioritised people who were struggling at home because either they haven't got the greatest environments at home, or there are elements of their job that are actually just quite hard to do at home in a remote way. We prioritised them. So we've worked really hard on COVID-safe environment. We've got a bit more to do but it is really great. What we're grappling with now is what does the future look like in terms of physical space and what's the optimum use of physical space. But I think to David's point it's much more complex than are you at home or are you in the office, because we've had people working in our buildings throughout the pandemic and they're just as worried about people coming back into their very safe personal sort of physical space during that time, so we've got to be very thoughtful about them too.\nNC: You were also telling me beforehand that collaboration, which is what people keep telling us the office is going to be primarily for, actually takes more room than somebody just working in their own cell.\nRK: Yes I mean we don't want people to come back in and sit at their desks and do their emails and dial onto calls, we want people to come back in and we've talked a lot with our people about what's the most value you get out of the office. And that's actually collaboration, it's face to face contact, it's those serendipitous moments where you're in a queue for a coffee and you see somebody who you didn't have a scheduled planned meeting with but you're going to have a chat with them and other things will come out of those conversations. So all of that by chance environment that we're really missing and the opportunity to get back face to face. I actually popped into the office last week to do something that couldn't be done in a virtual way and I just felt so energised personally by seeing some real people. And that gave me a lift for the next couple of days of working virtually at home.\nNC: What do you think about that Polly? I mean it does raise this question what is the purpose of the physical workplace?\nPM: I think, I mean we're certainly picking up lots of stories of people reconfiguring their workspaces. As Rachel says, you know, you mostly don't want people, unless it's the only safe place or the only private space where they can, whether it's working on secure data or can just sit there and concentrate all day, you mostly do want people to come in for collaboration. And what we've done with our office is a kind of microcosm of what much bigger employers are doing is we've taken what used to be a small event space and we've converted that into a couple of rows of desks and taken what used to be the rows of desks and turned it into a big event space with big tables, lots of whiteboards, chalk pens and you know, it's a collaboration space. It's enabling people to come and do the think tanky stuff and I'm sure that lots of employers will be thinking about that. Or it's the physical manifestation of how you generate ideas and so often add value, and that is so difficult to go home. You know, I'm sure we've all tried virtual whiteboards or electronic post-it notes, none of these things work really do they? Nothing is quite as great as a highlighter pen.\nNC: I saw a Deloitte report for Liberty Global on the future of work and they talk about collaboration, innovation and celebration, as three things that you could do in the office, David D'Souza, all this takes an enormous amount of management and this is being put on the shoulders of people managers, the HR department, but it's actually fundamental to how organisations function.\nDD'S: Yeah there's nothing more important than helping the talent in your organisation flourish and have the best environment for doing that and that's environment in the broadest sense, the people around them and the physical environment around them. The advantage that we have is that actually this has happened for years and so some organisations have worked purely remotely for years, some have done mixed method for years, so there's a bank of research to draw on and a bank of examples from organisations and in fact what we're going through at the moment is relatively atypical because people are having to cope with a pandemic in the background as well. So Polly's got some great stats, we have at the CIPD as well, that we've done regular polling, but the pinch of salt that I'll add to any of that polling is that you're asking people in the middle of a crisis when they can't see friends and family and when lots of their liberties have been compromised or removed for public necessity. I think what will happen when we open up a bit more is that we'll get some people rushing back in and then actually they'll settle into kind of a calmer equilibrium in the middle. But the point around management is really, really important because we know that trust is absolutely key to getting people to work in this way and historically managers have tended to like to be able to see the people around them to feel that somehow just being near them is giving them some kind of performance by osmosis through their natural inspiration. And we've seen that from a group of CEOs, I need you back in the office because I bring fire to it, this is where the drive happens, and we've just got to be a lot more mature in terms of creating trust.\nNC: When you say that you're kind of slightly putting it on senior managers, just wanting to control where people are but Rachel King there is a point isn't there that when you have those random encounters with people who you maybe don't directly work with that's actually valuable and you were telling me before that people have lost that working from home.\nRK: Yes we've definitely noticed the sphere of people you actually interact with is much, much smaller. So I'm spending a lot of time with my executive team and a lot of time with my direct team and there are so many people that I would normally contact and bump into that aren't in my schedule and our lives are much more scheduled and we just don't have that free time. So some of the things we've been doing is creating a few more random encounters or putting in odd random telephone calls to people that I might normally bump into that I don't otherwise, and just say, hello I'm just giving you a ring, how are you? What's happening? And once they get over the initial shock and think, oh my goodness why is the People Director ringing me, actually those are interesting moments where you just say, how's it going and what are you working on that's a priority at the moment? So we're trying to recreate those.\nNC: Okay so let's move a bit from how we're going to use the physical office in the future to working practice, collaboration, all the stuff that goes on wherever you are and Polly Mackenzie we know that everything's changed here, a lot of knowledge tasks have suddenly been automated, so workers certainly we know now need to be good communicators, we need more exacting skills and everything, how do you see that whole thing changing as we go back to work?\nPM: I think definitely we need to have a shift in how people are managed and supervised, lots of managers have relied for a long time on just being able to see who's working hard and evaluating people that way. And this system of not being able to see people creates a pressure which some people are kind of using an outlet for that pressure is surveillance software and webcam monitoring of their staff, but I think more managers are thinking more creatively about what is it that I actually need from somebody? What are the outputs and the outcomes I expect? And how do I manage for that? And I think that's really welcome.\nThere's lots and lots of practical challenges though including chairing meetings. So chairing a meeting on Zoom is really quite different from chairing a meeting in the office and both are different from chairing a meeting which is hybrid. Now most of the people I speak to in HR would much prefer that you don't really have hybrid meetings because the danger is it creates a sort of second tier, anybody who's in there virtually isn't really in the meeting and they get left out, but the reality is that then you might have lots of people who are in the office who are then forced to sit around a desk with their headphones on, completely closed off to recreate the virtual environment for the people who are outside. And exactly how you manage that, genuinely difficult. So how do you coordinate who's in the office, who's out of the office, because if you get everybody to come in on say Mondays and Wednesdays you lose the benefit of flexibility but you also lose the benefit of being able to downsize or reconfigure your office because you've got the same peak need for desks and chairs but without it always being full. So honestly at this point it just feels like we're in, as David said, a sort of period of experimentation and learning and the more HR people, people directors can share those learnings and insights and experiments, because lots of them will go wrong, I think the faster we will learn.\nNC: David what have you observed about how people can best be managed in this new environment?\nDD'S: I think organisations have come to terms quite well over the last year with the immediate management of people. I think it started off with just replicating what everyone was doing in the office virtually, and we know that that doesn't work and most organisations learnt quite a tough lesson there. So you're seeing some of the more mature processes that Rachel's talked about, so being more mindful of how you create time and space for people. I think the biggest challenge is actually some of the longer term issues that we'll face around things like people development and connection and identification of talent, because they're a lot harder to do potentially, remotely than they were in person and we need to be really careful about things like share of voice, development opportunities, because lots of things naturally people would have picked up by sitting next to someone. Joining a company you learn about the culture by sitting there, seeing how people interact around you and when you've got a problem knowing when it's a quiet time to ask the person next to you. We've lost that, we can replicate some of that digitally but there are definitely some challenges there. And as I say talent identification I think is the biggest challenge. How are you going ensure that you're promoting the right people in an environment like this and not just the noisy voices?\nNC: So Rachel King how are you approaching managing people and ensuring that there is more collaboration but of course you get the job done?\nRK: Well we're trying to look at it as a balance. So trying to assess productivity and also create those moments of collaboration and I think it's partly accepting about the way you organise work, so you need to leave spaces in meetings. We need to schedule meetings slightly differently, we need to leave gaps between meetings and think about how people plan their day. So for example with my team we have a much less packed agenda on a meeting that we might have had in the office but actually in the virtual world we recognise that we need to build in time for the informal discussion. I've actually experienced a hybrid sort of set of meetings throughout the pandemic in parts of the unlock of the lockdown and I was the one at home and a lot of my colleagues were in the office and some really basic things like making sure the acoustics and the technology in whatever building you're in enable the person remotely to really participate well and the initial meeting banter that happens you're not excluding the people that are looking in if you're not careful. So lots of the things about dynamics.\nTo David's point about how you bring people in and on board them, we've hired about 145 people throughout the pandemic and we've created some of the on boarding experiences in a virtual way to try and help people get to know the company even though we're all virtually working. And I think we've done a really fantastic job on that but there's still something missing for people who join the organisation. And I've got a couple of new people in my team, one of whom I met last week and I'd never met her in person, had no idea how tall she was, so that was an absolute delight to meet somebody and just get that very human picture of somebody that you just can't do and perhaps a bit of extra connection. So I think there are some practical things for us and definitely how do you replicate that we're all sitting at a bank of desks and I can overhear things and I'm learning from the person next to me? We haven't cracked that.\nPM: So sometimes when we collaborate on a document we've been using Discord, which is normally used by gamers who are playing in a virtual world is we just open a Discord server and it's as if you're sitting next to the office and you can hear the other person tapping away or moving their coffee and then you can kind of share those random opportune thoughts about the...\nNC: And can you use a weapon if they annoy you?\nPM: Absolutely, absolutely and there's elves and stuff, no, that would be fun. But it just really helps. It's funny how recreating those, the microscopic feeling of the office can help you feel that you're collaborating and I know there are new technologies opening up to do those sorts of things or to, whatever, generate random coffees for you to have or to try and replicate that, but I think as Rachel says, in the end the watercooler moments mostly have to involve an actual watercooler.\nNC: Because I mean David it's almost as if organisations have suddenly been stress-testing their ability to blend people and technology, things that some have said they should have done years ago and suddenly they're doing it and actually the technology is found wanting sometimes?\nDD'S: I'm not sure the technology is found wanting, so to Polly's point there are lots of use cases where people have been utilising technology to collaborate effectively.\nNC: Well it's available but they don't have it.\nDD'S: Yeah I mean you only have to look at something as impressive a project as Wikipedia to know that people can collaborate and produce something incredibly impressive without, but organisations are slightly different to just being about the work because longer term they're about social capital, they're about relationships, they're about culture, they're about a whole range of things that then drive that productivity. So lots of organisations went from being ten or 15 years behind the curve to being where they need to be in terms of tech, quite rapidly over the last year, that brings the learning curve in terms of how to use those products and the integration of them with the way that people work but we need to remember that it's not about the technology that's an enabler, it's about how the organisation chooses to be with its people, support its people and ultimately help them to be successful on the organisation's behalf.\nNC: So David do you want to say any more about productivity and how we achieve that with a very different way of working?\nDD'S: Well I think the key is to focus on the outcomes that people produce rather than the amount of times they're present. So you've seen it in offices for years which is the last person to leave is the person that's believed to be most effective, but Bill Gates used to have a lovely saying which is, if I want something complex done I'll give it to the laziest person I know because they'll find the easiest way to do it. And I think we need to refocus in organisations on what people are producing not just how long they are there because actually whether it's in an office or whether it's at home it shouldn't be able how long you're logged in for, it should be about what you're producing and developing for the organisation and how you're moving it along.\nNC: Is that something you've seen in any of your research Polly? A lot of people complain about presenteeism.\nPM: I think it's really important. There's a lot of concern about being remotely monitored and spied upon. Somehow it is much worse to have a sense that your boss is tracking everything you're doing when they can't see you than it is for them just glancing across the desk and seeing what you're up to. And so the way to build trust is to focus on measuring people's outputs. And really harnessing the benefits of people being away from the office, not having to commute, most people actually will give a bit of that commuting time back to their employer rather than taking it for themselves, but in return they might want to do an hour before breakfast or an hour after they've put the kids to bed, and just be a bit more flexible in the middle of the day and I think that can benefit all of us.\nNC: And Rachel King do you have to sometimes remind senior managers about this trust people thing?\nRK: Well we've actually got a different issue and we're having to remind our people to sort of give themselves some time. We're actually finding people are working longer, they're logging on earlier, they're logging off later and they're actually already using, in many cases, their commuting time. So on the wellbeing point we've given a lot of guidance to people to say we're not watching you, we're not expecting you to necessarily work the normal day. And for those people that have got children of school age they've had a very, very practical issue over the last few months where they may well be two adults in a house, both working full time, with young children in the house, trying to manage childcare. So we've had to say to people, think really differently about your work day and talk to your manager about how you might need to schedule that so you can get your output delivered but you can do it in a completely different way. Of course there are people, some of whom their jobs can't be done like that, they've got quite a fixed schedule, they might be taking phone calls, they might be in a warehouse environment, so they don't have that control over their work, and again that creates not a one size fits all that we need to manage really carefully from a cultural point of view.\nNC: David mental health in the workplace is something that comes up in a lot of these podcasts, we know the last year has tested families and homeworkers, in some cases to near breaking point, I did see one large bank commissioning a sudden mental health audit, I mean is that good or does it just suggest they weren't actually doing enough as this has played out?\nDD'S: So a couple of points, first of all I would say again it's not just about home workers this has to be about the whole system and everyone working in the economy, organisations weren't good enough in terms of their duty of care in the main, towards people in terms of mental wellbeing in particular, so wellbeing in general. I think what we've seen is some leap forwards. I think what's really important is what we keep and hold from this point onwards, and it's genuinely not about initiatives, it's not about have you bought an app. That's symbolic of the fact you're prepared to invest but actually going forward it's about job crafting, it's about balance, it's about genuine inclusion for people, so understanding the circumstances going on in their lives. I think we've seen a rapid maturing but again it's still not where it needs to be in many organisations, and for the organisations that have progressed there are probably going to be some quite turbulent economic times ahead, we need to make sure that actually that isn't lost and we continue caring. One of the things that we have had is we've all had a shared experience, we've experienced in different ways, but a shared experience that every CEO of an organisation will have known someone who's been ill or they will have lost someone, and that helps with the empathy and the treatment of people down the line. When work goes back to normal quite often what you see is that empathy gap between leadership and the people doing frontline roles and we need to keep that closed.\nNC: And Rachel what conversations are you having with people?\nRK: It's really interesting because I think we were in a lucky position that we had put a lot of the foundations in place around good mental health, or recognising mental health is part of our responsibility as an employer. And I remember right at the start of the pandemic when we got together as an exec team and were really in that moment of oh my goodness who thought we were going to be facing into this? And what it enabled us to do as a senior team was explicitly check in on each other, so for the first time we started our meetings saying, how is everyone? How are you? And we'd go around the room saying, do you know what actually I'm struggling and this is why, or actually I'm having a good day, how can I help you? We would never have done that on a regular basis in the past. So it has become a bit more of our language. Now albeit we don't do that every time now but we still remember it and still somebody can say, actually here's the thing on my worry list at the moment, and we're much more connected. We've been really explicit with our people that their wellbeing is our number one priority. We worry about that first, keeping people safe, and secondly it's then the operational resilience and performance of our business. And we've kept that as a thread.\nTo David's point when do you stop putting that as a priority for your people? And how do you take that forward? So it has really made us think differently. Personally on an audit I think lots of people would feel quite suspicious if their employer suddenly started doing a wellbeing audit on them, so it really has to be framed in the culture that you have created so that people understand the intent behind it. But I think this has given us an opportunity. We've also opened up a lot more conversation about diversity and inclusion through the pandemic, so actually recognising that we're different and having different experiences, reacting differently and that has helped us have a lot more conversation and progress those conversations over the last 12 months.\nNC: Okay and this has become tradition now, let me just get one more thought to finish from each of you, maybe starting with Polly looking at making the new world of work, work basically and be more effective and better for people.\nPM: I think what Rachel's saying is really important that wellbeing and productivity aren't in opposition actually, you know, happy staff are much more likely to be successful and effective at work, and whether that's worrying about their financial wellbeing, their mental health or just the practicalities of their living circumstances, it is actually in employers' interests and I think because we've been exposed to each other's homes in this really intimate and extraordinary way so much over the last year we're able to see that and make that pivot. People who have been remote working are more likely to be volunteering, they're more likely to have strengthened their relationship with friends and family, they're more likely to be exercising more, they're more likely to be eating better. Across the board this flexibility, and I think it's flexibility of time as well as place, is really, really improving the lives of lots and lots of workers and so long as you can be adaptive and flexible and recognise, you know, some people do need to come to the office, there's a real opportunity there to make work a place of meaning and effectiveness and not just a suck on your wellbeing that's for the sake of a pay cheque.\nNC: And David D'Souza.\nDD'S: The challenge for me, and it's maybe an unfair challenge, is one about congruence, so it's about do things line up. So if you've taken a strong stance around inclusion over the last 12 months when you get a survey back saying nine in ten people are happy working this way, do you focus on what the one in ten person needs? Because actually you may find that actually that's a group you're completely underserving. Likewise when you're thinking about wellbeing are you thinking about apps and interventions there or are you thinking about the construct of jobs? You can't have a strong stance of wellbeing and remove two people from a team and ask it to perform at the same level as before. I think we need to be really mature about what we're asking. And the narrative that we send out needs to reconcile with the reality that we provide people. So everything's been thrown up in the air, we've got some agency over where it comes down, that's brilliant and an incredible time for the profession but that's what we need to focus on.\nNC: And from what David says Rachel that's not just about how you do your job as a people manager but that's about how you reflect to your senior managers what's possible and what works.\nRK: Yes I think for us it's to the earlier point of trust and adult tone. So we have a way of working at the moment that has been successful, this is now another phase where we've got to demonstrate we still have trust in our people that we can work with them in a new way and we're going to create the way forward, thinking about whether it's the nine in ten are happy working one way or the one in ten that has got a different view, but how do we craft that future, which is more complex, that needs to build on all the things we've learnt and done really brilliantly in the pandemic but address the things that have been less successful. So it's a sort of, for us, phase two of ways of working and again we'll be tested in how we do that. And I'm thoughtful about organisations quickly moving to developing a set of rules for the workplace versus a set of guidelines to help guide managers think practically about how you make it work. We've got record levels of engagement so how do we keep that record level of engagement as we move into this next, more complex, phase and how do we get the balance right when, to Polly's point, some things won't work, and how do we learn from that in a really good way?\nNC: Well absolutely I mean without being melodramatic it does strike me from what we've heard from our guests today this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build back better. And it took a pandemic to break down the resistance to change and what a lost opportunity it would be if that resistance to change is allowed to return.\nLet me thank our excellent guests this month Camelot's Rachel King, Polly Mackenzie from Demos and David D'Souza here at the CIPD.

Without tangible evidence, it is becoming increasingly harder for L&D professionals to inform strategic decision-making or budget considerations.   \nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, Andy Lancaster, Head of Learning at the CIPD, Laura Overton, co-creator of Emerging Stronger, and Owen Ferguson, Chief Product Officer at Emerald Works, to hear how L&D professionals are moving to adopt evidence-based practice that drives forward impact.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:35:06\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: You're up to your ears in online courses and professional training plans but what evidence is there that your learning and development is actually any good?\nHello I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast. There's a great old cartoon, you may have seen it, two Neolithic looking types in loin cloths are sweating as they try and pull a box filled with stones uphill. Another looks on, offering them an axle and two stone wheels but they wave away the offer shouting, 'No thanks we're much too busy!' So are we too busy to learn, too busy to look for evidence that our workplace learning is actually hitting the spot and therefore worth what the organisation is paying for it? Well stand by for everything about evidence based learning that you've been afraid to ask. We've some top guests waiting in the wings to help us, but first, and right alongside me for this podcast a CIPD-er steeped in professional development, so much so he was at the heart of developing the institute's new L&D qualification it's Andy Lancaster, Head of Learning at the CIPD. Hi Andy.\nAndy Lancaster: Hi Nigel great to be with you.\nNC: Yeah I'm guessing if people as you what you do at a party, assuming that we'll ever go to a party again soon, you might not say, 'I'm in evidence based learning and development.' It's a bit scary isn't it?\nAL: I think it is but being in learning and development is the role we have and what we're looking for is for effective learning that has a real impact in organisations. So I think great learning is an inherent thing that we're looking for evidence based practice which really drives forward impact.\nNC: Yeah I mean could we just start with a definition here, I mean what is evidence based learning?\nAL: I wanted to start Nigel just by telling you a story which my grandfather told me, because I think this sets the context for it really well and it's about onions in your socks. My grandfather sadly is no longer with us but he was a real character and he used to come out with these amazing one-liners and on a matter of steering clear of flu and colds he once invited me to put some onions in my socks. Now this is an old folk remedy that what you do is you slice some onions and you put them in your socks underneath your feel on the basis that when you wake up in the morning you'll be cured. Now I looked this up, according to the National Onion Association, and yes there is a National Onion Association, you can still find this remedy on the internet and it originates back to the 1500s, and it was thought in those days that infections were spread by poisonous air. That theory has subsequently been replaced to show that actually germ based theory, germs are, you know, germs are contracted in different ways. So studies have now shown that there isn't a lot of evidence about putting onions in your socks it relies on claims and anecdotes and yet there have been no studies that actually refute that putting onions in your socks will prevent you getting colds and flu.\nAnd in some ways for me Nigel, you ask the question what is evidence based learning all about? That picture really sums it up for me, you know in learning and HR practice and organisations often what we do is based on history. It's anecdotes which have been passed down, it's principles that have neither been proved or dismissed, and now as we focus on evidence based practice what we really need to do is to dispel some of these old theories and anecdotes and we now need to recognise that we can research and we can find principles which are based on real evidence which will inform our impact. So it's time to take the onions out of the socks and actually do things which have real, genuine impact.\nNC: In a way you're almost answering my next question because to me when we sort of embarked on talking about this I thought this topic felt a bit like a no-brainer, I mean surely all organisations will deliver learning and develop their people in ways that are shown or proven to work so I couldn't understand well why wouldn't they, but I mean it's something to do with well we've always done it this way.\nAL: Exactly right and we've got to face some very uncomfortable truths that some of our practice is now outdated and things which maybe may have been worth entertaining in the past now those assumptions have been challenged and are wrong. And I think we also need to be fiercely anti-fad. Sometimes I think in learning there is no bandwagon which learning professionals won't leap on and now we've got to stand back and recognise that it's not about our pet approaches, it's not about what we might like to do, it's not about copying other people who may not have any evidence behind their practice but really fiercely focusing on now doing things which have a direct impact on effective learning and that obviously by nature is going to affect the organisation positively. So yeah we've got much history here Nigel in learning which we've got to now put on one side and we've really got to focus on what is genuinely evidence based practice.\nNC: And thinking about that there are so many things aren't there? I mean the availability of the trainers, how they've always done it, their personal judgement, preferences of individuals, budgets, I mean there are all kinds of things which must seem like reasons why you do things a particular way?\nAL: There are, you know and that's why I'm valuing Laura Overton and Owen Ferguson coming in today who are people who I really esteem in this space who are passionate about great practice, you know genuine evidence based practice. So yeah there's loads of stuff out there but it's now time for us as a profession to stand back and reflect, often we're too busy to do this, to stand back and reflect on what really underpins great learning in organisations and now to emulate that practice rather than some of the hearsay stuff we've done.\nNC: Well you say great learning Andy, I mean this topic has been kicking around for years why has it come to the fore now?\nAL: I think, you know, two words on the lips of most senior leaders is performance and productivity, you know that's a reality. For organisations now to not only thrive but to survive we've got to address the issue of performance and productivity and that's really crucial for us. So if we're going to invest great resources often in learning, both in time and often in budget, it has to have a positive outcome. So I think why it's particularly pertinent now Nigel is because organisations are really focusing on the productivity and performance agenda and rightly so and therefore learning and HR professionals need to now be emulating and demonstrating practice which is going to really drive performance in the organisation.\nNC: And we're going to bring in our guests in just a second but just before we do that I came across a few statistics looking up this topic and I realised this was a live issue when I saw this, and this is from the CIPD, more than a quarter of people surveyed believed they didn't have the skills to make informed evidence based decisions. 96% identify using data and analytics as a priority area, and this was actually from the CEB, now part of Gartner, only 16% of L&D practitioners actually use data and metrics proficiently. Only 25% have the right skills. So I mean that really, all those figures show there's a big deficit here.\nAL: There is, you know and particularly Owen and Laura have been looking at longitudinal studies on this, this has been an ongoing trend, so it is time to break this cycle and there's all sorts of reasons, maybe fear and all these kind of things but now we've got to look at how we can be evidence based practitioners and I'm looking forward to the conversation with Laura and Owen, who I know will bring some great insights around this.\nNC: Okay well let's bring them in right now. Firstly, delighted to welcome somebody whose whole professional career has been focused on supporting leaders and managers. He's chief product officer of Emerald Works and a familiar face from the Good Practice podcast, many people will have followed, it's Owen Ferguson. Hello.\nOwen Ferguson: Hi there Nigel. Good to be here.\nNC: And the co-creator of Emerging Stronger, which is a masterclass in becoming a more effective development leader she's the founder of the Learning Innovation Research's Towards Maturity, Laura Overton. Hi Laura.\nLaura Overton: Hi Nigel thanks for having me here.\nNC: So okay Laura we've just kind of had a very general introduction to this. In my mind I'm still seeing evidence as a kind of tool to evaluate, to improve or even maybe an excuse to dump some existing programmes but I think you say that evidence should be deployed at a much earlier stage, I mean sometimes to question managers or even the nature of the actual projects themselves?\nLO: Yeah I guess for me evidence is all about how we use the information around us to be able to bring proof, you know if we think about evidence in a court it's normally about proof, it's about what do we need to kind of prove? Does this work, to Andy's point earlier, you know, is our practice effective; is it backed up scientifically; does the data kind of show that our practice is effective? But also we use evidence to approve things, you know when we've got good information in our hands then we can work with other people to actually bring them on board, when it's not just opinion that's driving something but we've got real evidence and proof. So to prove, approve, to disprove, you know I think that's also important use of evidence, particularly when we're so caught up in these habits that Andy's just been describing.\nAnd sometimes we have to challenge our own thinking as well as challenge the thinking of those that are around us. So how do we use evidence in that way? And then also evidence to improve. So the whole role of evidence in the way that we are going about our practice how do we improve it, even the way that we just look at something we've just delivered or just been involved with has that worked? In what ways can we continually improve it.\nSo it's not necessarily use of evidence to improve ROI of Learning and Development you know that actually can be quite debilitating sometimes when there are so many factors that actually link back to, but how do we use evidence to prove, improve, disprove and approve? There are just so many different ways in which we can bring evidence into our decision making and into our practice.\nAL: I like the progression of the disprove and approve, I think that's really nice because it is, sometimes we get into a negative mindset Laura about this don't we? It's just about rubbishing everything and sometimes professionally we just see so much of that going on but it is about approving the right things as well, so I think having a critical mind, Nigel, is not about being negative critical it's a positive critical thing and I love that kind of let's approve our practice as well and also, Laura, love that kind of thing we've got to look wider on this one, often this is done far too late isn't it? And I know Owen will probably join us, we've been three Musketeers around this one, this is often too late. So I love this concept about evidence based practice throughout the whole learning process so yeah I'm with you on that one.\nNC: So Owen why are we so bad then at using evidence if, essentially in their heart, most L&D people actually know that they need more evidence why do we just not get on with it?\nOF: Well the simple answer Nigel is that it's quite hard to make that shift because things have been done in a particular way for such a long period of time and the reason that we know that it's difficult is if you're looking at other professional domains there has been quite a struggle at particular points of their evolution to make the jump from being expert opinion led, experience led, to being genuinely evidence led. So Andy mentioned the onions in the socks and the miasma theory of how disease got spread, there's a brilliant book called The Ghost Map and it's all about Dr. John Snow and how he uncovered the actual transmission mechanism of a massive cholera outbreak in London and he managed to track it down to it being carried by water, but the way that he did that was painstaking work to collect data that he could then examine and then test against reality and that was back in the 19th century. It wasn't until the 1970s that a genuine evidence based approach to medicine took hold and it took quite a few people fighting against the people who led the profession through their kind of expert demeanour in order for that change to happen. So it takes some brave people to do some painstaking work but right at the core of it we are talking about figuring out whether the stuff that we do actually works. So it cannot be any more disheartening than doing stuff and not having a degree of surety around that. So if I was to boil down evidence based practice it's doing things in a way that you can have more confidence that your actions are going to have a positive impact and then progressively understanding what's worked and what hasn't in terms of your own activity.\nNC: All right well let's begin and the beginning Laura you must have helped a number of organisations who are stuck at this point so just give us some simple ideas of the kinds of evidence you can gather and how difficult is this, I mean do you need to be a scientist, do you need to really understand data to be able to marshal and then use this information?\nLO: Well that's a great question, do you need to be a scientist? Do you need to be mathematically inclined? Most learning and development professionals really struggle with that and I know Andy you've asked that question many times in the room haven't you and say what's your background? And very few of us come from that kind of arithmetic background. But I think really our best starting point as a learning professional is to be able to tap into our curiosity. If we're genuinely curious about wanting to know more, wanting to be our best selves, wanting to be professional then we can look around and see that data is all around us.\nAnd I think sometimes we're very blinkered when it comes to our attitude towards data and we think what comes out of learning management system or our management information systems? It's very, very blinkered. But with a curious attitude we can actually see that evidence and data is all around us. There is scientific evidence and there are people who have really boiled that down brilliantly in order to help us as mere mortals understand that. And Andy I'll give a shout out to your book here because when other people have looked at what the evidence says about good practice and they're distilling it down that's a great place to start for us to be able to think and to be reading in that space.\nBut also what evidence is around here, around us in terms of the things that we can capture? What are the stories that people are telling? What's going on in the podcast, you know there's a whole range of different sources of evidence and personally I think if we can just embrace the information that is around us it is a starting point because it starts to break down our fear of working with evidence and our fear.\nNC: I have to be honest with you I'm still struggling with this because you're all saying use evidence but you're still not taking me to that point where I can get my head around where you start gathering it from and how you start applying it, so Andy can you help me here?\nAL: Yeah I think Laura's touched on a really important point so I'm just going to emphasise something really important Laura said about curiosity, we often see in child development as a child goes through, you know the 'why' stage is really important and it's where you're gathering information which actually changes your thinking, your behaviour and I think that asking why is really important and I think Laura has touched a really crucial point about that we must be curious.\nLet's start through the process: I think one of the reasons we often fall down on this is we don't diagnose very well what the actual learning need is, if it's a learning need at all. So it's a practical thing on this one, often we end up our default position is we think there's going to be a learning outcome and we fail to recognise that the actual performance need is based in a real ecosystem, it's a systemic thing that's going on. So we sometimes over-simplify even what we're trying to do here. So if you want to look for evidence I think diagnosis is really, really important. We know the thing if we go to the doctor's we expect the doctor to do a good diagnosis based on evidence as to what the outcome might be needed here.\nSo I think a starting place Nigel is we've got to start diagnosing really well as to what the default issue, the default opportunity we have. And I think that comes right back to Laura's point about curiosity, asking interesting and difficult and probing questions about what we're even trying to do, is the first place where we start finding evidence.\nNC: Okay in that case Owen Ferguson can you give me an example perhaps from your own experience of a situation where starting to use evidence has improved outcomes, in a business, perhaps improved talent management or just something that's important to the learning and development process?\nOF: I can talk to my own personal context here, so one of the things that the company does we make products that aim to be used within organisations and there are certain expected outcomes from those products being used. And so the first thing we ask ourselves is what problem are we trying to solve or what change is being required? How will we know when that has happened? And what metrics are already in place for us to measure the effectiveness of that change? And from that starting point you work your way back. And so we do lots of things like we run AB tests, so rather than just design one platonic ideal of a solution we'll design multiple solutions then we'll deploy them and we'll figure out which one is working best, based on the metrics, the performance outcomes, or the evaluation metrics that we've put in place.\nAnd so I guess, as Andy was mentioning, starting with the end of mind is it's critical in order for you to be able to put something in place that actually has the impact that you're intending, but if someone's looking for a cookie cutter approach that can be used in every situation, in every single organisation, that's not being evidence led because you need to take evidence from your local context, you need to critically evaluate whatever research evidence is available for the problem that you are solving as opposed to just adopting approaches that have been taken on by other organisations and expecting it explicitly to work within your own.\nNC: Laura I know you've been talking about work you've done in the past in retail.\nLO: Yes there was one example of using evidence in a big retail organisation that we were working with where we actually went out to the staff in those organisations, at all levels, from directors, through line managers, through the people onto the shop floor and we used questions to ask them to reflect on how they currently learnt what they needed to do their job. So a very similar kind of research programme I think Owen that you've done as well with leaders as well. But just getting people to reflect.\nAnd that surfaced all kinds of different insights into how people were doing their job and how people were learning how they were doing their job. And yet when their line managers came to the learning and development team saying, 'I would like a course, I would like you to put everybody on a course, everyone on a programme,' the learning and development team were able to take this learning landscape work and say, 'Actually here is a picture of how your team say they learn best, are you sure you want me to go to number five, or should we perhaps use this as an opportunity to try something new?'\nNow I'm not suggesting that just because their team said, 'I normally learn in this way,' that that is the reason for you to change everything. No it's going back exactly Owen to what you said, you've got to use multiple sources of information and evidence in order to make the best decision about how you meet that need. But just having one source of evidence from that context allows you to kind of challenge the current status quo and say, maybe it's time to use a different type of learning intervention in order to drive performance and that's when you then are able to use evidence to bring other sources of evidence-informed decisions about design.\nNC: Yeah I mean it will be interesting to see what Andy says about that. It's almost as if some leaders in organisations have pretty traditional ideas about learning and development and it's actually they're the people that the L&D types have got to challenge sometimes.\nAL: Yeah I think without doubt our own research, we did a report called Professionalising Learning and Development which actually called out an uncomfortable truth that often one of the biggest blockers is the mindset of senior leaders, that's a tough one to call out. But often what we think is defective is based on the shape we've had ourselves. So if we've been through a particular learning experience then often we think that's the way other people should learn. So Laura's absolutely right I think dialogue is really important in this one, and asking questions.\nSo I think it's important to think about where we find it. In terms of the data question, we're rich in data now, in fact probably we have too much data in organisations. So I think one of the skills is understanding what data we use but particularly if you think about designing learning data lurks in customer services, it lurks in feedback and complaints, it lurks in HR systems, recruitment systems, performance systems, finance systems. So I think the issue is not that there isn't the data on which we can make these decisions, I think the challenge is finding the right data. And I think for me one of the skills we now need as learning and HR professionals is to build really good stakeholder relationships because a lot of this evidence based practice relies on other people in the learning ecosystem being part of the solution here and often we've been so locked into our own departments that we haven't gone out there.\nSo I think Laura's example from retail is absolutely spot on that we've got to get out there and make these connections. And to Owen's point you've got to ask the right question, you've got to have a hypothesis, what are we trying to solve here and then we can garner all manner of great insights, both quantitative and qualitative in terms of supporting how we best design and deploy learning.\nLO: I think that's such an important point because when two minds come together then there's overlap as well and there's kind of a real excitement in the overlap. And Owen I just remember working with you on some of the data and you approached the data that I was looking at from a completely different mindset and out of that it was just a fantastic learning experience for me because I was able to see things in what I was looking at, I'd been looking at day on day out, because you had a different approach Owen, then that kind of released a new life, a new insight into that. And so I think that collaboration and connection can really help us as learning professionals. It's not just down to ourselves, we've got great people around us who are as equally passionate about surfacing insights and solving business problems and we should pool resources. And I mean Owen I don't know what you think about that but I just felt as we were talking about that it just reminded me of working with you and you challenged me and I really, really valued a different perspective on that and it gave me more insight.\nOF: Absolutely and the experience was reciprocal and I think actually that's interrogating the questions that you're actually trying to ask and getting different perspectives, it's all part of that evidence based approach, rather than just making assumptions or not opening yourself up to feedback or challenge. So it comes back to one of the things that we said earlier, fundamentally it comes down to curiosity and a willingness to get better.\nNC: How do we upskill people because we saw, I mentioned those statistics at the beginning the lack of ability or confidence people have in handling this data?\nOF: I think getting more data savvy is important and there are plenty of ways of doing it, we are learning professionals so we should be able to figure out a way of putting ourselves onto a development path for that but let's not forget there are plenty of data savvy people within the organisations that we work in, they can help us to interrogate the data. So my advice would be to expand out, during those very early stages when you're trying to figure out what's the actual problem that we're trying to solve here, how would we know that we would be successful, what data do we currently have, is to step outside the function and start speaking to some of the other areas that might be able to provide some of that insight, because you don't have to do the calculations yourself, there are people there that can help you to get there.\nLO: I'd like to give an example of that because I was chairing, when we were allowed to chair at live events, a CIPD event last year, and Seb Tindall was there from the Vitality Group and I know that there's a story about what Seb's been doing on the CIPD site, but what I loved about Seb's story is he moved his learning and development department and sat them next door to the data analytics department and so the teams were seated physically side by side and just picking up each other's challenges and working out how to do that. And I just thought, God what a simple idea! Just get close to people, physically is even better.\nNC: I can see Andy in this post-COVID era that would still be quite difficult but not impossible maybe?\nAL: I think Laura makes a brilliant point there, it just triggered off the thinking, which is why it's so cool to hang around in these kind of settings. The Medici in the Renaissance, they hung around in a very diverse group. You look at that and is it John Donne says, 'No man (or woman) is an island,' and I think there's a real danger that professionally we get very isolated and I think, to Laura's point is it is about positioning and interfacing with other professionals. And the Medici was fascinating, you know you've got philosophers and writers and painters and all manner of people and together they were able to be far more creative and have a greater impact because of that diversity.\nFor me, Owen and Laura, I think one of the challenges we have is that our own professional development's very limited and things are moving fast and we think the world of learning it's not only data which is crucial but when you think about technology, when you think about cognitive science, there are many areas which the Venn diagram overlap with learning and I think our challenge but also our opportunity is to hang around other professional communities because that's where we understand not only about data but we understand about how these other areas, how practice is moving on and changing. And those things have a direct impact on how we design. So for instance technology it's no good to say, I'm not particularly interested in technology.\nNC: So Owen how do we do that because of the way we're working at the moment because clearly it is much more difficult to get that interplay isn't it?\nOF: Well it is and it isn't. My experience is people are more than happy to share if you reach out to them. So whilst it's not necessarily possible for someone in L&D to physically go and attend a marketing conference, and I would hold up marketing as a professional domain that has possibly made that transition, or is starting to make that transition into being much more evidence led, slightly earlier than we have perhaps, so you can't physically go and attend a conference and mingle with people there but all the conferences are virtual now and people who work in marketing functions and marketing functions that are trying to become much more data led, are more than happy to talk about their experience if you reach out to them. People are passionate about what they do. They will talk to you.\nI went through an exercise a number of years ago when I spoke to a group of digital leaders in very different spaces to the one that I was working in because I was looking at revamping how we did stuff and all that I needed to do was to drop them a LinkedIn message or drop them an email and the vast majority, 90% plus, people came back and said, 'I can spare an hour to have a chat.'\nNC: And Laura is there any danger that L&D people are going to be a bit side-lined in the business if they don't act a bit faster on this evidence thing because evidence based practice is just so common in every other part of business isn't it?\nLO: Yeah I think there is a sense that if we don't start talking about what's important to business and ask smart questions that allow us to be more valuable in that business field we will be side-lined. If we only talk about data that is relevant to how many people have engaged, how many happy sheets have been collected, you know or how many moments people have spent in videos and learning related data that our systems churn out that as business is moving along so quickly at the moment then we're really in danger of completely thinking we're on the right bandwagon and we're talking data and analytics but we're looking at it only through our narrow lens. So there's a real danger that we could be side-lined there.\nBut also Nigel there's a danger that we could be side-lined when we're not able, to address what Andy and Owen were saying earlier about the critical reason we are here is to get people ready for change, for performance, for productivity. And if we haven't got evidence about the best way of doing that, whether or not we're on track, what might be getting in the way in terms of systems, then we're not going to be able to smooth that process. We're not going to have the smart conversations that are needed in the system of organisation and in the way that the organisation is managed. So we need that to challenge ourselves, challenge our design and challenge others in order to bring that value that is so essential from our profession.\nAL: Yeah and Laura I think that's absolutely right and I would slightly challenge the question Nigel that you've asked there because it's easy to spin this in the negative, you know if we don't do this then do we become a defunct function within organisations? Do leaders say we don't need learning professionals or we'll outsource this? How about twisting that around completely on its face and say, if we are driven by great evidence-based we are able to go to organisations and say, if you invest in this initiative, or you invest in this, then we will show a positive outcome.\nAnd I think so often working with learning professionals we know the issue on this, so the issue is not to be negative about this but to get this into a positive place where we can say we are confident that the way we design learning, the methods we use, the technology we use, the approach we use, the data we use, brings such a positive outcome. So I think let's not down ourselves on here but recognise there's a massive opportunity here to add value to organisations and that's where we should be.\nNC: I stand corrected, too many years as a journalist clearly. We're almost reaching the end of our time here, I wanted to try and draw some conclusions to go round to each of you. So if we just start with Owen just some kind of top tips to finish really to set people on the right path, just gathering more evidence and using it more intelligently.\nOF: I think my main tip would be to learn from how other professional domains have made or have started to make the transition.\nNC: Well like your marketing thing?\nOF: Like the marketing thing exactly, but actually the clinical example is medicine and you can get a delightful primer on that through Ben Goldacre's book Bad Science but there is a lot of stuff out there. For anyone thinking that medicine's got a much longer track record and importance in learning and development I'd highlight two things: the first is that the drive towards evidence based practice only took hold in medicine from the 1970s onwards and the second is that our ambitions should be that high because as we've just been discussing we play a critical role in enabling the organisation to enact its strategy, all we're saying is by taking an evidence based approach you're providing more certainty that our activities will have a positive impact on performance.\nSo what can we learn from how other professional domains have done that? But start small, it doesn't have to be on the biggest, most strategic, costly initiatives, start small and start trying out some of the techniques that other professional domains have found to be successful.\nLO: I think for me I love that because starting small is about building courage, you know building your courage, building your confidence, and that is so good. And I think my tip would be avoid the analysis paralysis, you know we can suddenly think, I've got to be more evidence informed, I need to read every study about cognitive science, I need to look at every piece of data, I need to find causation and correlation, because I need to define causation and correlation, there is so much that comes at us with the jargon that we can be paralysed in this new world of work.\nSo stop analysis paralysis and I love the work that Rob Bryan has been doing with the CIPD in the past about evidence based decisions. And they say get your evidence, as much as you can, from as many sources as you can but just enough to help you make that decision. So you don't have to know everything about everything but look at multiple sources of evidence to help you inform your decision. Focus on action. Don't focus on just pure analysis. So that would be my tip.\nNC: And Andy Lancaster there's a lot of CIPD resources online, I know you've been involved in quite a bit of that, anything in particular you point to, to set people on the right path?\nAL: I think there's one little stick step process which I find really useful which is all around being grounded in evidence based practice, six As: Asking, really translating a practical issue or a problem into a question, which is that whole kind of hypothesis; Acquiring, systematically searching for the evidence; Appraising, critically judging the trustworthiness and relevance of evidence; Aggregating, weighing and pulling together evidence; Applying, then incorporating that evidence into decision making; and finally Assessing, evaluating the outcome of the decision. So it's a neat little six As but I kind of have that by the side of my desk as a check that we're going to do this in a really good way and I'd say as well as that Nigel just hang around with good people who are really passionate about this, which is why it's great to have had Owen and Laura in this session here. Let's get alongside great people who are passionate about this.\nNC: Well it's been great to hang around with such good people. Thank you one and all Laura Overton, Owen Ferguson and Andy Lancaster who I think between them made a pretty overwhelming case for the value of evidence as a tool to improve learning, nurture talent and help people become fitter for the business in hand.\nBy the way if you are looking for more suggestions on how to work smarter in L&D and HR in these times don't forget to subscribe to the CIPD podcast so you don't miss an edition, that's anywhere you usually get your podcasts. Last time, for example, we heard about the benefits of taking a few more calculated risks with your people. We had a lot of positive reaction to that one on social media: Fantastic podcast, really good. And another: About time HR had a shake-up. So do go back and see what you can catch up on from recent editions.\nUntil next time from me Nigel Cassidy and all of us here at the CIPD it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

We are seeing seismic shifts in the world of work, not just in what our physical workplace looks like, but in what our expectations of work are. But is the people profession – so frequently labelled ‘risk-averse’ – ready to step up, release the handbrake and seize the opportunity to drive organisations forward and make progress where it’s needed?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, Yetunde Hofmann, Managing Director at Synchrony Development Consulting, Caroline Parsons, HR Director and Director of Shared Services at WSP Middle East, and Geoff Trickey, Managing Director at PCL, as we explore how people practitioners can take well-calculated risks and seize opportunities.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:33:11\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: People who manage people are usually cautious; they follow rules and avoid risks but could this approach be holding businesses back? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWe could have started with a burst of Freddie Mercury singing I Want to Break Free. Yet do we want to break free really? In this still very uncertain working world people professionals can too easily take comfort in daily structure, yes always busy holding things together, writing and implementing policies and policing it all. But if there's no reward without risk then what is your organisation missing out on here? To help us find out CIPD board member Yetunde Hofmann, who built a stellar HR career at FTSE 100 companies, she's MD of Synchrony Development Consulting and famously gave a TEDX Talk, Why Not Have Love in Business? Hello.\nYetunde Hofmann: Hi Nigel thank you.\nNC: Caroline Parsons leads over 170 people as HR Director for WSP in Dubai in the Middle East; WSP provides management and services for clients in the built and natural environments. Among other things she's going to tell us how she stopped writing policies. Hello.\nCaroline Parsons: Hi Nigel.\nNC: But maybe it's not just the policies but our own personal risk appetites which might be getting in the way so also with us chartered psychologist Geoff Trickey, the MD of PCL, an expert assessor and consultancy in all things employee engagement, selection and career development. Hello.\nGeoff Trickey: Hello, hello Nigel.\nNC: So Caroline Parsons before you kind of drop your no policies bomb on us can you just delve back a little bit into your professional training, your initial working life as a people manager in Manchester I think it was? In what way would you say that compliance, the rule book of policies, not only maybe filled your time but maybe even influenced how you worked with people and treated them?\nCP: Well I'm trained in HR so the moment I went into HR as a profession, my degree is in HR, I studied advanced law with the CIPD as soon as I graduated and my early career was spent working in unionised environments, so my internships and my early graduate career were with Corus, formerly British Steel, very unionised, an environment where you did have to have policies and rules because people were watching for that. It was also at a time, and you'll guess my age when I say this, but it was when data protection became a big topic and I was a data protection compliance officer very, very early in my career. It was also around the time when Sarbanes Oxley became relevant, so it was all about audit, rules, trade union agreements, following what we said we would do, being held accountable for what we said we'd do. So it was quite an interesting beginning of my career, which certainly put that into my DNA and being in the UK as well just the legislative framework, the policy culture we were in. So I'd say from day one I was immersed into compliance from lots of different angles.\nNC: So you were a policewoman almost.\nCP: I was and people used to say that and I didn't ever like that but that was kind of, even from the very beginning that was what we were positioned as, and especially in those environments. So after Corus I went to Balfour Beatty, again highly unionised environment, big textbook trade agreements that we had to follow, you know we weren't given wriggle room I guess to go outside of what we'd agreed with the unions.\nNC: And Yetunde Hofmann this must be all pretty familiar to you, I mean in your time you must have helped create complex handbooks for companies and everything and after all part of the job is keeping your firm out of the headlines to make sure people don't get the company into trouble?\nYH: Nigel you're absolutely right and if you're working in the controversial industry which I did in my last executive career I was head of people integration for a global merger of imperial brands with Altadis which was basically Seita of France and Tabacalera of Spain. This was a global company but 17,000 acquired 45,000 people. And so how do you integrate? We had to have a rule book, we were dealing with works councils across all of Europe, just like Caroline said, you had to stay in line and you had also local country employment law to adhere to and making sure that people are selected well and so you just had to work within the box that was given to you and very little wriggle room.\nNC: And Geoff Trickey on top of this of course we all have our own personal kind of risk appetites don't we?\nGT: We do indeed. Since I suppose the last ten years we've been researching that specifically and that was brought to the forefront by the regulatory response I suppose to the financial crisis and part of that was that financial intermediaries must always take into account the risk disposition of their clients. And of course there really wasn't a way of doing that that was really reflected psychology. There were a lot of simplistic questionnaires that were reeled out but there wasn't anything well-researched. And so I guess the last ten years we've been working on that and developing a methodology to help identify what we described as risk type, but it's not actually a typology, it's continuous but you need to divide it up just in order to attach meaning to the various points along that continuum, if you see what I mean. So we developed something called the Risk Type Compass. And that's proved to be really quite fascinating.\nNC: Are you actually able to say that when people are disposed towards rules and they personally say that they're a good idea that they might be, I don't know, overzealous or somehow they will have a kind of safety first approach which might not necessarily be the best way to do their job?\nGT: Yeah I think that's the case. I think the point is some people need rules, they desperately want the rules and they'll ask for the rules if you haven't got any. They like things to be specific and coherent and clear and also they need to feel they have permission to do what they want to do. So that's I suppose in a way your ideal corporate sort of faceless person. I mean the reality is that there are a lot of people who don't ask permission and I mean that's your entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs don't go around saying, 'Can I do this, can I do that?' they do it and wait for someone to say, 'Well what are you doing? You're violating this rule.' And it's, 'Oh sorry I'll fix that.' And so this all sort of occurred to me as a young person living around the green lanes in north London where waves of immigrants would come up, open up a shop or a club, or a bar or a bakery and get on with it and then wait for the local authority to come and say, 'Oh excuse me have you got a license for this?' you know that sort of exemplified to me the difference between those who want to have permission and those who don't.\nYH: When it comes to the world of HR and organisation it's similar to boards, there will be an element of compliance that you've got to adhere to because governments across the nations globally will have employment law and it will be responsible and indeed its leadership that the HR leader, the HR professional adheres to that. But then it depends on personalities, listening to Geoff because you may have the HR director who just will stick completely, or the HR manager, business partner, will stick completely to the plan, to the policy, and then you may have the person who's more open to being entrepreneurial, wanting to do different things and says, okay let's meet the minimum requirements here and then let's get creative. So it depends on the individual.\nCP: Two points I think one I work in an engineering firm so those people that want clarity exist but it's also a professional services firm so there's the entrepreneurial spirit. So trying to balance that has been what has been my freedom over the last years because people didn't all want the rules that Geoff described but because we were entrepreneurial at the same time, but engineers do in the end, they want some clarity. So that's driven a little bit of how we responded and just to also pick up on Yetunde's points around, you know HR directors responsibility to be compliant but the thing that I've noticed in the years since I kind of stopped writing policies more or less was I found that the better HR directors or HR leaders were way more creative, way more creative, more curious, they were prepared to work within boundaries but push them a little bit and find solutions that were more suitable to what people needed.\nNC: So Caroline you decided that you were going to stop writing policies, you were going to, wherever possible, throw away the rule book, so just tell us first what kind of reaction did you get from senior managers, from colleagues and then how did it work out?\nCP: So I think what led us to that point is an important point. So we were doing a merger and it was two companies, equal sized, both very reputable, and you were sitting looking at two sets of policies, looking at how do I integrate and it wasn't a choice of one or the other it was well maybe there's a third alternative and in that moment I set out with the two teams, the two HR teams, and said, 'Okay you go away and write that policy again, you go away and find the best of that one,' and what they came back with was maybe shorter versions of the same thing. And then I just really started to think about the facts, why are we doing this? You know this was a moment that you don't often get in organisations where you can rewrite the whole thing. And so we looked at it and said, 'Well what does high trust mean?' we were an organisation trying to be, and managed to be successful in the Great Place to Work Index, and that was all about trust. And we said, 'Well does this policy sound like it trusts somebody?' So when we started to ask that question we came up with different outcomes, we stopped thinking about why do we need a policy at all, we need to design it in the process, which is what Yetunde was saying is if you design it into the process then you don't need so much of an employee handbook or a set of rules somewhere that people can go and look at when you want to attack them with it or defend yourself with it.\nNC: Are we talking about rules for what here?\nCP: For process, you know how do you manage sick leave, how do you manage disability claims, harassment, how do you manage any part of the life cycle, on-boarding, off-boarding, anything that is process-driven and requires guidance we found you could often design it into the process. So it isn't that guidance doesn't exist it's that the handbooks and the pages and pages of, this is the policy and this is the eligibility and this is the criteria and this is how it's enforced, you don't need those. And your question was how have managers responded? Nobody came and asked me for a policy and it's been about seven years now.\nNC: That's extraordinary. This is the kind of business world that we're moving into now which is much looser and I'm just wondering whether there are any tactics, any assessment, any things that you can do that make it slightly easier to ease both managers and people who work for them into this kind of environment?\nGT: I think there's a kind of natural phenomenon here isn't there, I mean take it on Caroline's point about really a moment of disruption and chaos, times of disruption are perfect for introducing new policies aren't they? And I know, I mean just as a result of COVID there are many organisations that will never go back to what they were before and when we've been talking about a new normal, I think there will be a new normal, people will take advantage of the disruption to take the opportunity to take over a piece of territory or to do things differently or to get another point of view across. I think the other point I would make is that it is about diversity, I don't think it's about having, I mean the last thing you want is people who all agree with each other. So you can create your own disruption in a way but within the board. If you've got a board which is all of one mind and looks at everything the same way then you've got instant groupthink, I mean that's not a good thing. So a lot of the work we've been doing with boards is to first of all build self-awareness so let people recognise that that person has a different point of view and that's a point of contention at the moment but if you can recognise it, and another word that Caroline's used a lot is trust, if you work in a climate of mutual trust then you respect that other point of view and that becomes a strength. So yeah my general point was that having a variety of viewpoint is what you want, you don't want either entrepreneurs or you want rule players you want both. And you want a climate, I mean it's the risk culture needs to be not something highly specific but something that is broader and looser so that people feel free, they feel that they have the permission to make their contribution. I mean the worse thing you want is where you've got a lot of people that think the same and the person who really has the answer is the person who's outnumbered, but they have the answer and they're reticent about disturbing this consensus. So I think there's a way of working together and I mentioned disruption, I mean we know that disruptive points, commercially or whatever in our world are the times when things change. It's when we have a completely new view of shopping because Amazon comes along or whatever, hi-tech have obviously been the main players just recently. But that's just history. I think whenever there's disruption there's opportunity. But I would stress this point about divergence and complementary views and having that sort of solid basis for decision making is always better than one autocratic view.\nNC: We're talking essentially here about learning to take more calculated risks with people so I'd like Yetunde Hofmann maybe to go through some of the things because like Caroline you were in very much command and control situations in the early part of your career, so can you just talk us through some of the areas in your practice where taking the brakes off and thinking carefully and then doing something which might appear a bit risky can bring rewards?\nYH: Well I think that one of the things that you've got to be aware of, any HR person living out there, is that you've got to really understand the people that you are working with, who you support, and you've got to have an attitude of people first, what are we trying to achieve, and how will it impact the people I'm working with? So I come from a school of saying we've got to have freedom with discipline because people do want psychological safety in the way they operate, and as an HR leader, all HR leaders out there have responsibility because it's a leadership profession, it's a leadership function. And so the first thing starts with trusting yourself and belief in yourself, in the leader, believing in yourself as the leader you are called to be, to serve, to lead, to step forward. And this can show up in all kinds of instances whether you're around a table at a talent review meeting, you've got all your boxes, the nine-box matrix etc. and there's somebody who absolutely is a shining star and that person is not being recognised as such because maybe the rule of the day in the organisation is all about strategy and this person's very operational, high performing operational, then it's up to the HR leader or the HR professional in the room to stand up and be counted. And I've seen situations where that risk has been taken because the HR leader has established some trust, has been willing to say, 'I personally back this person,' and that individual has soared. And therefore you cannot go by the rulebooks all the time. I've seen this time and time again. I've seen it in my role in Unilever, I've seen it in my role in Northern Foods, I've seen it in my role in Domecq. So it's so important the HR leader his or herself having a belief in what their role is about to be, having a high level of self-awareness or making sure they develop that. And then because they know what they're there to do, not climb up the greasy poles of power, they're there to serve, to make a difference, if that's backing them then they're more willing to stick their neck out, round the talent review table, round the promotion boards if you're in a partnership, round the recruitment and selection boards if you're in graduate recruitment, whatever it might be.\nNC: Yetunde is talking about a kind of life's experience which she's inspiring people to put into their practice but what about people who are maybe just not quite so far up the career ladder, this kind approach to work is maybe a little bit more difficult so just talk a bit about how you inspire you're people to kind of, if not break the rules then certainly work out how they maybe don't need them?\nCP: I definitely can say I've experienced that, so where you give, even you say, 'Go away and rewrite it, think about trust, does it feel like it trusts you?' and a team would still come back with a version that maybe has less words but it's still got the control in there, you know they may take out some of it but they still hold on to a bit, and it takes a lot of time, it takes coaching. But it does take leadership to that point, it does take to have a leader who's prepared to resist the organisation's urge for policy for example, or resist the organisation's urge to be black and white on matters that are absolutely grey. So I think leadership is key and making it a safe space to do that. As HR people, as I said, I try to grow this idea of creativity and freedom, so I often say, 'Well what do you think?' I'm very much of the school where it says, 'Okay well I think this is an idea we could go with but what do you think? How do you think this is going to work with the people that you work with and the people that you serve? Is this going to go well, is it going to cause issues for us?' so over the years I've spent time walking it through to reach a solution but often I've found giving people freedom to go away and set the parameter of I want high trust, low process, what does that look like? And then they come back and then I kind of say, 'Well do we really need that bit and that bit? Does that say it's low trust?' So just coaching but it does need leadership I have to say. You have to have an organisational climate where this is permitted or encouraged even, that curiosity and that creativity.\nNC: Geoff Trickey what about situations, we've already had hints of this, where people actually need more structure, that they would feel slightly discomforted by not knowing what the structure is?\nGT: Well I think that accounts for quite a lot of people, and particularly in certain professions, where that is kind of the situation. I think different professions attract different people, so you don't have the same cross section of people, for example working as air traffic controllers as you do working in advertising or marketing or something. I mean they get attracted differently and that kind of establishes a culture I suppose.\nNC: So Geoff what kind of people are HR managers then?\nGT: Well I'm interested in this. We had a look at our data and we have a lot of data and all our data is anonymised but we do retain what their background is and I was surprised, we didn't have a huge number of people who identify as HR but they seemed surprisingly to me, varied. I mean we break up the spectrum and it is a 360 degree spectrum and we break that up into a number of different parts, there's eight different risk types basically. And if you're talking about air traffic controllers for example about 99% of them come from the same quadrant within the compass. HR are fairly evenly distributed around. And this is reflecting people in all sorts of different positions in HR, so you can't draw much on it.\nNC: I'll just stop you there a second. Yetunde are you surprised at that because I would have thought that a lot of people who are attracted to HR would be relatively risk averse, they're not probably entrepreneurs, they're not bold people who want to do something different every day and then not clean up the mess.\nYH: Nigel I believe without a shadow of a doubt and when I talk about HR being a leadership profession I mean at all levels, it's a profession as a leadership one, so it's not just about the career ladder. But coming back to what you said about the people who are attracted to HR I believe, without a shadow of a doubt if more HR professionals believed in their own capabilities and what they were there to do many more of them would be transitioning into CEO roles, because I believe the HR profession in organisations deals from the ridiculous to the sublime. It deals with detail, process, strategy, creativity, the finance and every aspect of the organisation. And so I often believe that HR directors, HR professionals are really close at CEOs and if they had somebody backing them and saying, 'I believe in you,' indeed if they backed themselves more we'd see  more HR people going for general management roles. And they would be fantastic.\nNC: Caroline this is a pretty revolutionary idea isn't it?\nCP: Not really I was on a career track for CEO, it's totally legit. I think who does the CEO call when he has a really big problem? It's usually the HR person first, certainly that's my experience.\nNC: In which case then why is the image of the profession behind the curve because it's almost like, I mean you're all talking about a very different kind of modern HR and yet we're talking about the sort of stereotype of people just policing rules.\nCP: I am sometimes disappointed with HR practitioners that I meet who perhaps haven't had the luxury that I've had or not had opportunity to look at it differently, because I came from that same route and I was going on that same route and I now find myself throwing away work that I would have years ago found sacred, that I needed, and I don't need it anymore. So I think it's often the opportunities and experiences had, in the Middle East particularly we don't see as many of the kind of creative visionary HR leaders as I describe, they are here but there's not as many of them. So they're definitely here. So I think there is a general shift in the profession but it's taking some time and I have to say, going back to Geoff's point about what kind of people come into HR, I do think they are a little risk averse. I'm a little risk averse, you know I've had to come out of my comfort zone to be the person I am today, to be the leader I am today but for sure in general life I would be nervous of risk so I am exactly the stereotype of risk averse, you know I like to have some rules but I like to know what I can do inside them.\nNC: So Geoff can you work on yourself to do better in that area, to understand better what your natural tendencies are and to play against type maybe sometimes?\nGT: I think that's just about what growing up is, isn't it really/ you start off as a kid who has tantrums at the counter in the supermarket because you want a sweetie, and you nail that all down as you progress through the organisation because you know you mustn't have tantrums as a newly employed graduate. By the time you become the CEO you don't care anymore. I mean you get people who are incredibly self-indulgent at the top of organisations and it's a sort of a coaching theme I guess that we deploy a lot which we refer to as the dark side of personality. Personality is fundamentally a part of your nature really, that part of it, but then you've got a cognitive side of you which is trying to wrestle with that and present to the world whatever is going to work. So there's always this sort of struggle between what is your nature and what you desire to be. And the problem is, I mean CEOs these days and on a global sort of basis, don't last long. I mean the likelihood is they'll change after three years, four years in big organisations. And that's largely because they lose the faith of the people they work with, they lose the trust of the people they work with because they become, I suppose, well it depends I mean the dark side of personality is a big subject so I can't just boil it down to arrogance but hubris is something that comes to the fore and is often discussed. That's one aspect of this where what would have been restrained in the younger newly appointed person who does everything they're told to begin with as they rise through the organisation they allow themselves to be, you know who's going to tell me what to do, look where I sit in the world, I'm right up here, you know. That is a massive over-simplification, don't take that too literally but it's a good example because we all know about confidence and over-confidence and hubris. And it's one of the tracks, there's about 12 tracks like this that you can identify within the dark side of personality, they are derailers basically in the end. What is your basic strength turns out to be what derails you in the end if you let it get away from you.\nNC: It sounds a bit like politics, all careers end in failure. Well stay in HR that's the answer isn't it? Yetunde Hofmann as we try and start to draw this to a close can you just give us a tip or two, just give us a couple of ideas for making sure that you're being more creative in this work and not just avoiding everything because there might be a risk involved?\nYH: Well there's an expression I would use, physician heal thyself. And to heal yourself you've really got to understand who you are. So the very first tip is that an HR leader, and we all are leaders it doesn't matter what level you are in the HR function in your organisation, invest time in understanding yourself and invest time in accepting all of who you are. This is what I call love in an organisation you've really got to operate from a place of love. And then from there you've got to understand your boundaries and if you want to take some risk go to colleagues that can help you, surround yourself with people who can support you, people from the frontline, who buy into what you're trying to do. Test your ideas on a few things and situations. I talk about bringing love in organisations and people have said, well how do you do that? Well like with any change programme to take some risk try, test with one or two trusted people and then from there you can create the butterfly effect across the organisation. And I tell you something CEOs are very risk averse, if we had more leaders, traditional leaders, as in CEOs, top level people in organisations taking more risk we wouldn't have the diversity problem we have now in business across the world because people like to be safe, they want people that look like them, sound like them, feel like them, at the top. So if we had more creative thinking in the gatekeeping positions we'd have more colour, more thought leadership, more neurodiversity, more gender, all of that, the richness would be in organisations. So I think that that's the place to start. Start with understanding yourself. Here's a tip, be clear on that, do some personality tests, create a journal, seek feedback and then if you have a germ of an idea find one or two stakeholders in your organisation who are willing to support you and back you.\nNC: Wow, well follow that Caroline. In terms of your own practice anything you would add?\nCP: Wonderful contribution I just love everything you just said there. It's even inspiring for me as well. I think one thing that occurred to me then as well was just this abundance idea that there is enough ideas, there is enough time, there is enough creativity to go around, so to the point of trying things out is a great idea. So having an idea and saying, 'Well what's this organisation about, how do I really speak to the guiding principles or the mission or values of an organisation when I'm drafting the HR way of working or when I'm designing the employee experience?' I think if you profess to be an organisation that is high on trust or values empowerment then you have to go back and say, 'Well did I design that in?' because often we haven't done that. We've created a whole set of vision and values and then the design of the organisation does not complement that at all. So my advice to any HR practitioner is just go away and read back over the things that you're doing and the policies you've written and some of your core processes and just ask yourself is that doing what we're designing here? Because sometimes we haven't looked at it in that mirror for a while. We haven't thought deeply enough about what we've designed. So that's my tip. And some of my better ideas and some of our teams and organisational progression has been coming from really unravelling the detail of why we do what we do.\nNC: And a final thought from you Geoff?\nGT: Well social defence theory is a theory that suggests we survive as a team, as a species and that's why we're so diverse and in terms of our temperaments we need the mix, no one person has it all, if they do they only have any of it in a very diluted form. So Mervyn King draws attention, you know the former governor of the Bank of England, has a concept of radical uncertainty and as we get more technological we will move into greater and greater radical uncertainty. That's to say we're driving with the rear view mirror which has less and less in it because it's all more recent. In the past if you think traditionally you looked in a rear view mirror that might have said gone back 100 years. Now if you look in your rear view mirror you're looking back probably months or a couple of years to the last revolutionary destructive technical innovation. So we do need to find a way to get back almost to the team work and that's the diversity of approaches that enabled us to survive and to be successful as a species. That's my view and I think it's going to become more the case as the world becomes less and less familiar to us, and it's happening extremely rapidly now already, we're changing the world at a huge rate. You don't have a rear view mirror any more that's a guidance and a help to where you're going in the future. So that's radical uncertainty, better to make decisions from a diverse background of people, a diverse set of different dispositions, particularly in terms of risk because risk dispositions affect all your decisions, every decision is a risk decision if you think about it and your risk disposition is at the core of your personality. So that diversity needs to be there. That's my view of it.\nYH: I just wanted to give, on top of what Geoff said, a practical tip to any HR practitioner out there, when you're in a meeting two things, any meeting at all whether it's about talent reviews, whether it's recruitment, forming a policy etc. etc. two questions you could ask yourself, the first question should be who should be in this room that we haven't considered? That's creative because you might think of somebody, maybe somebody on the shop floor, it might be somebody on an engineering line, whatever it might be, because diversity is really also thinking who is this going to impact? That's the first question. Question two you could then ask is, who is going to be impacted by this decision that we're making, positively, negatively? And see whether that changes your decision or the process or whatever. I think those two questions any HR person in the room when they ask that question of their stakeholders, whether they're your peers, more junior, more senior, I think it would lead to some very constructive discussion and could bring some creativity and innovation out as well.\nNC: Great well some excellently constructive discussion from you all. Let me just thank our guests, Caroline Parsons in Dubai, Yetunde Hofmann and Geoff Trickey, great stuff one and all.\nTalking as we were just now about this new working world that COVID has rained on us we had a great and very positive reaction to our last podcast, Severn Trent's Neil Morrison, Compass Group's Deborah Taylor [sic] and the CIPD's Brad Taylor, walked us through how 2021 is set to change so much else in HR. So do have a listen if you haven't caught that first show of the year and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts so you don't miss any future editions.

Whether that was due to a sudden surge in demand for key services or having to adapt operations as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, no business remained unscathed. One thing that is abundantly clear is that our working lives will not be returning to ‘normal’. The pandemic presented an opportunity for employees to reconsider how they work and whether it’s conducive to work-life balance. But are organisations prepared to make the necessary changes that contribute towards building a braver, fairer and more equal world?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, Neil Morrison, Group HR Director at Severn Trent PLC, Deborah Lee, Group Engagement Director, Compass Group and Brad Taylor, Director of People at CIPD, as we take our first steps into 2021 and explore the key anticipated shifts in people practice as we recover and rebuild better and fairer organisations.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:31:16\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: From surviving to thriving, what will or ought to change in how we organise our working lives in 2021? Hello I'm Nigel Cassidy and welcome to the CIPD podcast.\nWell we've made it through surely the hardest year ever for people professionals, as one, maybe somewhat jaded human resources manager put it, dealing with all the awkward employee matters that managers were too scared to deal with. So what happens next? Well cards on the table, time to pick out the crucial areas of people practice that this month's crew think will be centre stage in the brave world of 2021.\nWith us firstly the Group Engagement Director of the food and hospitality group, Compass, her HR career spans BT and Yoox Net-A-Porter, I knew I should have dressed up for the first show of 2021, it's Deborah Lee. Hello.\nDeborah Lee: Hello. Lovely to be here.\nNC: We've the Director of Human Resources at Severn Trent with HR experience at several household name companies, he's also helped steer the global merger between Random House and Penguin, it's Neil Morrison, Group HR Director of Severn Trent, hello.\nNeil Morrison: Hi there.\nNC: And from the home team a people strategy person whose career takes in both HR and non-HR roles at Barclays and being workplace director of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants it's the CIPD's Director of People, Organisational Development of Workplace, Brad Taylor. Hello.\nBrad Taylor: Hello good to join you.\nNC: So Brad we start 2021 with a huge overhang don't we? I mean it's going to be more of the same with near deserted offices still, workers stuck at home, not well-equipped. So I mean is this unfinished business as far as people policy implications go or have we actually just learnt to live with all this?\nBT: I think it's something we've learnt rapidly to live with as we've gone through the year. I think it's taken us more quickly on a direction possibly that we were already heading in. There had been a lot of discussion about much more flexible working and how do we enable that, projects that seemingly would have taken years to get right and then all of a sudden we'd done it within a couple of weeks and we've been learning as we've been going along.\nSo I think where we are now is we have people who are working from home and after being set up with all the equipment and pieces that they need because a lot of people clearly weren't in a fit state to be set up for working from home, what we're now discovering is that in many ways their quite enjoying the flexibility that it's giving them. They're enjoying the greater sense of collaboration that the technology provides them with but it has been demanding along the way. We know from our own surveys that people are saying they would like to do a lot more of this type of working in the future, albeit with the option of being able to come into the office to collaborate and meet up with colleagues and have that sort of face-to-face interaction as well.\nNC: Well Deborah Lee I'm sure Compass has had to get to grips with all that, what are your thoughts about what continued support people professionals will need to give people, both practical and in terms of how their jobs are organised?\nDL: Well I think the first thing I would say is occasionally I hear colleagues say, 'When we get back to normal,' there's no getting back, I mean for sure the way in which we approach work and life I think is entirely different. We're used to working in different times, taking breaks during the day and operating in a completely different world. So I think it's about how are you equipping employees, managers and teams, the methods and skills and tools that will allow them to work in this new world. And that means also accommodating the fact that life and work are slightly blurred. The blurring of the lines I think is one of the ways to look at it but for sure we're not going back.\nThere is something very, very powerful in this as well that we need to remember which is we can never replace that face to face interaction and that personal building that we have, I mean we're naturally social creatures and whilst it's nice to be able to see people on screen it is also nice to be reassured that people have the rest of their body. So I think that's from a human behaviour point of view something that we need to also remember. How do you create those moments of connection alongside also providing flexibility and adaptability.\nNC: So Neil Morrison that does require quite a deep understanding just on the practical side of technology on the part of HR people who may not have been too concerned about it before?\nNM: I think it does but the first thing I'd like to say is we've got to remember that it's only about 40% of people who do work in the office, there are 60% of people who work in other environments as well, and so we are talking about a relatively small sub-section. If I look at our own organisation by far the majority of them have been working throughout this period of time in their normal working environments. And so one of the challenges for us as HR people is how we knit those different communities together and that's where, to your point, technology challenges do become quite difficult because if you've got employees in the field, if you've got some people in call centres, or if you've got them in treatment works, and others in offices or at home, actually creating a system that works for everyone in that sense is really quite tricky and difficult.\nNC: Are you actually changing how you design jobs because of this, because I guess it has led to changes in how people spend their time or where they spend their time?\nNM: So certainly for us we're not because what we're doing is changing how people do the things not what they do. And so as I say the vast majority of people are still doing the job in the same way, in the same place, going out into the communities and these are the key workers that we all went out on a Thursday night and clapped for. So we're not changing job design as such but we are thinking about how people organise work on a daily basis, so they're using their time in the offices, which are socially distanced, to do the work that requires you to be together, the sort of thing that Deborah was talking about, about how people need to come together in those situations and time at home to do the tasks that are better suited to be worked on individually.\nNC: So Brad and Deborah before we leave this have either of you any other thoughts to add on the practical functions of HR and how they might need to evolve in this year in order to accommodate these changes that started last year?\nDL: I think in terms of some of the things that we need to think differently about, if I take some pockets of some of our clients and certainly on the professional sides where the running assumption was people would come into the office, be there most of the time and take most of their benefits, the sort of fringe benefits that you would have, there. That needs to be looked at slightly differently. So I think the way in which we look at how do you attract and retain people given the changing expectations that they have in certain environments are required. So if you have an onsite gym or an onsite restaurant how do you provide those benefits for those working more flexibly in the future or a slightly different office layout. Is the office layout actually conducive to working in a way that allows people to have that flexibility where it's relevant? But I agree with Neil by the way on there are vast swathes of people who aren't in that environment and if HR are focusing all of their time and attention on these new ways of working actually you'll create more of a culture of us and them, the haves and the have nots, which would be a real travesty.\nOne of beautiful things I think that's happened in 2020, and there's not that many beautiful things, but one of the beautiful things is actually a lot of the jobs that my people here do have actually had a higher status than they've ever had before, people are really noticing, appreciating and understanding the importance of some of the roles that maybe were overlooked in the past or looked down on, and I think it's really important that we then take that moment and that ethos and continue to build the pride in those tasks, because they are so essential and so important. So I think that's been a nice thing that suddenly those roles have got an elevated status and I think that's the moment to grab of how do you maintain that.\nNC: Well it's interesting you say that about people's expectations about their jobs because Brad Taylor looking at the sort of things people professionals might need to consider in the next few months I'm a bit conflicted here because on the one hand we know joblessness is going to continue to rise and you would think a lot of people would be glad to hang onto their job, if they've still got one, and yet individuals have done a lot of thinking about what they might want out of life and I suppose the talent could walk if it isn't treated right?\nBT: Yes it's a really interesting situation really isn't it because the situation that we had last year has helped people have a serious rethink about what they expect and what they want to get out of their work and their work/life balance. So we have this scenario where on one hand people want to be able to hold onto jobs and fear for losing jobs and certainly furlough and things like that placed people in a lot of situations where they felt perhaps they didn't have control over their job and over their future, but as we emerge from this situation, and as the employers, the forward-thinking employers I think, will be thinking about what does this mean in terms of workplace design? How do we create work environments where people are able to work effectively from home but also be able to come into a workplace? And then what does the workplace actually provide for them? I think it's going to be moving on. It has been and it's going to be moving further from I come in, I sit at a desk or a workstation and I do my work to I want to go to a work environment because it provides a range of services or technology or facilities that I can't readily get from my home environment.\nNC: That all sounds a bit millennial Brad.\nBT: Thank you! Well I think this is. I think we have a generation of people who are more demanding of their employers, just like they are in anything in life, they know they can move on, they know they have greater flexibility. I think the challenge for employers will be if everyone's workplace is the same, because effectively it's your home, how do you differentiate yourself as an employer? What are the things that make you stand out amongst all the other employers to enable you to attract and retain the sort of talent that you want to be able to keep in the future?\nNC: And meanwhile Neil Morrison of course things in many ways may get worse before they get better, the wider economy is not good and unemployment is at record levels already, how do you think that will have an impact, well obviously some jobs will go but on the other side of that on hiring and recruiting, on how people manage their careers?\nNM: I think there's two things that are potentially likely to happen here. One is almost the opposite of what Brad is talking about is people who probably should be leaving will stay because maybe they're at a point in their career or a point in their time in the job where it would naturally be sensible for them to move on and do something else but because of the insecurity in the labour market they'll decide to stay. And so there's a real challenge in terms of HR professionals about how do you engage and motivate that population and make sure that they're still contributing as much as they can?\nAnd then the other thing that we see, and we always see this whenever we get a recession, is job applications start to increase for the number of roles that are there and what you find is people start to take more chances with jobs, so they'll be applying for things that they aren't necessarily a fit. And so there's a real challenge again for the profession about how do you handle those people ethically and sensibly, those people that are desperate for a job but maybe applying for something that they aren't necessarily suited for, or the pure volumes, without mechanisms such as closing jobs early because you've got enough applicants or resorting to some weird kind of algorithmic solution that just confines people to a successful or unsuccessful pile. So we have to wrestle with balancing the volume challenge with the ethical treatment and finding a way to manage both.\nNC: And of course the hospitality industry Deb has been hit incredibly hard so I guess you've had to do a lot of this management process already?\nDL: Well I think one of the key things is that it's remembering before you go into any of these is it's not the individual's fault that we're in this situation and they're good individuals who we want to maintain a good relationship for because it will come back, and we believe really strongly in that. So we were able to very quickly understand the areas that were closing like some of our sporting venues pieces and we had really great people really keen to help us and very dedicated but we had a real need in some of our other sectors such as healthcare and so forth and we were able to very quickly redeploy some of those people into that world.\nIt's forced us really to think how do we create that level of flexibility when the government's changing whether things are open or shut all the time and you have to be on the front foot because you required a different level of speed and pace and I think what it's done it's broken down and removed all the reasons why you wouldn't make those changes and become more agile and more flexible. And in that I think always keeping that dialogue open with our people and giving them the choice because for some individuals there wasn't really much of a choice because they had to be at home looking after their kids, there was no other alternative and how do we treat those people and look after them and maintain a really great relationship because it will come back and we do want all of our people to be ready and able to contribute as well.\nAnd I think one of the things that Neil mentioned around the algorithms that when you have so much volume and it does scare me too because when you want to build a real inclusivity into your business and you want to think about diverse pools you also want to be open to the fact that maybe someone has taken a chance but actually maybe this is the right move for them. So I think it gives as much opportunity as it does challenge and it's how do you keep both of those things in balance that you want people to be successful fundamentally and it might require us to think slightly differently about what we're doing to support people in that next phase.\nNC: Well yes and just continuing that theme with Brad Taylor we're going to see these divisions in our society continue aren't we? It seems unlikely they're going to be healed in the near future. So that of course raises all the questions about diversity programmes and initiatives, some of which sadly have been put on the back burner.\nBT: I think there was a kneejerk reaction last year when the pandemic struck for things like diversity inclusion initiatives to be put on the back burner. I think then employers quickly realised that that couldn't be sustained and there were a number of incidents that happened last year that demanded employers were treating those things seriously. But I think given where we are now this year and how we're thinking about talent, talent attraction, where we get our talent from, I think on one hand there's a greater opportunity for employers to seek much more diverse talent because effectively we can recruit further afield, we can target where we want to recruit so that we can bring much more diversity into the employment place, but there's a different set of challenges I think for HR in how it helps people manage the workplace interactions. So for example if you think about people with neuro-diverse issues or disabilities how does the employer safely look after those people and adapt the working practices to make sure that it's inclusive to that particular group of people.\nNC: So Neil Morrison some big questions for the whole human resource function as to how they should prioritise this area.\nNM: Yes and I think let's not forget that those people that have been most effected in terms of employment by the pandemic have predominantly been female, they've been from ethnic minorities and they've been the young, because they tend to disproportionately be employed in those industries that have been most effected by the pandemic and so again it's one of the reasons why when we're having this debate we need to get away from what do the 40% of generally over-indexed white males in office jobs how do we treat them and start to think about the wider workforce and how we successfully manage all of that.\nBut I think the other thing, even if you go into that subset of people who are in the office one of the difficulties I think is that when we're in a remote situation we tend to speak to the people that we know the most and certainly what we saw over the first lockdown was the reduction in the number of contacts or the range of contacts that individuals are making. So their worlds become slowly smaller, they're talking only to the same five or six or seven people and that isn't great for diversity of ideas, it isn't great for diversity of team and thought. And the other thing about physically being present together is you see different people of different backgrounds, of different genders, of different races and you remind yourself that those do exist in your organisation. And I think all of these challenges that actually make diversity and inclusion more important for the HR profession over the coming years than perhaps at any time during, certainly my working career.\nDL: One of the things that we did see last year during the pandemic is actually we put more effort into communicating about our inclusive practices because we saw a link of that to engagement and we did some new things but we actually told our story because we felt it was important to have a drumbeat of communication. And the perception that our people had when we did our poll surveys is that our commitment to inclusion has increased. So we had a much stronger response. And I think in the absence of doing other normal stuff that often crowds the communication chains, we focused on this area and brought to light some of the areas. And that has had a particular impact on some of the communities that we really want to focus on more.\nAnd so what that's helped us to learn is actually things that we already knew which is the power is in the story, the authentic story, the true story, the warts and all story, and the willingness to be able to say we don't always get it right and we want to listen and hear your view on it. And it's opened up a different level of conversation for us particularly. And as a result has opened up minds to the agenda. So I think to the point that Neil made which is when your world becomes smaller you have to put more effort into creating channels that will widen it if people can't see each other physically in an office and you can't control what their interacting with all of the time, what you can control of course is the stories that you're getting out there into the business. That's really important I think.\nNC: Well quite. These initiatives, Brad Taylor, cost money and in many ways of course HR has already been fighting for resources. So that could be a problem to carry out some of these ideas in the coming year?\nBT: Yeah but then I think what happened last year enabled HR to take a much more front seat because so much of the business was relying on HR to see the business through the pandemic and through the crisis. So I think in a lot of ways it helped the profession to take the lead and demonstrate that actually there's a lot of things that it can do and initiatives that it can put in place that really can be beneficial, not just to the employee base of the organisation but the leadership team as well. So in some ways there's never been a better opportunity for HR to be putting these initiatives and new ideas forwards and making the case for these sort of things because I think we've got a ready listening ear out there to all of the things that we would like to be doing.\nAnd I'd echo the point as well that Deb was making earlier on about the fact that we're seeing the same thing in terms of engagement has gone up and I think people being in this disrupted state has made them so much more open to collaborating with one another in different ways, to be more reflective about differences and how they come together to work effectively. I think it's helped organisations think differently about how they communicate with their people. So it's like an open playing field really in terms of being able to come forward with new ideas, new initiatives to take this forward.\nNC: And of course one of the areas where initiatives are definitely going to be needed is in mental health and wellbeing and a lot of people, let's face it, are going to start this new year burned out and isolated and needing help and in some cases Deborah Lee we may not even know which employees they are?\nDL: Yeah for sure I mean I would have probably put HR quite at the top of that list because we've been at the front of a lot of the change, a lot of the emotional turmoil and like many folk we haven't been able to even leave our home office environment for a breath of fresh air. So I think the need starts at home with HR and looking after each other and supporting each other and making sure that we're conscious of the burdens that we're carrying.\nNC: You see Deborah I noticed it's your view that this is an important area for HR to get involved with, I'm quite surprised you said that because does that mean some other parts of the organisation dealing with this that people don't look to HR to deal with this, or perhaps they haven't dealt with it properly in the past?\nDL: No I think HR firstly probably have got to treat themselves as a first point because often we're the cobbler's children and we don't look after our own needs in the same way, we spend all our energy in making sure everybody else is being looked after. I think the piece around mental health in general, it is a stressful time of year at the beginning of the year, we've just had Christmas and now we're back and it's miserable weather, certainly in the UK elsewhere it's maybe a bit better, but the thing around not being able to know, I mean this is one of the things I think. Mental health as a topic is getting more and more coverage and people are beginning to say it's okay but most of the time people aren't reaching out which means you have to be proactive in a) starting a conversation around making it okay to say that you need help b) equipping people, managers and support and teams to be looking out for each other and creating channels which people feel are confidential that they can reach out to when they do say they need help. But often there are pockets of individuals who won't even admit it to themselves that they are struggling. And it pops out in different ways: you can observe it in the behaviours; you can observe it in the tensions. And I think this is where HR need to be incredibly vigilant because, as we know, we all look for evidence that supports our own mental model of thoughts and if we'd like to think everything is easy that will see evidence to being it. But I think being awake to the point that actually it's likely that you've got a lot of people who are on the edge and therefore what are you doing to support that. But I would definitely say it's important at this point more than ever to look after your HR colleagues because they are, like you, probably hearing a lot of the tension, the frustrations, as normal and being asked to solve them all. And there's only so much you can carry.\nNC: So Neil Morrison at Severn Trent how are you tackling all that?\nNM: It's tricky isn't it because I think one of the things about mental health is that it affects different people in different ways at different paces: some people are very visible; some people aren't; some people are more comfortable about talking; some people aren't. We're very lucky we've got a well-established network of mental health first aiders within the organisation, we've done a lot of work over the last three or four years to really raise the profile of conversations around mental health and that's been incredibly beneficial for us during the pandemic.\nBut I think where it is tricky is often some of the visual cues that you would get from someone, so the ability to look at them, to look at how they're presenting, whether they're looking tired, whether they're looking a little bit dishevelled around the edges, whether they're just their body language is giving you a sense of being troubled is much, much easier to do in person. We are sentient beings. That sense of being around people is really, really beneficial to understanding how someone is and that's much harder online. And so what we're trying to get managers to do where they are dealing with people remotely, is to be more explicit about asking the questions. So if you're limited in the number of senses that you can use then you've got to over-index on the senses that you have, particularly around questioning and listening and tonality of voice and things like this to try and really understand.\nNC: Brad Taylor I know the CIPD's got a lot of resources in this area, any final thoughts for any of the work that you've done on what people professionals can do to make sure they're doing the best for people?\nBT: Certainly one of the things we saw last year was that every time we would survey our people, asking them both in terms of how they were coping with more remotely and how did they think about the future of working remotely, every time we did that more people would then suddenly speak up and say, 'Oh well actually I need help with a monitor, I need help with a chair, I need help with something else,' and it really does, it struck us that you can't ask people enough, you've got to keep talking about it with people, making it clear about where you see the organisation going, because people construct their own reality in their heads about how long they think this situation might last for and if it's left unchecked you have no idea that they're suffering with these sort of things. So I think poll surveying, speaking with your people and encouraging them to speak up is one thing. Using focus groups or sounding boards, groups of employees to come together with leadership and just talk through and try to validate what you think you're seeing from your survey data with actual people's lived experiences.\nAnd then the other thing that we've grappled with as well is the difference between blanket approaches or organisational approaches to these sort of things versus the individual role of the line manager. So we would worry a lot about people being on constant Zoom calls or Teams calls, video conferencing, and these are all ways of working that people are not originally accustomed to, so it's causing people to have to work in ways that demand extra cognitive load because they're having to do things a lot differently, you know it's a bit like when you first drive and you're thinking of everything that's going on inside the car rather than just getting to the destination, and that was draining people. So on one hand I think there are some blanket approaches you can do but it's not going to work for the entire organisation because different teams will work differently and the key thing that we've tried to encourage is the role of the line manager really does have to be keenly interested in mental health, wellbeing, inclusion, development, and having conversations, initiating conversations with their people about these things all the time, because it's dealing with the individual scenarios and working with your HR VPs to deal with those individual scenarios that will really make sure that as an organisation you're getting to all your people and you're helping them in their particular circumstances.\nNC: Great and as we come to the end just a final thought perhaps from each of you for this new year, Deborah any particular qualities you're going to try and deploy or get your people to deploy?\nDL: I think optimism is the first one. If you believe it you can feel it, you can do it. But I think the other thing is really working harder at creating more connection and maintaining some creativity in the process. It's one of the things that we see has suffered as a result of this remote working scenario in those teams because you're just not sparking that innovation of thought that Neil was talking about earlier. So finding methods of creating the space to connect and create that creativity will be continued for us.\nNC: Great and Neil Morrison what's your New Year message going to be to your people?\nNM: I think it's about fairness. It really is about thinking about fairness throughout everything. We've talked about the difference between home workers and those people that are working out in communities. We've talked about inclusion; we've talked about the challenges of those people with caring responsibilities; we've talked about flexible working; we've talked about mental wellbeing, all of that comes back to how do we build fairer, better organisations? And that comes down to individual decisions made by HR professionals and managers every day. And so bringing that lens into everything that we do.\nNC: Great. Brad Taylor.\nBT: I think it's about autonomy and openness, autonomy as in it's going to be more and more okay for you to go about your working day the way that works for you and don't become prisoner to the conference calls or perceived expectations that you've got to be in front of the keyboard all the time doing something. Build into your day focus time, build into your day time out just to have relaxed chats with colleagues and connect with colleagues as well as time to work on the projects and pieces of work. And feel empowered to do all of those things.\nNC: Great. Well thank you one and all, some terrific inspiration on that theme of turning surviving into thriving in 2021. This is clearly a year when the range of soft skills that we debated, you remember our last CIPD podcast we talked about soft skills, they should help us all support each other and get things done. And in that vein some great feedback from one listener, Ralph Lewis, noting how we all refer back, supported and developed each other's points, exactly what we did on this show, compare this, he said, to political interviews! Well to be fair it can be a lot harder when your guests don't actually choose to answer the actual question. Well you all certainly have today and that is our lot for this edition. Lots of good podcasts planned for the months ahead so please subscribe to make sure that you don't miss any of them.

      "summary": "In the last year or so there has been growing debate and conversation around the benefits of soft skills in the workplace and the essential or core skills we will increasingly need. The events of 2020 have prompted greater shows of empathy, teamwork and problem solving, but can getting these ‘softer’ skills right pay dividends in the long-term and do we need to value these skills more within our organisations?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, Rebekah Wallis, Director of People and Corporate Responsibility at Ricoh UK, Phil Lowe, Leadership Development Specialist and Lizzie Crowley, Senior Skills Adviser at CIPD, to unpack how a greater emphasis on nurturing, utilising and measuring the effectiveness of soft skills can benefit your organisation.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:29:00\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: When doing the job is so hard just now how far will soft skills get you? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nEvery day in 2020 each and every one of us has had to show kindness and sympathy to family, to friends and to co-workers. That's whether or not it always comes naturally. It's been the worst year in our professional lives but what the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us is how important it is to lead with the heart. There's been a lot of debate about the value of interpersonal skills to rally teams and support colleagues but is all this getting a bit fluffy, a fad born of our times? How far are soft skills going to get us when the going is tough and you've no choice about imposing hard decisions on others?\nHere to talk using, measuring and developing soft skills, and doubtless much more Rebekah Wallis, she's Director of People and Corporate Responsibility for Ricoh UK, who provide document services, consulting software and hardware worldwide. She's a board director with overall responsibility for human resources, learning and corporate responsibility. Hello.\nRebekah Wallis: Hello.\nNC: Phil Lowe has 30 years' experience as a , Leadership Development Specialist, a former senior consultant originally with Price Waterhouse Coopers, and People Development Manager at Goldman Sachs, his recent clients include BP, Barclays and the NHS and the Civil Service. Hello.\nPhil Lowe: Hello.\nNC: And from the home team Lizzie Crowley, Senior Skills Adviser to the CIPD, she's also published a number of influential reports on youth unemployment. Hello.\nLizzie Crowley: Hi there.\nNC: So Lizzie there are other blanket terms I suppose for the skills we're talking about here, essential skills, core, human, transferable, we know that employers repeatedly say that young applicants and many existing workers lack them, so .let's keep it simple what are soft skills?\nLC: I think that's part of where the problem is, is that we don't really have an agreed language to describe these skills, and we'll come onto that later, but that's a lot of work we've been doing at the CIPD. But if you think about those skills which enable individuals to work together in organisations, so team work, communication, listening, problem solving, we're talking about some of the really fundamental human capabilities that are very difficult all to make out and are becoming increasingly important.\nNC: And I suppose, Rebecca Wallis, these skills, they're not technical, they're not academic so maybe we shouldn't be too surprised that people aren't taught them.\nRW: That's a really good point actually in terms of whether people are taught them or not, in fact it's absolutely true in professional work people get their technical skills, quite often people are promoted through being a subject matter expert, we see a lot of that, but the importance, as Lizzie was saying of the soft skills it's that overlay, it's that ability, not to do something, it's to do it well, it's how you do it, how you fit in with your culture, environment and your teamwork. And absolutely I think there is a lack of teaching of soft skills.\nNC: And just quickly Rebecca in your organisation was it very apparent as 2020 wore on that some people didn't have these skills and maybe were at a disadvantage because they didn't?\nRW: I think it dramatically made us aware actually when we first went into the Covid situation the difference between those leaders who had the soft skills at the appropriate levels and those leaders who didn't became very, very evident and certainly those leaders who had those skills, through training, people aren't born with them they're trained to have them, it was evident the difference in how they managed their team. That's gone on through the whole of 2020 actually and continues as we speak.\nNC: Now Phil Lowe it's all very well being known around the workplace for your sensitivity, your understanding, but then of course people managers are having to make tough decisions at the moment, discipline people, demote them, all that, I think what you call people elements, and I just wonder whether all that sensitivity might actually just get in the way?\nPL: You're absolutely right first of all. I think there are always going to be situations in organisations, particularly at the moment but all the time, where you have to make quite tough decisions and you might have to act in a way that is not going to be great for people in the short-term. But the problem I think is that when people think about soft skills, for want of a better description and I agree with Lizzie it's not a kind of perfect way of describing them, but if we understand what we mean by that they swing between soft skills and what you might call more hard skills, the very kind of direct approaches which operate without empathy and don't take care of people particularly, people tend to see it as an either/or and I don't think it is, I think the best leaders and managers operate with a blend to keep it simple, let's say clarity and empathy: I can give you a clear message about your performance, I can also take care of you as a person.\nNC: Okay well Lizzie Crowley with that in mind I'm just getting a bit sort of twitchy about this because already at least two of you are not altogether happy about this term 'soft skills' I just wonder whether it's all a bit overblown, I mean the profession constantly striving to ensure what it does is evidence-based? Well before this podcast I spent a bit of a while consulting Dr Google and frankly evidence is pretty scant, perhaps I wasn't looking in the right learned journals but I mean I don't see much evidence that soft skills help you do the job?\nLC: Well I mean if you look at a lot of the major data sources that are out there these skills do come up, you know seven out of the top ten skills that are missing amongst employees and that businesses are looking for are these skills. These skills do fundamentally affect the bottom line, if you don't have them in your organisation it's very difficult to introduce new product, new process improvements, and do you know there's a sufficient amount of evidence out there that actually shows these skills, you know if you get them right it pays dividends. Google has for instance been studying teams for I think around about seven or eight years and it was these skills that they identified as the important ones to have in a successful team. It wasn't the deep specialist skills, it was people who are able to collaborate and communicate effectively with one another. And even like a randomised control trial in a factory setting done by MIT Sloan found a 250% return on investment for providing training and problem solving skills within five factory settings. So I think that there's quite a sufficient amount of evidence out there that they really do impact upon business performance.\nRW: Absolutely I think there is, when you look at the wider employee sense, the soft skills that feed into culture, culture feeds into how the workforce works. And we did do some work actually, Ricoh, actually we'd go out to customers to help them help their workforce as it were. And we took the opportunity in October to do a piece called Conscious Workplace, very psychologically based and stuff and it spoke to a sample of people and looked at what were the key things that were important during this. And a lot of this was around decision-making, what was actually the successful companies, how they came out of it. We referred earlier to decision-making as a key skill, particularly during times of crises, but also things around looking at the impact on employees around things like mental health and the link with that and productivity, obviously, I'm sure Lizzie can quote some statistics, but people being well psychologically, physically and so on, but in this case we're talking psychologically, but then the link with that and empathy from managers, that support from managers, so I think I absolutely agree with what Lizzie is saying there is a fundamental link between productivity and customer satisfaction, company success with employees and how they're functioning and that comes from leadership and culture and how they're managed.\nPL: I wanted to add to that because I endorse that. I think one of the things that you do notice happens when you have leaders and managers, maybe not even a whole organisation doing this but you have individual leaders and managers who are able to work well with their employees is you get a big boost in loyalty. It is often said that people don't leave organisations they leave people and one of my clients that happened to be a research company, did a huge piece of research and they found that the biggest factor when anybody chose to leave the organisation was the behaviour of their own boss. So I think some of the research that I've seen has a bit of a question mark over productivity actually but I'll bow to Lizzie's, which is probably more recent, but if you think about it you can get productivity out of people by beating them and making them very scared, what you don't get though is employees who will be loyal to you over the longer-term and that can be quite a significant thing.\nNC: So taking that up with you Lizzie how can you crystallise this link between having good soft skills and outcomes? I mean again to quote the evidence-based thing you know that old thing at the interview where you're asked, can you tell me about a time when this happened and you did this and that was the outcome?\nLC: I do think that we need to get better about measuring these types of skills and valuing them more in organisations and I think one of the reasons why we actually have a bit of a weak evidence base here, I'm not saying we, the examples I quoted at you earlier they do exist, they are relatively robust but I do think we need to work at better strengthening our evidence base around the values that these skill sets bring into organisations. And also about what are some of the best ways to develop these skills within the context of employment. That's why we've been doing a lot of work through the essential skills taskforce to develop a very detailed, measurable set of skills that enable you to look at how people progress across these softer skill sets. We call them essential skills. But I do take the point that the evidence base is not necessarily that clear cut in here. We've got some indications about the importance of these skills and I think going back to what businesses say through major surveys about actually what is stopping them actually getting on with the things they want to do, the products and the processes that they want to improve on, the innovation that they want to happen within their organisations, in many cases it is these skills that are holding them back and time and time again it comes out through survey work that that is a fundamental fact.\nNC: Okay so if these skills are holding people back and we want to push them forward with them Rebecca Wallis what do you do in your organisation? I mean if you look at your website there's an awful lot about the value you place on these kind of things, how do you nurture people and help them to develop these skills so that they can use them in their day-to-day business life, and of course it's particularly important now because they're not learning from each other in an office, in the main people are working virtually?\nRW: Yeah to pick up on your first point I think virtually it is hard, I think to really engender and embed these skills to some extent you do need to interact with other people, but that aside in terms of what we're doing, so we have a long history of leadership programmes where the soft skills are structured with people in support and training and measured to some extent but measured in terms of output interestingly. So someone would have an example of a project they wanted to do, how they'd work with a team, and then that would have to be a distinct return on investment. Picking up on Lizzie's point around essential skills, something we're doing going forward or are currently in the process of doing is actually embedding within our leadership programmes, within our other programmes, some of the core essential skills through the Skills-builder Framework, which do have levels from 1 - 15 which can be measurable. So in terms of putting someone in you can assess where someone starts on a particular skill like listening, put some intervention in, some support in and then measure again if they've increased in those skills. And that's what we're looking to do, going forward we're looking at currently particularly looking at for younger people, for apprentices coming in, those leaving school or education, but also for middle managers, for people who've been with us a long, long time. so I think there is something in there that has a lot of potential in terms of, one, being recognised when we talk about the language, and different people do use different languages and different terms for soft skills, but also how we measure the effectiveness of any interventions. And those can be multiple, online, face-to-face, coaching and mentoring are amazing for developing people's soft skills and skills generally. But again those can be tailored to the learner or tailored to the circumstances that we find ourselves in.\nNC: Phil, though do you want to pick up that point about measuring, training, actually working with people, what do you think is helpful, because we all know managers and colleagues who are super deficient in people skills?\nPL: I was really interested to hear that list of things from Rebecca that they're doing because it is true that these kind of skills are fiendishly difficult to measure often and I mean back in the 90s Coopers & Lybrand, as it was then, just before they became PWC, spent several years and a lot of money trying to develop a system called Econometrics, and the idea of this is that it will give you hard measures of what HR activities were delivering, so that you could go to the finance director and say, 'See look at all the value I'm creating, let me have a bigger budget,' but they couldn't do it, they couldn't make it work. But I think that, picking up on one of Rebecca's examples you measure and then you measure again, one client of mine did a very good job of building, this was around organisational values, I know this is a bit of a minefield to get into and we haven't mentioned them yet but organisational values which were all about promoting the softer side of this organisation, and this was a manufacturing organisation so they were taking it really seriously. So what they did was they went to the annual performance review process and they said, 'Right we're going to split it 60/40, 60% of your annual review is on your business delivery, 40% is on you living our values.' And I was the person who was leading the workshops for leaders in the organisation to help them, support them, in how to run their reviews. And of course what everyone was saying was, 'Well how can I tell if someone's living the values, you can't measure that it's not a hard thing?' What we got them doing was having the equivalent conversation that you would have if you were setting a goal for someone. So in someone's business performance you set a goal at the beginning of the period, the year or the quarter, or whatever it is, and then you come back and you see how they've done against that goal. And the values equivalent of this was to have a kind of little bit of a debate and discussion between the leader and the individual to say, 'Okay if you were going to live this particular value you, in your job, at the moment with everything else going on, what would we need to see you doing that would tell us that you were living it?' So they'd have that kind of dialogue early on in the process and then the manager would know what to look at and what they were going to be observing to help them gather some data and the employee knew very clearly what it was that they were being observed on and what they were being assessed, for want of a better word, on and so there was a great openness about the process. So I think the measures very often they can be subjective, which is what some people struggle with, but if they're subjective and agreed and both manager and employee know what it is that is being measured then I think it can actually be much more easy than people think to do that.\nLC: Yes I think that is the key point here. We've done quite a bit of work in this space and actually what the framework, the Skills-builder Framework is most useful for in many respects is to being a self-reflective development tool. So it's very detailed, it's broken down into these, you can sort of self-assess yourself. The interesting thing is though that actually when we got HRDs in organisations to look at these detailed breakdowns they say well they've got people in senior management positions who maybe score only a level three at some communication skills, so I think having some combination of self-reflection and 360 degree feedback around these skill sets. But I suppose there is a challenge here because it's easy to talk for instance to an employee or to someone in your leadership team and say, 'Well you've got this technical skill gaps missing, we need to offer you some training in this area,' but if you actually say to someone, 'Well I don't think you're necessarily that good at this type of softer skill,' so working in a team and you've broken that down, I mean it is a more challenging conversation to have with employees when you're identifying weaknesses in this area. And also we need to recognise that they often take quite a long time to change because it's not a change in knowledge that you're seeking it's a change in knowledge and behaviour. So they do take longer and it sometimes can be a bit more of a challenge to talk about them.\nPL: I think there's a very simple thing you can do, if you want to give somebody a message that says in effect, you are not delivering on this soft skill, you just need to do the same thing, or you need to create a missing link to be the equivalent of a business area. So in other words you tell them what the impact is of them not doing this particular thing. There's an aspect of your team working which is deficient and the impact of that is going to be that the team will not meet its goals and therefore the business will lose this and this. So in other words you turn it into a hard business measure further down the chain and that then makes the link for people I think and they can see why it's so important.\nNC: Rebecca Wallis, the buck stops with people in a job like yours, just tell us how soft skills specifically help you personally in your daily work leading human resources?\nRW: I guess to some extent as an HR manager you do need to be a role model in a role model department, to sort of walk the talk as it were, and how does it help me in my day-to-day work? I think in terms of when you talk about things like listening, you talk about things like speaking, communicating, all key skills, they are things that you do need to ideally be pretty good at because you are talking effectively the voice of the organisation, you're talking to managers, in Phil's words, to try and help them to be better managers effectively.\nNC: Do you ever have to remind yourself to do these things?\nRW: At a very personal level I think I do try to be very authentic and work in a way which is, but I do also recognise it comes very naturally to me so kind of like I'm inside the organisation and I'm outside the organisation like that. I also recognise it doesn't always come but that's through years of experience, years of learning, years of getting it wrong I think it's fair to say. And yes I'm not perfect, I'm not trying to imply that. But do I have to remind myself? I think at times it can. I think what's interesting actually when we think back to the last 12 months is there are times I think where we were making decisions with very, very, very little data and you're having to make quite quick decisions, quite hard decisions, as we said earlier, and I think at those times is the times where I felt gosh normally I would have listened, I would have spoken, I would have asked, I would have gathered views, and things like that, and that's where you kind of get that conflict between actually utilising your soft skills, your essential skills and actually just having to get the job done in the best way possible. But yes a good question.\nNC: And Lizzie Crowley let's go down the food chain a little bit to the rank and file people working in human resources, just a quick thought or two from you on which in a way are the most useful skills to deploy and how you can acquire them if you don't have them?\nLC: Well I think everyone has skills in these areas, it's being able to reflect on actually where some of your weaknesses and your development needs lie as an individual. So we all have experience of working in teams and I think one of the key things which have been shown to be incredibly powerful here is around having a mentor. And Rebecca mentioned earlier about the importance of mentoring and coaching initiatives internally. So we've set up, CIPD, some of our own mentoring networks with senior HRDs and people working within the HR profession at a lower level because we recognise the critical importance of having someone you can listen to, talk problems through, and actually to be able to identify areas where you maybe need to go away and work to improve on certain skillsets and it's absolutely critical for these skills in particular.\nNC: And Phil what about people who are just starting their career, often in HR, they're doing a lot of process stuff, in many ways they probably don't get chance to interact with people enough, especially with remote working, so how do they actually learn these skills?\nPL: First of all there are some fundamental basics that anybody, regardless of role or in the situations that you describe, can learn. For example, if you look at motivation theory one of the fundamental things that underpins most motivation is a feeling of significance. So in other words if you could make all your employees feel significant, i.e. that they matter, that you notice them and so on, and the very simplest way to do that is to make eye contact with them, which people don't do any more. And I think, for example, one of the reasons that people find Zoom, Teams and other virtual platforms so tiring is no one's looking at you, no one's making eye contact with you, we're all kind of looking somewhere else on the screen. So your person, for example, whose got a pretty heavy desk job, not interacting with people very much, if all they did when somebody came over and said, 'Have you got a moment,' was stop what they were doing and looked the person in the eye and listened to them for a moment, that would have such an impact on that individual who spends their days going around with everybody multi-tasking and not paying them any attention at all. And your junior HR person would find all of a sudden that they're getting quite highly rated by people for being a very effective people person, and all they're doing is just paying somebody some attention when they talk to them.\nLC: I do think though we have a bit of a challenge here with the current working arrangements, particularly for new labour market entrants, and many of these skills are learnt by observing your more senior colleagues and how they behave in certain situations and so on. So actually for young people I think they are missing out a big part of their career development at the moment by us all being forced to work in these ways. Technology has got some great solutions to help support people, peer-to-peer learning communities and so on, but I don't think that's ever going to take the place of actually real world experience of seeing people behave in a more normal, sorry I'm just trying to find a way to...\nNC: At least you didn't mention the new normal, so that was something.\nLC: Yeah.\nNC: Rebecca Wallis\nRW: Yeah I agree with you. I think at the moment we haven't been in a position to heavily recruit but things that we would have done in the past such as work placement, work experience, when we're talking young people, entry level roles, I'm struggling at the moment to know how to do that in an effective way because you're absolutely right the role modelling of seeing what happens, even the apprentices in the past who'd just bring a notebook and a pen to a meeting, you know you wouldn't say that because you couldn't actually see it on video calls, you can only see a certain amount of space. So I think that there is a whole, well I don't want to say a whole generation because that's not strictly true, but you know there is a whole tranche of people who will miss out on accelerating those essential skills, those soft skills at the very beginning of their career. And picking up on Phil's point, those things, those small little differences that people can make are massive in terms of not just their own career and development but in terms of the people they interact with and the overall impact. So I think it's quite troubling at the moment.\nNC: Okay so just looking at how we can just continue developing and using some of these essential soft skills in 2021, Phil do you think we've got to peak soft skills because of the pandemic or will we actually need them more in the future?\nPL: I think yes to the extent that people are feeling pretty bruised pandemic-wise, they're feeling quite lost and I think having a workplace that makes them feel important and feel like they matter is going to go a long way towards, from a collective mental health point of view, I think will be a very, very good thing that organisations can do. But having said that the other thing that a lot of people are complaining about in the pandemic time is they don't get any clarity, they don't know what's going on, and I think that's edging into your hard skills, but I think that's something that organisations could really bear in mind is people want clarity, they want somebody to look them in the eye, well you know obviously look them in the eye, from what I said before, look them in the eye and say, 'This is what we expect, this is what we want you to do, this is how we'd like you to do it all' whatever that conversation is. But clarity and simplicity along with empathy I think that's hard to get the two in balance sometimes but a combination of the two could work really well.\nNC: And Lizzie Crowley some of us who've worked through the analogue age and gone into the digital age another thing is that in order to get things done we need to influence people, often virtually, often perhaps when we wouldn't necessarily have the real authority in the organisation to do it, and I suppose that's where soft skills come in?\nLC: Yes I mean negotiating and influencing individuals has been an incredibly important soft skill that individuals really need to learn and develop over the course of their careers and I think just coming back to the question you asked Phil there about are these things going to be less important 2021 when we come out of the pandemic, I mean my view is that these skills are only going to become even more important as technology continues to reshape work and actually a lot of the more routine, or some of the more technical skills become automated. It is these things, if you think about it from the HR perspective, some of those processes you mentioned earlier about tasks people might be doing earlier on in their careers those things are more vulnerable to automation and the ability to work together, to interrogate, to critically think, to negotiate, to influence, those things will only become more important and you can't automate those.\nNC: Rebecca Wallis final thought from you.\nRW: Absolutely, I was just going to absolutely agree with what Lizzie says and I think when people have looked at this research and I'm a firm believer in this, I think if we can see the essential skills, soft skills as the foundation for any job, and we know lots and lots of people are going to have to retrain, upskill, cross-skill, over the coming decade and beyond but every job you look at in theory, and in my belief it is done better by having good core skills. So that's the foundation, the building block for every other job with the technical aspects overlaid, is fundamental too as we go forward into the future. So my belief is that they do become more and more important as people move careers.\nNC: Rebecca Wallis thanks very much indeed, fundamental indeed. And certainly one of the things I've learnt today, even as we talked through many aspects of these skills it's too easy to fall into the trap of thinking soft skills are about being soft, when of course it's to do with how you use your head in any situation, and as we've heard we've all got to work on those soft skills to get through 2021. It would certainly be a shame if we don't use them more to influence others.\nNow a quick word, last month we talked about how to change your organisation's learning culture, we touched on that a bit this time too, so it was pleasing to see a post afterwards from a retailer in these troubled times, Carpetright, saying they're appointing a new head of L&D to spearhead simple but effective strategies to inspire colleagues and retain talent so they become an employer of choice. So just what we were talking about. And that all important podcast we did about employment life after Brexit that's still up and very relevant at the moment.\nYou can see that and all our other podcasts on the CIPD website, so please subscribe so you don't miss any.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:32:12\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Better trained, more capable staff make successful organisations, we know that but do you have the right learning culture to nurture your people? Stay with us for top tips to improve yours.\nHello I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast. Now more than ever before every business is being forced to rethink how its people gain the skills they need to do their jobs and it's the learning and development teams who are in the thick of it. But there's a way to go, CIPD research shows that only around a third of L&D types feel that they've achieved a positive culture for learning at their place.\nSo this podcast isn't so much about the mechanics of virtual learning in the age of Covid-19, with or without Zoom on a dodgy line, it's about, deep breath here, learning cultures. It's about spotting what's wrong with your learning environment at work and how you can go about changing it for the better.\nWith us an occupational psychologist turned HR practitioner, turned member of the CIPD research team she's led much of the CIPD's work on L&D it's Mel Green. Hello.\nMel Green: Hi Nigel.\nNC: And we've a real life head of learning and development with first-hand experience of managing the learning culture in a large, complex organisation, from NatWest Bank it's Gavin McQuillan.\nGavin McQuillan: Hiya Nigel.\nNC: So Gav let's start by trying to get our heads around what we mean by an organisation's learning culture, and I know you've got 65,000 staff who all need to be trained in what they do, I suppose in security and using ever-changing technology in helping customers and the bank to make money. I would have thought it's the bank staff's training needs that dictates what you teach people so for you what is the learning culture of an organisation, there's sort of an implication it goes a bit deeper?\nGM: Yeah absolutely and I think traditionally Nigel you're right, especially in financial services which as we know are highly regulated I think there's an opinion that learning culture  would be about what do we need to know to keep our staff and our customers safe. And to a certain extent that is still true today but I think as things are changing in the world and people, and certainly us from a NatWest perspective, really can see the value of true learning culture, becoming a true learning organisation we're really, really starting to think about how can we empower people to learn what they want, when they want, not just in the role that they do today but the career they want to have tomorrow, but also bringing forward the notion that learning isn't something that is done to you, learning is something that you would want to do. So actually how do we empower our learners to take that into their own hands and to progress forward?\nSo when we talk about our learning culture for me it's not just about formal learning it's how do you create that environment where people are learning every day, people are empowered to learn, people are sharing what they're learning, but it's not just for the good of the organisation it's actually for the good of the individual as well and that's something that we are really keep to develop in NatWest as we move forward.\nNC: Now Mel Green we have this rather stark CIPD research finding that two thirds of L&D practitioners don't seem to think that they have a positive learning culture, I mean the cynic might say well they're the learning experts in their business so they can't be doing their jobs very well.\nMG: So I think there's a couple of pieces to unpack there and I think Gav said it really nicely when he said it's not just about formal learning it's about the informal things as well, it's not just about training. So I think the first thing to unpack is what do we really mean by learning culture, is it something that we can ever fully achieve? And also whose responsibility is it to create it? So of course learning professionals absolutely need to be spearheading a positive environment for learning but we know it's more than just formal training, we know it's more than just individual learning, it's really important that when we talk about learning cultures or the learning environment it takes into account the systemic environment for learning.\nSo we've done some research on this which is all about assessing the evidence on learning cultures and it's clear that it's such a broad concept that also feeds into things like whether an organisation is willing to take the new learning on board, whether it can innovate what management practices do you have in place to support learning but also that informal, reflective stuff and actually that's something that L&D professionals should champion but ultimately they're not the only player in that space so it needs to be a broader organisational vision I think.\nNC: But if I could just push you on those findings why is it that L&D people are saying, they obviously have some concept of what this is, and they say that organisations don't have a very positive culture so what are they getting at? What's making them unhappy?\nMG: So we've done some research slightly more recently on this which is our Learning And Skills At Work survey and we asked learning professionals what their current environment for learning looks like and there are some really interesting findings there about line management. So around half said that line managers don't necessarily always support learning or facilitate learning, and while they feel like senior leaders have a vision for learning there's that disconnect between what line managers support and facilitate and what senior leaders say. So there's some really interesting environmental factors to think about there.\nAnd of course another thing to point out is we're talking about learning culture as an outcome here, it's an ongoing process, we always need to think about how we update and iterate how we help people to learn, I think Covid shown us that more than ever that we sometimes need to rapidly shift and that's really what about a learning environment is. But it's not a one-stop shop.\nNC: I'd like to take up with Gav that point you're making about management, I mean isn't half the problem that managements too often see training and learning as a kind of emergency fix, you know people can't work the new kit so they have to do some emergency training or maybe they force you to do some online health and safety course in your own time often, it's all reactive rather than proactive, I mean really a bit of box-ticking exercise.\nGM: Yeah to Mel's point I think probably the reason that learning professionals, and maybe slightly controversial is, we've created this problem by that approach Nigel that you talk about which is making everything mandatory, making everything that becomes a box-ticking exercise, so in a way we are probably a little bit culpable in what we've created. That being said I totally agree with Mel's point that leaders play such an intrinsic part in creating this culture and for me it's not so much about a learning culture it's about a culture of continuous learning is I think where we should be driving to now in society because I think what we know from all the various surveys on skills and the change in marketplace, people are going to have to continue to learn as they develop their careers rather than just see learning as something that you did maybe at school or university and then once you get into the corporate world you can maybe take your foot off the gas a little bit.\nSo I think managers play a key part in that. I think we need to empower them to really incentivise people to learn, to let people see the importance of it. But to do that I think we need to speak their language. I think we need to understand that learning isn't at the top of everybody's agenda. While we would like it to be people are very busy, there's a lot going on so how do we help people see the value that it adds and then how do they build it into their day to day work? And I think that's a real key part for us. But to Mel's point this will never work unless we have the leaders from the top, right the way down, bought in and really role modelling this for me. So leaders as teachers is probably an old fashioned phrase but it's probably the best one I've got at the moment around how they can really start to supercharge this kind of culture of continuous learning that I think we're all striving for.\nNC: So to simplify some of that Mel what Gav seems to be saying is that people have got to want to learn, to see the need to learn, and it should just be a process which is forced upon them or indeed something that they're denied when they want and ask for more training.\nMG: Yeah absolutely. And it needs to be something that's important to the individual but it needs to link to organisational outcomes as well and I think when we're thinking about what a learning culture is that there's different parts to it isn't there? There's what the individual needs to learn to do their day to day role, there's what they need to develop, but it's also how teams need to adapt and change and how we feed that into what our organisation does and ultimately adapt to as well. So there does need to be that golden thread that's really clear throughout an organisation that learning is the way we do things around here. Mistakes are okay, iterating is okay and absolutely, senior leaders need to be really bought into that for that to really stick.\nNC: Well Gavin you run learning and development at a really large bank, clearly there's an organisation which is very focused on its financial goals so presumably you're pretty closely plugged into the management of your organisation, just talk us through how the culture of learning has changed in the last few years at your place, one hopes for the better?\nGM: I think some of the big changes for us over the last couple of years is that we've been working really, really hard to align our learning strategy with business strategy and so to Mel's point again before, that relevance. People need to see the relevance of and the understanding of how learning will be an enabler for what we're trying to achieve as a business. So we've worked a lot of effort has gone into working with senior leaders and supporting that. I guess what really, really helped us and the cherry on top of that work was that Alison Rose our new CEO is really focused and one of her big priorities was to create this culture of continuous learning, to really focus on us becoming a learning organisation and investing, not just in learning for our colleagues but also who could be helped, the broader society around some of the challenges that we've got.\nNC: So what more would you do with people now other than just giving them the obvious tools to enable them to carry their jobs? What's the extra bit that you've added that makes this an improved culture?\nGM: So I think the first thing is we're really encouraging people to prioritise learning, so not just the leaders but the learners to say, look this is important how do you prioritise it within your day? So we did something, which I'm sure there'll be many different learning professionals listening to this who have an opinion where we came out with a people pledge which says, we want you to spend 10% of your time learning.\nNow for me personally what was important about that was not the number, because I'm sure you could have a great debate around what number's right, but what was important was the sentiment behind that number, to say this is important we want you to prioritise learning. We created a learning academy, and again that was about just making learning really easy for people to find.\nAnd then we did some really key things around moving away, not just to have technical learning but really focusing on those, what I would call, the power skills for people in the future. So things like critical thinking, innovation, building relationships, learning agility. So actually how do we help people grow as individuals for, as I've said today, the job that they do today but the career that they want to have tomorrow. So good investment; good empowerment; raising the profile of what we're doing but actually we're on a journey here and I think, as we've all said I don't think you'll ever be finished, we'll never be finished this piece of work because things keep moving around but that's some of the, I guess, real practical things that we've seen change in the last 12 months.\nNC: Well it's great to hear what you're doing in this field, let me make it slightly more theoretical with Mel Green, you obviously don't want to blindly start improving specific courses or specific things you've got to first work out what state your learning culture is in and so can you talk us some of the things you might do to assess or benchmark how you're doing this so that when you make changes they're actually going to produce some dividends?\nMG: Sure and I think Gav shared some really nice examples of practical things that you can do which is why it's so important to take targeted action. So think about where you might need to improve things or build on good practice as well. I think the first thing to say is that learning culture is really broad and there's a danger that we only focus on one thing, so we need to measure multiple things. And there's also, I think, a real temptation to use things like training uptake as a measure of learning culture. And of course that's a really important one, we want to understand who's undertaking learning, whether that's formal or informal, who in the business is that? Are there different groups who learn more than others? Are there different teams that are struggling? That's really important.\nBut I think we also need to look at the broader picture. So we know learning culture has lots of different aspects to it, even things like employee influence, voice and innovation are important. So thinking a little bit about some of those other organisational indicators that can tell us how learning is used at work. So many of us will have a culture survey or an engagement survey that can give us an insight into whether people feel like learning is supported or whether iteration and new ideas are supported too. That's a really good indication of whether new learning and innovation is really fed into how things are done in the organisation, that's a little bit different. And also there's things like whether people are using the tools on offer, whether people feel like they're supported by their manager to learn, so really a suite of different things are really needed here to make sure we're not just talking about that formal learning and thinking about some of the other things that need to be in place as well\nGM: Yeah, again I think what Mel talks there is the formal stuff to me is almost hygiene factors and I think sometimes as learning professionals we're too focused on learning hours or things like that. They're an important part of the journey but for me they're not the biggest thing, for me it's those kind of cultural indicators of behavioural change. So for example do you see greater innovation? Do you see more knowledge sharing going on in your business? Feedback is a great one for me. Feedback is such a simple thing but it's a great way of developing a learning culture and so you see and people giving feedback how do you propagate that?\nSo yeah I really like Mel's analogy there around those hygiene factors are important but that's what they are, hygiene factors, where are those big cultural and behavioural changes that you're seeing and how do you measure them? And that's tougher and that's why I think sometimes as learning professionals we do like some of the easier stuff because it's there. This is tough to measure and I think that's part of the continual focus that we all should have as learning professionals around what are those measures to help you understand if you're making headway or not.\nNC: And let's just be clear what you mean by hygiene factors?\nGM: Yes so what I mean by that is I think in the past we've been really good, as Mel talked about, around measuring what people do around formal pieces of learning, so how many hours do people spend on learning? How many courses? What's the attendance? And as I say that stays a part.\nNC: No more away days?\nGM: Well that's a different conversation. So they are great to let you know how you're getting on but I think just that on its own tells you more about the efficiency of your learning proposition rather than the culture that you're driving. It helps but I think to Mel's point you need those behavioural things and those cultural changes as well and to measure them and to bring the two together then you start to understand progress.\nNC: And talking of bringing people together we've heard already reference to management, Mel it is hard to change the culture if L&D is marooned in a kind of silo, semi-detached from the bosses and the business goals and also out of touch with individuals who now of course are scattered all over the place during Covid?\nMG: Yes so I think it's really important that, I think Gav you've said you've used this term before sort of speaking the language of managers because we know that managers are really key but we also know that managers have a huge amount of constraints and pressure on them as well. They need to deliver on operational goals which really should involve people management goals but we know often they might not, so it's all about helping them understand why this learning is of benefit to them because ultimately we're trying to drive an outcome here. If we're talking about creating a learning culture we're doing that for a reason, we want to see more innovation; we might want to see improved skills; we might want to drive to more knowledge sharing for example; and all of those ultimately, if done well, are going to impact to how people perform, how people develop and ultimately that's going to impact the bottom line which is really important for managers because it will help them deliver what they want to deliver. So really speaking their language I think is so important.\nNC: Isn't there a bit of tension here Gavin because we're talking about the way to make the organisation more effective, to make people have more rewarding careers but of course the pressures on organisations are enormous and managers cannot deliver for people, jobs are going in places, so is that a barrier to actually winning more trust from people?\nGM: I don't know if it's a barrier, I guess I can probably turn that on its head and tell you what my opinion on that would be which is I think now the concept, if you think about working for a bank 20, 30 years ago when I joined people thought they had a job for life and that's not anything that exists anymore, so I guess for us the way we look at it is if we're investing in people's skills and development yeah it might be for a career that they're having with NatWest but it also might be for something that's going to help them propel on the next stage of their career that might be in a different organisation, a different line of industry and something totally different.\nSo I think how you win that trust is by just making it a key part of your employee value proposition. So again this gets back to this point around yeah we need to train people for their jobs to do today but actually what we're trying to do is give them lifelong learning skills and lifelong learning that they can take and go and do many different things with that. And that I think is where you start to win back some of that trust.\nSo for example as people leave NatWest then what we're looking at is how do we help them leave with, you know leave them well, how do we continue to keep investing in them after they've left from a skills perspective so that they feel supported? So you can't come away from the reality of what that looks like but I think you can help people and that's where I think from a purposeful perspective we're trying to move to.\nNC: Okay so Mel Green I know you've looked across the piece at different ways that organisations have implemented changes to their cultures are there any particular signs that things are improving?\nMG: So I think when it comes to measuring progress there are certainly some of the indicators that you can measure over time, so things like whether people take part in learning, how people feel managers are supporting them, how we help people to learn, things like that. But I think what our research very much suggests is that when we talk about learning cultures whether or not creating a huge culture shift is the most effective thing to do is up for debate.\nSo when we look at the learning cultures literature and academic research it's a really broad concept but what is less clear is what's most effective, what pieces should we really be focusing on? So we really suggest that we reframe that culture piece as the environment for learning and use some of these factors that I talked about as a framework to measure progress. So look at things like people management practices, how they help people learn and influence organisational decision making, whether they have a voice, that sort of thing to really think about how things are changing but really tie it to tangible organisation practices. Instead of thinking about huge wide scale culture change it might be more effective to think about how we can create a supportive environment for learning and tie that back to a tangible organisational practice.\nGM: What's changing I think across the industry and I'm sure many people who do similar jobs to me would acknowledge this that I think the interest in learning has changed. I think we're seeing it move from potentially being seen as a cost on investment. I think we're seeing the C suite far more engaged around trying to understand what skills and capabilities their workforce needs and actually seeing it as that kind of competitive advantage around how we'll move things forward. We know there'll be a skill shortage around certain key areas, so actually I think being able to see learning as a strategic partner rather than something that was done to people, as you say Nigel, to help them use systems, is changing and I think we see that across many, many boardrooms across the world that we're in. So for me that might be doesn't talk to your cultural piece but I think it starts to help drive that culture because it's now seen as a strategic imperative whereas maybe it wasn't in the past.\nNC: Maybe Gavin just tell us a little bit more about what you actually do all day and every day to kind of push this process forward? I mean L&D, let's be honest is a bit of a mystery to people in other parts of the business.\nGM: From my perspective I think first of all it's about building relationships and engaging people and you do need to be close to the business, I think you need to get that foot in the door and when you've got that foot in the door you need to be thinking about how you're building relationships, how you're listening, how you're adding value. So a big part of my job is about understanding the strategy of the bank and then being able to overlay the strategic direction of L&D and talk about how we're adding value. So that's one part of it.\nI think the second part is that talking to people in the voice that they want to hear. So we're continually thinking about how do we engage people and that's not just in what they're learning and how they're learning but how we engage them to get them to learn. So we spend a lot of time on that. We still spend some good time around solution development, as you would expect. Curation is obviously a big part for my team around actually finding the great learning.\nAnd then the final part is just how do you make learning easy for people. So we know that people are time poor how are we just making learning easier for people to find on the formal piece but on that informal piece again Mel said that it's not the responsibility of L&D to create this culture it's the responsibility of everybody in the organisation. I think while L&D professionals play a bigger and bigger part is how do we help encourage that culture, how do we propagate it, how do we encourage it? And we do that in many, many different ways through great systems and technology, helping people with those kind of great behaviours and really just helping people role model that and engaging those leaders as we said before around how do you create that safe environment where people want to innovate, people want to take risks? So a lot of our development is about creating the culture that we want people to have, as well as doing probably quite a few emails still unfortunately in my day to day.\nNC: I want to ask Mel about the culture of an organisation in terms of learning, is that not somewhat broken up because everybody is scattered, I mean maybe people who are stuck at home might be less willing to learn new things when they're not steeped in a house culture, you know all that stuff that comes from the structure of being at work, having chats round the cooler, being supervised, being able to ask questions across the desk? I mean homeworking must mess with the way we learn?\nMG: I think it changes the way we access learning and how we do it organically because as you said Nigel it is more difficult when you're remote working to grab someone for a quick chat or ask someone very quickly if they've got five minutes but I don't think it's impossible when we're doing that remotely and I think if we really do think we've got a really positive environment for learning it doesn't require supervision and structure, we want people to really be empowered to learn on their terms and be able to access that when they need it.\nSo actually there's some aspects of remote and digital working that can actually really support that, so we know organisations are thinking more and more about how they make sure that their learning is digital and accessible but we also do know that we perhaps need to think about how we facilitate that more social, informal side and it's really important again that I'll say it again managers are really important here because they can really help teams be more cohesive, they might need to spend a bit more time thinking about how they facilitate that knowledge exchange and those collaborations but I certainly don't think it's impossible and if anything it's a really good opportunity for organisations and L&D teams to think about how we change things up and make sure people can access learning when they need it in a method that suits them as well.\nNC: Okay and Gavin do you want to say any more about what the pandemic has taught you?\nGM: Yeah so I think it's accelerated their strategy, to Mel's point in the digital space. So we were on a virtual kind of journey anyway, that's just accelerated that. I think from a digital uptake point of view we are seeing far more people, if we talk about traditional LMS's for a minute, 41% of all interactions now are done on an app, on a mobile device rather than a desktop, so we hoped we would get there but the pandemic has accelerated that, to Mel's point, where people have got more choice around how they want to learn.\nI guess what it's made us focus on is when people are sitting at home they've got so much information hitting them haven't they, from various different sources. People are on Zoom a lot. We hear about the great Zoom fatigue, so I think what we're thinking about is how do we engage people so that we can get our messages across in that environment but also understand that in that environment people haven't got a lot of energy, so actually how do we make sure that what we're giving to people is relevant? How do we give people choice? I think that's really, really important. And how do we try and give them as personalised an experience as possible? So for me those are three ingredients of our strategy that we're working on that I guess are being accelerated because of the Covid situation of people being at home, just to try and make it as easy for people to do as we go forward.\nNC: And this is a bit of a wild question Gavin but do you think that corporate calamities like banks overreaching themselves, obviously before your personal time at NatWest, might have been prevent by a strong learning culture at the top?\nGM: Yeah and I don't know if a learning culture stops people doing bad things, what I hope it does is it lets people analyse what they've done, reflect on the good things and the bad things and move forward. I think we can sometimes, as a society, maybe this is just us being very British that we love to analyse what we've done badly rather than what we've done well, so I think a learning culture allows you to yeah absolutely reflect on the things that people should learn from and how could that have done better and the emotional side of it, but I think we should also get better at analysing the root cause of success. Let's play on our strengths a little bit more.\nSo I think there's a balance there but for me that learning culture is where you stop and pause and think, right what could we have done better; what has gone well; how do we build on it; and how do we learn and move forwards so that perhaps we don't make the mistakes that we've made in the past? I guess if you don't have that learning culture then you don't take that time to reflect, you're not as attuned to that, to the emotions of it and perhaps you continue to do what you've always done.\nNC: Mel you were nodding during that do you want to add anything there?\nMG: Yeah I think that's a really interesting question which really feeds into what is a learning culture and why is it broader than individual learning? It needs to be about organisational learning as well and I think Gav you put it really nicely when you said it allows people to take a pause and think about what went well and maybe what didn't go well. And really when we're talking about what a learning culture is that's really integral, it's about being open to mistakes but also learning from them and also using those mistakes and changing how things are done. And really that requires a huge amount of buy in and also people to think about how people management practices feed into that. So what opportunities do employees have to feedback when things have gone wrong? Is it a safe environment to admit that mistakes have happened because we know from other research we've done into things like ethical behaviour that when there's seen as ramifications for speaking up that can be really problematic and stop those issues coming to the surface which is why it's important we think of organisational learning culture as something quite broad because it taps into those other people management practices, other aspects of our organisational culture, they're all quite interlinked.\nNC: Okay and I've seen a list of some of the wider benefits of a better learning culture Gavin, I won't run through them all but I just wonder which of these might strike a chord with you since you've made changes in the business: efficiency and productivity gains; increased profit; decreased employee turnover as satisfaction levels rise; continuous improvement mindset, and we talked about that; developing leaders at all levels.\nGM: Yeah I think they're all good ones. The ones that jump out for me is that continuous improvement and innovation. So I think having that in your business people like to innovate, from my signs, and I think if you're going to grow your business innovation has got to be key. I think the decreased turnover one yeah the way I would put it is greater employee engagement and obviously you want it to be something that is really going to support your growth of your business and look after your customers and provide for that as well. So that's the three that resonate for me Nigel from that list,.\nNC: And I suppose also Mel encouraging, enhancing people's ability to embrace change because I mean well we've seen a lot of that in the last year.\nMG: Yeah absolutely. And thinking about how we can upskill people and individuals and teams to really be able to embrace that change is really important as well I think. As you've said we've seen that so much this year and what an interesting question will be going forward is whenever this might be, whenever the change forced by Covid slows down will organisations stop such agile behaviour or will they really capitalise on what they've learnt and really take that forward? And I think that's something really interesting to think about as we move into next year and beyond.\nNC: Well Mel it's certainly got us to think about it. And Gav just maybe one or two tips to end, something that you've done that's proved most effectively in changing people's mindsets in improving practices there?\nGM: I think for us a few practical tips and then a few cultural tips so I think what we've tried to do is when we make things mandatory what we've tried to do to make that as engaging as possible, to make it as short as possible and to make it as relevant as possible. So to counter the culture that you talked about at the top of the call Nigel, how do we engage people in a different way? I think then the other thing is how do you really start to focus on that culture? How do you help people understand what you mean by that and how do you engage with them? So we've done lots of different things this year around just trying to get people to engage with learning in a totally different way.\nSo yeah I think that's for me where you have to start. And I think the final point then to echo what Mel said is to understand the role that L&D plays in this cultural piece. You cannot create this on your own, you're there to propagate it, you're there to drive it from your position but you can't do it alone and you need to take all your leaders with you.\nNC: Excellent. Well I've certainly learnt a lot from this edition. With that we have to take our leave. Let me thank Gavin McQuillan, Head of Learning and Development at NatWest and the CIPD's own Mel Green.\nJust time to mention our last podcast which remains highly topical with those endless post-Brexit trade talks still up in the air as we speak and we spell out the practicalities of the new migration restrictions, events prompting the Association of Professional Staffing Companies to comment that recruiters still feel unprepared without clear access to the flexible international skills they need. So give that last podcast a listen. Have a look through some of the recent ones, there's plenty there. And subscribe so you never miss an edition.

      "summary": "Due to the challenges of the global coronavirus pandemic, many organisations feel unprepared for incoming immigration changes brought about by Brexit. Priorities have shifted, and the onset of COVID-19 put workforce planning on the back burner. In what ways can organisations prepare for Brexit, and how will new migration restrictions impact their future plans?\nJoin Nigel Cassidy and this month’s guests, Marina Fernandez-Reino, The Migration Observatory, Ian Robinson, Fragomen and Gerwyn Davies, CIPD, to understand the true cost of post-Brexit recruitment and the importance of workforce planning.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:30:52\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: We're on the brink of the real EU exit with just weeks to go but so little resolved, what can you do now to ready your workforce for post-Brexit Britain? Hello, I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWe may have officially left Europe but the most important, messy details have still to be sorted out. Trade friction, immigration and recruitment headaches loom and that's whether or not there's a deal in time.\nUntil now the coronavirus pandemic has overridden everything and this has left organisations unprepared come 2021, in just three months' time, how will you plug sudden skill shortages or go about hiring migrant labour? Will your EU workforce here still be legal? And now we're all homeworking are there loopholes? What's to stop you side-stepping Brexit and just employing European workers online from their homes?\nWith me Marina Fernandez-Reino, she's a senior researcher at the Migration Observatory, a quantitative sociologist specialising in labour market discrimination. Hello to you.\nMarina Fernandez-Reino: Hi, nice to meet you.\nNC: From our home team the CIPD senior labour market adviser, he leads and comments on many topics, including migration, the labour market and the EU workforce, so it's hello to Gerwyn Davies.\nGerwyn Davies: Morning Nigel.\nNC: And Ian Robinson is a partner in Fragomen's legal office in London where the team helps businesses make better use of the immigration system. Ian was formerly at the Home Office. Hello.\nIan Robinson: Hi Nigel.\nNC: So Ian on 1st January, 2021 this phony war will finally be over, the UK will be out of the transition period, can you just explain with or without a Brexit deal, with or without food shortages and gridlock at the Channel ports just remind us what immigration rules will be different from Day 1 and indeed what non-EU overseas people can come into the workforce and how?\nIR: So from Day 1 we will be in a situation on 1st January, 2021 where the UK ends its involvement in free movement. What that means in practice is that essentially there will be three groups of migrant workers in the UK: Europeans who were here before the end of the year, who can stay, they can make an application on the EU Settlement Scheme, it's really straightforward and they should be encouraged to, there could be serious consequences if they don't and that will mean that they can work unencumbered; you will then have Europeans who enter the UK and non-Europeans who enter the UK after the 1st January, 2021, and for that group they will be able to come and work so long as they are in a skilled job, they speak English and they will be sponsored by an employer over here, there will also be minimum salary requirements to meet; and then you also have a third group - non-Europeans who were here before the end of the year and for that group all of a sudden, whereas right now they may be tied to a temporary visa they will be able to move into a permanent category. So you need to be thinking slightly differently about your existing employees from outside of the EU.\nNC: So Gerwyn let's just roll back a little bit building on what we've just heard there, remind us what sensible organisations have been doing, or should have been doing, in the run up to all this? I mean are there still some people in limbo or liable to be thrown out?\nGD: Well one of the reassuring aspects to date is the success rate of the EU Settlement Scheme which Ian has referred to. We know that 3.6 million EU citizens have registered for that scheme which implies an extremely high success rate and I'm sure that's due in no small part to employer efforts to raise awareness among their workforces of both the need and the requirement for EU citizens to do that. And it's important to remember that the deadline for applications is 30th June, 2021, so for those outstanding employers who haven't raised awareness and perhaps have some concerns over one or two members of staff they still have eight months to do so. And so until then EU citizens have the same rights and conditions and enjoy the same rights and conditions as they currently do and will do so until the middle of next year.\nIR: Actually employers who aren't sure how to prepare their employees it's not too difficult, begin by reassuring people that they can stay; go on to educate them about making an application, and making the applications is really straightforward; and then direct them to apply before that deadline. Plan your comms around known milestones. Get something out quickly and as soon as you can. Think about sending something out before Christmas when free movement is due to end and there'll be lots of communications from the government. And then again in the lead up to the end of June 2021 remind people that if they haven't applied they really need to and that if they don't it could make it harder for them to find a job or rent a flat, among other more serious consequences.\nNC: Yeah I can see that's really important advice there. So let's move over to Marina Fernandez-Reino, the big change here is the move to a points-based immigration system, these are used in one form or another in various countries, can you just explain the landscape, remind us how this works and how it will change things?\nMF-R: So actually even though the government call this a new system, a points-based system, it's actually not a points-based system as such because usually points-based systems are not employer-led, that is the worker doesn't need to be sponsored by an employer in order to come to a country it's just that he has certain characteristics that the country deems attractive, so this migrant is accepted. So that's typically how points-based systems work. In this case the UK system is a typical employer-led system, you need to be sponsored for a job in order to come to the UK. You cannot come with an offer for a middle skill or a high skilled job. So in this case it continues to be the same as the previous system the main difference, as Ian has said, is that it changes completely the rules for EU migrants because they will be now subject to immigration controls, they will need to come to the UK with an offer, as non-EU migrants did before. The main difference to the previous system is that now non-EU migrants, so those from outside of the European Union, they will be able to come more easily because the requirements for coming to the UK are lower down. In this case they no longer need to be sponsored for a graduate level job, so some middle skilled jobs you are able to come on a work visa to the UK and also the salary requirements have been lowered, compared to the past years. So before it used to be PS30,000, now it's PS25,600. So probably what we will see, although very difficult to do forecasts in terms of immigration flows, is that there will be an increase in non-EU immigration and a decrease in EU migration.\nNC: Gerwyn Davies do you have a view on that? How is this going to change the mix in the workforce during 2021 and going forward? Overlaying it of course is COVID with so many employers at the moment just unsure about their labour needs.\nGD: Yeah well it's very difficult to foresee the future because of the variables thrown up by the pandemic but one thing we do know is that demand is likely to be a lot lower than it already would have otherwise been, due to the pandemic, because of the limited bandwidth that employers have, management time, depressed demand for workers - we've seen vacancies fall to a record low in recent months and while that has recovered it's still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. And we've also got this issue of the job retention scheme and job support scheme. So there's a fight to save jobs rather than to recruit new workers. So the pressures on the new system in January are far less than they would have been if you'd have asked me that question this time last year.\nBut looking ahead I think it's still inevitable that we will see lower migration due to the restrictions and that's because of the cost and administrative burden that is involved in recruiting overseas workers and what we'll see is a shift in the composition of migrants towards more highly skilled professionals and to a lesser extent medium skilled professionals and away from low skilled workers, simply because there is no route for low skilled workers apart from the prospect of a youth mobility scheme, the outcome of which is still yet to be decided because it's part of the Brexit negotiations as we speak.\nNC: Ian Robinson in the light of all that, I mean a new immigration rule book, okay a bit of a breathing space now because of the pandemic and so on, but I mean this may be great for lawyers, legal companies like yours, huge amount of paperwork, what is your sense of how prepared, how aware people managers, employers, are about all this and how it has to be dealt with and basically how you can use the immigration system to make your workforce as good as it could be.\nIR: When we speak to clients more often than not our clients are prepared but of course our clients spend a lot of time thinking about immigration. When we've surveyed other employers only about 20% of them feel like they are ready, the IT sector, in particular, feels more prepared than most; hospitality too, but many, many employers just aren't ready. There is so much for them to get through but it is possible in the time that we have. The first step is to workforce plan. The biggest decision is do you need to recruit Europeans and non-Europeans in future? They also need to be budget planning, UK immigration is so, so expensive, if we were to sponsor a single person for three years that would be about PS5,500 in government fees alone. If they were married with three children coming for five years that would be PS27,000 in government fees - big, big cost attached that you need to be ready for.\nAnd then it's about making sure that your recruiters and your line managers and others in the business understand what's coming, the extra friction, the extra cost and then to some extent extra delay although the new system will be a lot quicker than the current non-European immigration system.\nAnd then taking decisions such as will you allow if you're already sponsoring migrants your temporary assignees with ICT visas, an intra-company transfer visa, a visa that allows a person from an overseas entity to transfer to the UK? Right now they are capped at five years but they will be able to move into a new visa category and stay permanently. Is that something that you want to encourage and allow? Do you want to use the intra company transfer category at all in future, because whereas now we have about 30,000 coming into the country every year because it's quicker that tier 2 generally and easier for various good reasons, it will be just as quick and just as possible to use the skilled worker visa and keep people permanently.\nFinally think about your right to work. For the first six months of next year you will just need to see that a person is European but are you also going to check that they have the right to work because if not a year, three years, ten years from now it may turn out that they don't and all of a sudden they've realised, they learn that they're here illegally and can't get any job, can't rent a flat, can't access healthcare. The sorts of issues that we saw with Windrush.\nMF-R: That's a relevant issue and one of the main challenges of the EU Settlement Scheme. I mean the EU Settlement Scheme has been highly successful in that there has been, I think, 3.7 million applications. There are always certain groups of people that are not going to apply and this could be for several reasons, some people are more likely to miss the deadline, some others with particularly vulnerabilities, personal or social vulnerabilities that make them less likely to apply or to be aware of the scheme. So obviously we might have this problem in the future because in theory all the EU migrants that are currently living in the UK that do not apply they will become irregular migrants after June 2021 so they won't have the right to work or to rent or to access the NHS. So at the end even if the programme is very successful, so imagine 95% of people register in the EU Settlement Scheme if only 5% do not register this could mean thousands of people not registered. What is going to happen with these people in theory? The Home office at the moment say that people who miss a deadline will be able to apply if they good reasons for not applying but we still don't know what that means and how lenient they are going to be in accepting late applications. So that's important obviously for all employers to know that all their EU workers at the moment they need to apply to the scheme if they want to continue working.\nNC: So Gerwyn Davies how lenient do you think they'll be? Or I suspect you're going to say just don't test them out, get it sorted now.\nGD: Well certainly the discussions that we've had with Home Office officials suggest a real mindset change and that a lot of leniency will be applied to cases. A lot of resources have been put in, in terms of the helplines that the Home Office have put in to help people with some of these challenges. So I think it's fair to say that the Home Office have learnt the lessons from the past and hopefully that will lead to a much brighter future.\nNC: And Gerwyn while we're with you just give us a bit more of a sense, we've already touched on this, but the differences we've been talking about labour from around the world as if it's homogenous but clearly we're talking about skilled, unskilled, semi-skilled jobs, the EU, the rest of the world if you like, I mean we've obviously had some experience of massive change with farm workers coming in from the EU, shortages of those, give us a bit of a sense across different business sectors and skills how things are going to shape out?\nGD: Well again the pandemic is leading to some big structural changes in the labour market so we're seeing permanent job losses in many of those low skilled sectors such as hospitality and retail and there's a big question mark over whether they return at all. So again compared with 12 months ago I think we're at a very different point in terms of trying to predict what the future changes will be. Nonetheless it is inevitable that there will be labour shortages at the low skilled end simply because there is no route for low skilled employment.\nAt the same time I think what we might see, while the government have been relatively generous I think in terms of the salary and skill thresholds we might see more employers decide that the administrative burden and the costs associated with the new system will mean that perhaps there's less gain to recruit for medium skilled occupations, areas such as lower management which they have been recruiting EU workers in particular for, and I think what we might see is perhaps a greater emphasis on high skilled work and actually see more immigration because of those structural changes we're seeing a lot more digital roles being created, so digital marketing and data analysts and those areas that we've got big skill shortages for. We're seeing big growth in areas such as green technologies where we've already got skill shortages despite the ample labour supply we have. And of course that adds to the existing list of skill shortages which are in traditional areas such as engineering, accountancy and all the highly skilled roles.\nI should add in terms of the regional impacts it also looks to have a particularly negative impact on London where we know there is a high concentration of migrants across all sectors, but of course because of that low skilled impact the impact will be most keenly felt among those low wage sectors.\nNC: It's almost Marina as if the hollowing out of our cities that we've seen because of the pandemic that's kind of almost being followed by a secondary effect in employment.\nMF-R: The main challenge we have to measure the effects of the change in migration policy is that we have the COVID crisis at the same time which is a huge economic crisis and it's going to accelerate many of the changes in the economy and the labour market that were already happening. Certain jobs in the hospitality sector, also in retail jobs, we don't know if these jobs are going to come back because people are increasingly, for example, buying online. And this process might have accelerated because of the pandemic. So how these things are going to evolve in the coming months it's a bit uncertain but it's probably certain jobs that are being very hard hit by the COVID probably we won't see I think jobs in these sectors coming back, at least in the next year.\nNC: Now one thing we can be certain of Ian is that millions more of us are working from home and if countless millions of us continue to do that, there's absolutely no sense that that won't be the case in 2021, it's almost as if events themselves are kind of weakening or overriding Brexit itself because in theory what people are saying is well what's to stop me just sending existing, or hiring new EU workers in their homes and they work for us from there? I guess you're going to say there are quite a lot of issues but on the face of it, it does seem like a bit of a loophole, what's the point of having Brexit we can just all work wherever we are?\nIR: Well interestingly when we've surveyed employers about 40% of them expect to do less business in the UK as a consequence of this and one of the solutions is that work can be done remotely from within Europe. We are also seeing a trend in governments towards nomadic visas. So Estonia has a digital nomad visa where people can go and work there for a year, have a lovely time of life but work remotely for a job in the UK for instance. Barbados are doing something similar which sounds very appealing this morning.\nNC: I've been to Estonia I can tell you it's extremely cold in the winter. I've not been to Barbados, I'm very happy to go on a fact-finding trip for you if you want. This is all just new thinking isn't it?\nIR: Yeah and I do think that you will see it more. We are spending a lot more time than ever before talking about commuters and people who work in the UK just during the week and need to work in Europe. We're having a lot more conversations about immigration in Europe, whether it's some of the trickier countries like Spain and Italy or the more welcoming countries such as Germany or the Netherlands. And that's as a consequence of several things but in particular the cost of the UK immigration system and the fact that it gives pause for thought before you bring people over here.\nNC: If we're going to keep the same EU workforce but just send them home I mean that sounds like a neat solution. I guess Ian there are going to be complexities and issues with regard to where they're domiciled, who they pay tax and various other dues to?\nIR: Yeah that's right and actually we're seeing this already as a consequence of COVID, people went home to spend time with their families when the pandemic first took hold and they haven't been able to return for logistical or personal reasons. And then employers are already facing difficulties with right to work, do you have permission to work in the country that you happen to be visiting, with tax, with payroll? And there is an extra level of complexity to remote working where it's overseas that employers need to take very, very seriously. I suspect though that the question will come up more often with, for instance, overseas employees who want to go back for Christmas and then spend the month of December working in Argentina, South Africa or wherever they may be. It's going to come up much more often over the next few months and years.\nMF-R: I mean working remotely can deprioritise let's say the legibility for permanent residence for EU workers, so imagine that you are now an EU worker and you've got the pre-settled status which is the less secure status that you get when you apply to the EU Settlement Scheme and you really been here for less than five years. So if, after December 2020, you leave to your country of origin because you might think that here the pandemic is getting worse and you just do your work remotely from there, if your absence is longer than six months then you might not be able to apply for settled status afterwards so at the end you need to start the process all together but as I said you lose your residency rights because the pre-settled status cannot be renewed. So I think probably workers, and Ian is probably more aware of this, but I don't know if all employers or all EU workers that have this less secure status are aware of the conditions in order to get permanent residence in the future.\nNC: Gerwyn do you think people managers are across that, clearly it's an issue as we've heard for the workers themselves but employers could unwittingly damage somebody's employment aspirations?\nGD: To be honest many won't be aware of those finer nuances but what I would say from a labour market perspective is that we've done research recently which shows that where possible remote working can be successful. The recent homeworking experiment has not led to an adverse impact on productivity and one of the reasons for that is that the communication challenges which this would have ordinarily have raised in years gone by have largely been overcome because of the new technologies, so people are able to hold weekly team meetings via Zoom or Microsoft Teams and as a result we've not seen the negative impact that one would have associated with this kind of pandemic.\nNC: It does though also raise Ian a slightly broader issue about the moral responsibility on employers if they're in a situation certainly of having to sponsor people it does kind of tie them to that worker in some ways. We've also just heard from Marina there that if employers don't fully understand the implications of say a bit of homeworking or establishing an early relationship and then finding they can't bring the people back, do you think that employers are going to have to be more concerned about those sort of moral questions when they're trying to bring people in?\nIR: To begin with employers are going to need to be much more concerned about compliance questions. Sponsoring an overseas worker is reasonably straightforward once you have a licence but afterwards any change in circumstances needs to be reported to the Home Office. You need to make sure that a person's visa doesn't expire. You have a duty of care to your employees to ensure that they understand their entitlement to permanent residence and so on, and to ensure that they aren't lost, to Marina's point earlier. So employers will find that they need to spend a lot more time thinking about this for their sponsored workers. If they're going to be recruiting Europeans from outside of the UK next year, or indeed non-Europeans they will need a sponsor licence and I can't stress how important that is.\nThere's also the question, and I'm asked this an awful lot interestingly by the farming sector, do we need to make sure that our employees have actually applied for settled status or pre-settled status under the Withdrawal Agreement? And the answer in pure legal terms is no you don't, certainly as it stands there is no obligation to check that an employee has applied. In my opinion there is a duty of care owed by employers to their employees oftentimes simply because if a person doesn't apply their life could be turned upside down and the more you can do to educate them, to direct them, and make sure that they know what is needed, the better. If you don't, if you don't know who your Europeans are that will make it harder but the more information you can make available the better - CIPD will have good information, the Home Office has a good employer toolkit, other providers too. Just try and help people would be my view.\nNC: Marina from your work at the Migration Observatory I just wonder whether experience other countries have had when they've changed their immigration systems, other flows around the world, do they give the UK any clue as to what the future might hold?\nMF-R: I'm thinking now for example a major immigration programme that was implemented in my country about 50 years ago when there was a regularisation programme for almost a million irregular migrants, so they have the opportunity to register and be let's say legal in the system. So it was in a sense highly successful because obviously it was in the interest of migrants to register but even though not all of them registered, not all of those who were eligible registered, so the irregular migration programme was not completely solved by this programme but it certainly helped. I think that in this case this is certainly a major change and the fact that this major policy change is occurring in a moment where there is also a major economic crisis unfolding it's problematic.\nIR: In terms of experience of such an overhaul of an immigration system I tend to think of a few years ago in Australia where they reviewed their 457 programme which was their work permit programme, huge amount of disruption. When President Trump brought in the travel ban back in 2016, huge amount of disruption. Reform in China, big disruption. When this is happening the key components to your response are going to be good data; know who your people are; know what they're doing, what they're paid and what it would cost you to bring them in, in future; good communications to the business so that they understand what is happening, where the changes are, but also so that you can manage expectations; and then finally advocacy, make sure that government understands the issues that you are facing and then they're more likely to be resolved. How you do that if you're a big company is very different to if you're a small company but actually this is where nobody gets into the building with the Home Office as quickly as CIPD can, given the relationship, and if this isn't a hostage to fortune Gerwyn but the more you can feed into your local representatives the better I would say.\nGD: One quick point on the point about influence in the Home Office you'll see in various government reports that the CIPD has been a vocal presence and a key influence on the future direction of government policy and we will be evaluating its impact next year as part of our role and look to identify some changes that government could make. So for instance one of them that we think they could be and should be looking at is the idea of umbrella sponsorship organisations. So that would be an overarching body like a membership body that could free employers with some of the compliance pressures, not least because one of the things they tell us is that they really fear making a mistake, so they can have that level of reassurance that an organisation like the CIPD or whoever, the CBI, can offer.\nBut to add to Ian's wise words on what organisations can do the only thing I would add is the greater need to focus on internal development and look at the wider range of options other than just immigration, the debate around immigration has been too narrowly focused on recruitment difficulties and skill shortages and we haven't looked at the panorama of options that include automation, but especially internal development. While we've seen immigration levels increase over recent years we've seen public funding in skills fall, we've seen employer funding for skills fall and with the more public funding as we've seen the government announce a skills guarantee to help people embrace lifelong learning. It's also employers' responsibility to help the retention issues that have undoubtedly contributed to some of the recruitment difficulties through things like apprenticeships which have been falling alarmingly over the last couple of years and again if I was in Whitehall one of my asks to government would be the need to reform the apprenticeship levy and turn it into a training levy so that organisations have more flexibility to train the workforce and invest more in skills.\nMF-R: Well yes but this is more a change that will occur in the medium, long-term. At the end there needs to be probably a coordination between employers and the policy initiatives for the government in order to upskill the labour force and to automate certain process and rely less on labour for certain processes. But it's true also that for certain sectors, I'm thinking now the social care sector, it's difficult sometimes, these sectors are heavily reliant on migrant labour, especially cheap migrant labour because the salaries are very low and it's likely to be like that in the short-term. I mean some sectors are likely to continue relying on low paid migrant labour in the short term, so I don't see how there can be dramatic changes in the short-term.\nNC: And a final thought, maybe a bit of advice from you Ian?\nIR: Well really I suppose this really just emphasises why it's so important to workforce plan. So there will be a temptation, certainly at the moment to think tactically, headcount plan, fill the vacancies that need filling as you go along. If you can use this time to reflect on your workforce and think about where you can build by bringing in younger people who are available in the labour market, where you need to borrow. And then immigration essentially becomes an issue when you need to buy in skills really in most instances. Workforce plan, look at costs, look at need and try and get the balance there so that you have diversity but also making the most of the people who are available to you now.\nNC: Well that's it. If you heard our last podcast we considered drug and alcohol abuse, touching among other things on the controversial idea of testing employees. Afterwards Jayne Brownlee of the Alcohol and Drug Service drew attention to some useful case studies and other info they have online; I was particularly struck by their urging to approach any testing from a health and safety perspective rather than the risk to an individual. She says you can too easily get caught up in arguments about the rights and wrongs of the legal status of one substance against another.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:30:27\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: What can we and what should we do to help colleagues turning to drink and drugs to get through the working day? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nIt's true most of us are stressed to some degree with the ever present worries of a new autumn wave of the pandemic and the UK well into official recession it's no wonder that studies show we're drinking more. That's true of furloughed workers especially. Others turn to pills, prescription or otherwise. Pleasant habits can become props. All the signs are this is going to get worse. We need to quickly understand how employment conditions do seem to be playing a part in driving workers to misuse alcohol and drugs. But when and how is it appropriate to intervene and what testing and support should be readied and provided by employers through their people managers?\nWell with me Professor Dame Carol Black who's advised the government on health, work and wellbeing. She authored an independent review into employment outcomes of drug or alcohol addiction four years ago and has continued to advise governments in this area. Hello.\nCarol Black: Great to be with you.\nNC: We've Simon Jones who's had long experience in senior personnel and people management roles in public transport and large organisations. He's co-authored the CIPD's very latest managing drug and alcohol misuse guidance and is a director of Ariadne Associate. Hello.\nSimon Jones: Hello\nNC: And from the home team the CIPD's own senior diversity and inclusion adviser Dr Jill Miller who works closely with policymakers, officials and HR professionals. Hello to you.\nJill Miller: Hi there.\nNC: Now Carol Black in those halcyon days BC, before COVID, most of us looked forward to an after work drink or two, maybe near the office, now clearly we're all taking our drugs of choice mainly at home. It's how millions of us deal with stress or anxiety isn't it, but from an employer's point of view can we say when those personal habits move from being a private issue to one for employers?\nCB: If it interferes or impinges on your work then obviously it's a matter for the employer, but I think it goes beyond that. I think most employers, or good employers want to have a well and contented and healthy workforce and this is a whole area that's been swept under the carpet. So it's not one, we talk about mental health at work now very easily, it's something we try to do something about openly, positively, CEOs talk about maybe the depression they had or their period of anxiety because so often with drugs and alcohol because of the stigma the employers, if anything, are a little bit defensive and I want to see drug and alcohol problems treated like a health condition, so that you would treat the employee as you'd treated somebody who had diabetes. You would be proactive and positive. I think the report will go a long way to help us get there.\nNC: One in 11 adults have taken a drug in the last year, that's 3.2 million people, it's a lot it's one in five for 16 to 24 year olds. And is there something about how we've been forced to work for most of this year that is somehow fuelling the increase in this kind of dependency?\nSJ: I think there may well be an element of that, I mean the whole lockdown situation has made it quite difficult for people, people who have been furloughed are effectively sitting around with nothing very easy to open a bottle of wine or perhaps in some cases take some sort of substance. Equally those who are working, working from home they don't have the social interaction with colleagues and they sometimes need that prop to help them. I mean I'm aware of some people who are working probably far longer hours that they would do because they're at home, they've got distractions perhaps with childcare or whatever so they're working late into the night. And it's understandable in that respect that they're using some of the other ways of relaxing if you like because there aren't other options open to them.\nNC: But Jill Miller it is a kind of moot point isn't it as to whether it's employers essentially who are responsible for this, I mean life is stressful, work can be difficult, so what's your sense of the extent to which employers are responsible for people's wellbeing here, particularly when life is difficult under COVID?\nJM: I think I'd echo Carol's earlier point to say that forward thinking and responsible employers are thinking about the wellbeing of their staff. They're having a drugs and alcohol policy in place, they're reminding people, especially during these really difficult times that Simon's outlined of the kind of support that can be available. But I think this does raise that really important point of this is now just a disciplinary issue of when we're talking about drug and alcohol misuse, this is a real central wellbeing issue. And I think even though there's going to be circumstances where disciplinary action may be necessary it shouldn't necessarily be the default position whenever substance abuse is identified. I think a concern for an individual's wellbeing really should be the priority whatever the formal action being taken.\nNC: So you're implying there Jill that there has to be some kind of policy in place which is clear, that people can see?\nJM: Yeah I think we would definitely recommend that employers do have a drug and alcohol misuse policy in place and I think that should reflect the balance we're talking about between the need for any disciplinary action that sets clear expectations about employee behaviour and the consequences of contravening that. But also it's got to prioritise this genuine support of wellbeing because I think if people see that angle they're more likely to come forward, disclose an issue and that's when employers can take that preventative action, offering them support, signposting them to professional help, because employers mainly aren't placed to provide that support themselves they need to be signposting externally and enabling people to get professional support. And I think there's clear benefits for doing that.\nCB: I mean the real worry to me is the big increase in powder cocaine in the young, 19 to 24 year olds is the biggest increase. It's usually the young, white male where it's increasing now, just to come back in a way to what you've just mentioned, that is often under the radar, maybe only once a week, maybe about 10% will take it daily. It's a worry that it is absolutely a statistical increase as well as cannabis, which of course a lot of people do and have used. But when you're working from home there are lots of competing factors in your life aren't there? I mean you may well, well if you're a woman you've probably been doing the schooling, you've been doing the housework and you've been trying to hold the family together. You may have some caring responsibilities and you've been trying to do a job. I think for quite a lot of people, and I'm sure for some men, their income may have been affected, there may be financial worries, there may be lack of sleep or quality of sleep. This has all maybe become just too much and either you may find it much easier at the end of the day when you're actually in your own home just to have that extra glass of wine or think some sort of pill, whether it's a prescribed pill or a not prescribed pill,  may be helpful. And you may think you can control it, I think, which is interesting. You may think this is just temporary, don't need to do anything about it. But I think as has just been said if the employer can make known that there are policies and there is support and if you have got a problem if you can only find a manager who's been well trained and can understand these issues, and that's a really important point, you can start to do something about it.\nNC: It's interesting you're starting to mention specific drugs of choice, or indeed they may not be a choice but people get sucked into using, particular drugs, I saw quite a useful list, it turned up in a report I saw about the 600 soldiers and reservists who were discharged last year after testing positive for illicit substances, of course clearly these were people who were at work who were turning to drugs, mostly cocaine which I think leaves the body within a couple of days, followed by, as you say, cannabis, ecstasy, ketamine, steroids, benzodiazepines, I mean this list goes on, Simon Jones what's your experience tell you about how people get suckered into using some of these products and the sort of approaches that employers take when they find out this is going on?\nSJ: Well I think, to take the second question first, I think the natural reaction of most employers historically has been to take it as a disciplinary matter and I think that's where we need to be kind of moving the conversation and the debate away from that. I think the big issue really is that certainly managers, HR managers, are much less aware of the impact of drugs. There tends to be a perception of the media stereotypes of what a drug user  looks like, and from that point of view people don't understand the impacts and the effects and as you say some drugs are through the system very quickly, others hang around for a long while, can have a long impact, whereas alcohol I think we're all a bit more familiar with because it's legal, it's much more socially acceptable, so we know what the symptoms are, the signs are, what we should be looking for etc. etc. And I think just to build on something Carol said earlier it's interesting that, I think I read a statistic that around a third of young people 16 to 24 year olds don't drink these days but they are far more likely to be taking some sort of substance, maybe smoking a joint of cannabis or whatever. And I think that's something that certainly managers need to be much more aware of. They need to educate themselves much more in the effects of drugs, the types of symptoms to look out for and to consider it, as we've been saying throughout, much more as a wellbeing issue.\nNC: Well Jill you've already made this point that you feel this is a welfare question not, as we've been hearing, a disciplinary one, so if employers are going to be proactive take us a bit of a stage further, other than having policies in place how do they start intervening? They may just get a report that somebody's performance is down, or somebody may have told them something, how do you get involved, particularly when somebody is not physically in the office?\nJM: Well I think to start with I'd say that there's a whole host of scenarios that line managers and HR are going to be faced with, are going to have to deal with and this comes from things like one-off incidents, accidents where it's suspected someone might be under the influence. We've talked about under-performance as well where someone might be struggling. Or it could just be general concerns about someone's wellbeing. But I think across the whole host of scenarios where an issue is suspected it should be addressed because of what we're talking about with the wellbeing nature of things. And it may be that disciplinary action is needed. It might be a key safety concern as well but we need to make sure we're dealing with things in the appropriate way and that will very much depend on the circumstances and the context in which things happen.\nNC: And just remind us of the legal position, you can't force somebody to take a test can you?\nSJ: Certain industries it's a requirement, for example the railways, airlines etc. it is a requirement as part of the employment conditions that people are tested regularly.\nNC: And in fact Simon that does highlight the point that maybe the need to intervene or how you intervene is going to vary according to the industry or sector that you work in?\nSJ: I think that's right in most of the case, I think as Jill highlighted earlier anything that's safety-critical you have to take a far more proactive approach to choices like that. You mentioned earlier that I used to work in public transport and one of the things that we used to have as a company rule was you couldn't drink within eight hours of starting your shift if you were a driver. Now that meant in some cases if you were on the early morning shift you couldn't go to the pub with your mates the previous evening and we would, on occasions if there was any suggestion that somebody had been we would test people or take them off the road and suspend them. Now that's obviously because of the safety nature and you wouldn't apply that necessarily in every environment, you have to consider the safety aspects. If somebody appears to be in a condition where they can't work safely then obviously you'd have to take action there and then.\nNC: Now Carol Black I don't know whether you saw the other day the Conservative Party candidate for London Mayor, Shaun Bailey, was urging larger businesses to routinely test their staff for narcotics, is that a practical suggestion? Is it even workable for employers to test people?\nCB: I'm not sure whether it's workable but I don't think that's a route any of us would really want to go down. I mean surely, just building on what Simon says, your best chance of helping somebody with these problems is early on. So you want an environment at work where the person will say, 'I'm in a safe environment I can go to my line manager, I can say I've got a problem. I will be signposted, helped.' There may be something even within the company, in a people programme that is suitable. It may need more. It's that early intervention with any condition you can think of, whether it's drugs, alcohol excess, whether it's cancer, getting in there early with the right approach is your best chance of helping someone so they don't have problems later on and I haven't looked at Twitter to see the response to that article in The Times but I would imagine that it's been quite vivid. I would think so.\nJM: Yeah I think a central theme about what we're talking about here is the key role of line managers and employees feeling they can approach their line manager to discuss an issue or to ask for some support. And I think, given the whole host of situations that line managers could face and need to deal with they need to feel really capable and confident to do that. They need to have that training, as well as the support from HR to deal with some really tricky issues. But our CIPD survey actually found that just 12% of organisations provide one-off training to line managers, and just a quarter, so 25%, provide regular training. If we go a bit further than that, just a third invest in improving management practice, so really supporting managers in how to effectively manage and support people more generally. And that's despite HR professionals telling us that developing line managers' capability is the really effective way of preventing drug and alcohol misuse. So I think we would urge employers really to be investing here in their line managers, given that they have such a pivotal role.\nSJ: Yes I'd agree. I think in one sense there's a danger that it could be just another thing that we have to train line managers in. And I think it's probably better in some respects if we think of it as part of our overall line manager development, their management styles, their approachability, if you like their willingness to lead the team effectively and to recognise when team members have issues and problems, it doesn't have to be necessarily drugs and alcohol it could be a personal issue, it could be anything really, but it's about developing that empathetic style I think is the key thing, rather than just saying, oh well today it's equality and diversity, tomorrow it's drugs and alcohol, the day after it's mental health, or whatever, it's rather than boxing things off like that looking at it much more from a management style point of view. I was also going to add I think just to build on Jill's comment, I think one of the things, particularly with this area is that HR people need to educate themselves as well. There's a lot of lack of knowledge in the HR profession about things like drugs and alcohol and we can't really support line managers or expect them to be alert to potential problems if we ourselves don't know a great deal about those issues and the effects and the signs and symptoms to look out for.\nNC: Jill we've been talking a lot, and you've been emphasising the importance of helping the individual but in terms of businesses, clearly when people are below par, when they're using substances they're not often going to be very productive, in terms of the damage to the business the pressure is to act more quickly and that of course may not be the best solution for somebody if they end up getting suspended or something?\nJM: I think a lot of the problems we're talking about are significant issues in people's lives and the really tough times that people are dealing with, so I think businesses do need to be proactively thinking about how they can effectively manage and support people and we need to be doing that straightaway, not just waiting for when an incident happens or when there's a health and safety issue or when there's a wellbeing concern. But we know that one in five employers are not offering proactive support to workers and support issues of drug and alcohol misuse and I think businesses do need to be looking at this because we know drug and alcohol misuse is a significant issue in UK society and therefore it's also going to be an issue across UK workplaces.\nCB: So for smaller companies this is really difficult and I wonder how do we help them do these things when it might not be quite so easy. So I think for a larger company there will be more people around and possibly more resources to enable the manager to be capable but it worries me that we have lots of middle size and smaller companies and they even find it difficult to do the sort of things we want done if you like on general wellbeing and mental health. So this is an added dimension and I don't think we should forget that.\nNC: Simon jones what do you think about that be we all know some managers who shouldn't be let anywhere near employees, particularly when they've got intractable personal difficulties?\nSJ: Well I think that's a different issue which we could probably spend a good couple of hours discussing about management capabilities generally, but I think the point with smaller companies is again it's making them aware of where they can get support. And I think very much focusing it as part of the general mental health and wellbeing approach. Even smaller companies these days are aware that they need to be doing something about mental health and general staff wellbeing, even if in practice they don't do huge amounts of it they're aware it's something they should be doing. And I think if you include drugs and alcohol, because in a lot of cases they're actually symptoms of broader mental health problems. And I think from that point of view, again rather than saying this is another thing you need to worry about, if you include it as part of that general approach to wellbeing and mental health I think  that's a much more effective way of doing it. And small organisations can manage that. The other thing I've found working with smaller organisations is often they take a much more person-centred approach to the organisation because it's somebody that they will know quite well because they're a small organisation and people tend to work more closely together. So you may sometimes get a much more sympathetic approach from a smaller business because it's somebody they may have worked with for a long while, they know they've relied on for a number of years etc. etc. So from that point of view it's not small firms can't or won't do it it's sometimes they will actually take a much more proactive approach to it.\nNC: I know Carol Black in your report you looked at the various ways companies try to deal with this and were helping the government to try and improve it across the piece. What's the essential difference between those employers, those organisations that are really bad at helping people and those that have got to grips with it?\nCB: I think they're not thinking proactively, they may have something in place which will go more down the disciplinary line but a good company will have made it clear that as much as they're there to support people's mental health, carer responsibilities, if they've got any problems with domestic violence at home, they will also have put alcohol and drugs in there. There'll be this knowledge that is permeating the organisation that there are a whole host of issues that if you can be open and seek help. And I think that requires, as we've said, so much about that message and then the line manager capability and it may be that you need to refresh that because I think as was said earlier you could send someone on a training programme but they might not meet the problem for another year and so it's again how do you keep this refreshed; where do you have your policies and are they written in a way that's really acceptable and, if you like welcoming so you know the positive things that need to be done? I think to wait until you've got the problem and then you might react, as you say Nigel, rather quickly and perhaps not so appropriately, these are difficult, delicate issues.\nNC: Simon you mentioned earlier for example the bus drivers that aren't allowed to have a drink the day before their going to work, if we had more organisations with much clearer rules, even if people thought they might be a bit draconian might that actually reduce this rising tide of drug and alcohol abuse?\nSJ: I think the issue is really whether it's seen as acceptable, it's that boundary between where is an employer interfering, if you like, with somebody's personal life as opposed to the need for it to be safety critical. So I think the issue is very much if people understand why there is a very draconian rule people are going to accept it. If they can't see a need for a rule and it just seems to be the employer putting in rules for rules sake or trying to interfere with people's social lives I think it'll be much less acceptable. So although I haven't got any direct evidence I think where people understand the need for a rule it's generally followed and they also understand the consequences of it not being followed.\nNC: So Jill Miller you've already referred to the fact more than once that this is a welfare question more than a disciplinary one so how do organisations go about improving the way that they watch people's backs if you like, the way they help them without being too intrusive about it?\nJM: I think that's a really good question because there is an awful lot that employers could do and I think there's a lot they can do no matter what size they are or what resources that they have behind them. There are some key things that HR can focus on. I think one of them we've  mentioned already which is to encourage disclosure by promoting that real supportive environment, telling people about the support on offer and reminding people as well about it and the line manager's role in having those regular catch ups with people. I think line managers are often people's connection with the organisation so asking people some quite open-ended questions about their wellbeing can help, or give people that opportunity really to ask for support no matter what their issue is.\nNC: And do you think it makes any difference if people are in their own homes rather than in an office where obviously it is easier to keep an eye on somebody?\nJM: I think it's even more important if people are working remotely for line managers to be having those kind of catch ups because as you say when people are working remotely we don't see them every day. But there's other things I think employers can do to encourage people to actually seek help which is giving them time off to get that help, giving them flexibility to attend appointments like if they need to go to mutual aid meetings or see health professionals. But as well one thing we did talk about right at the beginning is around the work-related risk factors that has been associated with substance misuse, things like workload stress and whether the nature of the work is fuelling drinking culture, so if there's a lot, for example, of client entertaining expectations, or if you feel that to get noticed at work you have to be at after work drinks down the pub. There's those kind of peer pressure things going on.\nNC: Is that still around at the moment with COVID and so on?\nJM: I think that's a really good point because I think at the moment obviously there's the pause on the social events, this is a really good time to be thinking about the kind of social events your organisation holds, do the centre all around alcohol and how much do you think about wellbeing, like is there soft drinks, how do people get home safely.\nNC: This is a really good time to recast that, I mean in theory there should be less abuse not more.\nJM: Well I think there's the wellbeing issue around social events but there's also the inclusion angle as well in that our survey found that a quarter of HR professionals said some people don't go to social gatherings because of the expectation to drink. I think there's many different reasons why people may choose not to consume alcohol.\nNC: I think there's another whole programme in that, these ways of being excluded that we don't even think about. And we should say there's a huge amount of guidance notes on the CIPD website. Carol Black from your point of view as we try and draw this together, we've already touched on what you've had to say about employers and how they tackle all this I mean what could be done that would try and stem this worrying trend?\nCB: Well I think first of all from an employer's point of view I really want to see a change in how they view this problem. I think often it is not viewed as a health issue, as I said you often stigmatise and therefore it is not always easy for the worker to really say that they're having this problem, whereas I think they've got better at saying, 'I've got a mental health problem,' and often mental health and alcohol and drugs go together. So I think there's a cultural issue here. There's something about the organisation and its culture and if you can't change that, just changing processes may not be enough. So I think you do know that, you need everything that Jill has said of what an employer can do. And I think it's got to be so visible and I think we're not there yet. And even though we don't think of these people as like the people dying on the street of heroin and crack, we still stigmatise them once we know about it and that is something that I want to see change.\nNC: Okay well thanks for that. And Simon Jones quite a lot of your points as mentioned there just give us one or two of them in conclusion.\nSJ: Well as I said earlier I think one of the things is that people, in HR particularly, need to educate themselves about some of the issues and as Carol said there is a lot of stigma around and we do tend to bring in sometimes our own personal views and prejudices about, particularly drugs, when we're trying to deal with these situations. And I think also it's look at other areas of support, you don't have to be the expert on everything, you know use occupational health, use your employee assistance programme, use drug and alcohol charities who do have expertise in that area and will be able to guide you.\nNC: Particularly important for small firms there.\nSJ: Particularly yes.\nNC: They don't have all those other officials, all those other professionals available.\nSJ: And particularly for small firms, but I think even in larger firms the charities that do work in this area in particular will be more than happy to advise employers because in a sense it potentially helps them avoiding getting a client in the future. So from that point of view I'm sure they would be happy to assist in that whatever the size of the firm. But yes as you say small firms particularly can benefit from using those external resources. Nobody would expect them to have them all internally. Obviously building on the wellbeing approach, but in particular if you do get a case, and they are quite rare, don't go in with preconceived ideas, you need to find out what the issue is that's causing the underlying problem and deal with that and try and deal with it sympathetically as possible, where you can, recognising that occasionally it might have to result in disciplinary action.\nNC: That's a very good point to end on. I'll just mention in the last podcast we were talking about workplace monitoring, is surveillance becoming the new norm and what should you be careful of. Interesting to see that since our last discussion the UK Information Commissioner's Office has just started investigating something we mentioned on the podcast of Barclays use of tracking software to monitor how long employees were away from their desks and how much time they were spending on particular tasks. It just shows we do try to keep our finger on the pulse and keep you across the big current issues for people managers. So do have a listen to that last edition, if you haven't already and do tell your friends about this podcast. Please subscribe so you never miss and episode.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:31:48\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Is it okay to use tech to track workers? Getting staff surveillance wrong risks causing stress and anxiety and maybe losing people's trust for good. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWould you believe not far short of half of workers think they're being monitored, that's one of the CIPD's findings, but now COVID-19 has driven vastly more of us to work on screens from home well the signs are that surveillance is being ramped up. Employers have to somehow get a grip on what we're all doing on productivity.\nNow you might say managers should have the authority to get the job done yet what rights do they have to follow our every move when we're not in the office but in our own homes? Well in this podcast we're assessing the use, and maybe the abuse, of employee surveillance. What are the boundaries?\nWith me the CIPD's former head of research Edward Houghton, he was behind the organisation's recent report on all this and more in Technology and the Employee Experience. He's now head of research and service design at DG Cities. Hello.\nEdward Houghton: Hi there Nigel.\nNC: Dr. Stephanie Hare is a researcher and broadcaster with deep interest and indeed a book coming out on technology ethics. Among other senior roles she is a principal director at Accenture Research. Hello.\nStephanie Hare: Hello.\nNC: And to help give our conversation an international dimension we're delighted to welcome from the Bank al Etihad headquartered in Oman, the chief human resources officer, Daniel Sharaiha. Hello.\nDaniel Sharaiha: Hello there.\nNC: Now Edward no mistaking how technology has got us out of a hole as coronavirus rages worldwide, of course it's enabled millions of us to work at home or out on the road solo during the pandemic and I mentioned this figure about almost 50% of workers being monitored, how common would you say that workplace surveillance is right now? What sort of methods are we talking about?\nEH: Our survey showed us that about the majority of employees that we surveyed about 73% believe that these technologies could damage trust between workers and employers and about two in five, around 43%, expressed concerns that introduction of workplace monitoring would make it easier for their privacy to be violated. And so we see through the survey a real concern on the side of workers around these technologies in the workplace. And obviously for many of us our workplace is now our living room or our office at home and so real concern for workers. But to your question, how much is this happening for organisations? How many organisations are actually doing this? And this is one of the glaring gaps I think in data in that we don't really know the extent to which through the COVID crisis that monitoring and surveillance has been upped. But we do know that organisations are increasingly investing in technologies that allow or enable this to happen and we do know that organisations are increasingly looking to technologies around automation and AI to improve productivity, to better connect employees to one another and to support individuals to upskill. And so we know that these are things that are happening, that technology is supporting, but what we don't know yet is how much monitoring and surveillance is happening on the ground for employees but like I said employees perceive a real challenge for their own work and they do see it shaping their own practices and their relationships with their organisations that they work for.\nNC: Okay so Stephanie Hare we already used to check into the office with a lanyard maybe, we log onto our computers, our transactions are monitored, I mean quite often they have to be because of the regulations around the job that we do, but with no manager watching us at home is it reasonable to assume that these and other practices might be adapted to be used in the home? I mean in a sense what is the problem here?\nSH: Oh gosh there are so many ways that we can unpack that. So I think starting out we would have to ask first of all are you using your employer's devices or your own device? So if you are using your personal mobile phone or your personal laptop or desktop that's really different than if your employer has given you a dedicated device on which you would work. So I think right there you could be expected quite reasonably to keep your private life private and your personal use of technology more streamlined on your own devices than on your employer-given devices. So if you are working at a work laptop you know not to be looking at pornography, for instance, which we know many people do. And you would also expect if you have children that your children should not be using a work device, your children should be using a personal device. And that's a really clear cut way of looking at it. I think it becomes trickier though that because we're in a pandemic not everyone necessarily is set up for homeworking and not every employer will necessarily be making budget to equip all of their workers to have dedicated work devices. There's a real blurring of boundaries there.\nSecond, even when we went into the office simply badging in and out for instance, so that for security purposes you might need to have access to an area that you wouldn't want members of the public to be able to go to, or it was a way for your employer to see what time you arrive and leave and how long you take your lunch break. You could argue that those are part of the employer/employee relationship and there are a lot of people who would still say that is excessive but you can make an argument for that. That falls down again at home, when you're working from home your employer might still want to know that information but the problem is you might be making your child breakfast while fielding emails or on a work call or listening to a conference call. So are you working or on personal time or both? And it becomes really complicated because it's not just your data it's your family's data at that point as well. So I think employers would want to be very careful about the desire to get more information actually could expose them to greater risk because if they fail to keep that information secure and something, God forbid, happens, they could find themselves on the wrong side of a law suit.\nNC: Okay well maybe we'll go a bit more into the legal situation and what companies can do in a minute because you've raised some fascinating and important issues there but before we go any further let's bring in Daniel Sharaiha, just taking this on a simple level if I was in the office and I kept taking breaks my manager would see and it would be perfectly reasonable as a management issue for them to find out what I'm doing. Because I'm at home I'm still in firm's time so to what extent is the home now an extension of the office, given what we've already heard from Stephanie Hare about the fact that if it's my own equipment and my own life then there is some intrusion there?\nDS: It depends on the culture of the organisation. For me I think there's a balance between wanting what is the best for your organisation and monitoring all transaction and the best interest of the employees. Employee experience is very crucial. I think some organisations we overstep on that privacy aspect and we over-control, we over-record, we over-monitor what is going on with the employees, especially after the pandemic where a lot of people are working from home and you hear their children screaming in the background while making calls or meetings and so on. And I believe a proper HR in this time in the world would show some tolerance and some respect for people's privacies. Not everybody has a big home where they can have a private office and they shut down everything and they have this privacy for them. So many employees would have a smaller home were actually the office is in the kitchen and people are there all the time. So I think there is a balance between that and being an HR professional in our part of the world demands us to also be humane, it's human and humane resources and I think a lot of people miss out on that.\nNC: Let's take a few examples that have been publicised recently, Edward Houghton, most famously Barclays Bank was widely criticised weren't they earlier in the year for being caught piloting a scheme to protect individuals from overworking and raise general productivity, well that's what they called it. But employees told a newspaper they were frightened to go to the loo or to take a biscuit break. And we've seen PWC, the accountants, seen to offer facial recognition technologies to investment banks and asset managers. So all this is bubbling under isn't it?\nEH: It is bubbling under and I think these high profile stories have highlighted the key question that is what is the fundamental reason that you want to invest in these technologies, and if you were to invest in these technologies how will you ensure that they are going to be done with the people who are using them or being serviced by them in an appropriate manner, in an appropriate way that protects their rights but also provides them the support to be able to do their jobs better? And I think you speak to the experts in HR at the likes of Barclays and they will say, 'We did this for this particular reason and it was this reason around productivity and efficiency that was key to us,' and in the pandemic it's entirely reasonable for an organisation that's going to be suffering significant losses to try to maintain levels of productivity and performance throughout the crisis by implementing these technology types. But it needs to be done in a way in which employees are engaged throughout the process, that it's transparent and that it's done in a meaningful way where it actually enables employees to shape their own work practices better.\nAnd I think that's the really positive part for this technology it can really support and enable employees to better manage their time, to understand how effective they are in different circumstances, to work with their line manager, to think about development opportunities, should a technology show them that actually they're less productive when they're using a certain software type or programme. There are great opportunities here to really shine a light on better working practices but that has to be sold to employees and our data tells us from our survey and from our focus group work that employees are yet to be convinced about this technology and its impact. And that's what these high profile stories have showed us.\nNC: Well you've made the case for it there but Stephanie Hare there is this kind of sense of mission creep isn't there? I mean we've had Amazon and logistics companies experimenting with bracelets or harnesses which have safety functions, there are very good reasons for them they might, for example be off to tell if we are socially distancing when we're at work or taking the right hygiene precautions, but they could also be used to monitor what we're doing?\nSH: Yeah I think it's really interesting when we think about workplace surveillance to ask if this is for all workers or just some workers. Like is Amazon's Jeff Bezos allowing himself to be surveilled and having that data shared with all of his employees and shareholders and possibly the media who would possibly also like to know what he's getting up to? We could share with everyone and I guess the sceptic in me looks at this and goes, it's always top down, executives and managers are not the ones being surveilled it's workers and there are many ways that you could look at boosting people's productivity that don't involve surveilling them.\nAnd then there's this question of consent. So in an economy where we are watching all sorts of redundancies and underemployment conditions happening because we're in an economic crisis as well as a public health crisis there will be many people who will not feel empowered to object to these levels of surveillance because they frankly need a job, they have a family to feed and they've got rent or a mortgage to pay. Those people are going to be at a disadvantage compared to people who are better off or have more power in the workplace.\nSo already we're not just talking about technology any more we're talking about existing power structures, employer/employee relations etc. So I think we really need to push back on some of this and kind of look at this from the Hippocratic oath point of view of first do no harm. Are there ways that we could boost productivity without surveilling people? Absolutely. So why aren't we doing them? I mean sort childcare right there and you could improve productivity but we never do that.\nNC: Isn't the problem Daniel that it's kind of easier to try and solve problems with productivity by trying to micromanage people and it is then that you get this stress and anxiety among workers? You already alluded to it earlier and that maybe comes a bit before the loss of trust. How do you as a manager deal with this when maybe you've got to introduce these systems on behalf of your employers?\nDS: I believe that most HR policies they belong to 300 years ago where workers had no choice in life and their talent, work opportunities were not matching talent. I think in our work people are looking for somewhere to work with that actually respects them as employees and respects their value system and their privacy. I believe many organisations are still missing out a lot and I'm talking from a bank here right, but in our bank for example we show a lot of respect for our employees, we treat them like human beings not numbers and because of that we are considered an employer of choice in the country, in Jordan, but people know that they are valued here, they are respected as human beings and this will give edge to any organisation, bank or non-banks. I believe that HR should blow up their policies and look at workforce in a different manner where they are treating people like people not like machines or numbers or that aspect.\nNC: So that really involves managing up, I mean never mind looking after your people you're trying in that case aren't you to change the hearts and minds of the managers who issue these policies you then have to implement?\nDS: Actually no we create the policy, the policy making is done with HR and the business lines. So there is a lot of harmony in that. I believe it's more than that Nigel, I think surveillance, too much of it without the proper process for it, without employees knowing or very clear that HR, for that is in some countries in our part of the world, in the Middle East, it's illegal and I consider it unethical. It is not proper what is being done in most organisations. I know of some organisations they have a chip in the sales people's cards so they monitor every single step and if they go off route they would call them, 'Where are you?' and they would say, 'I went to have a coffee,' or, 'I'm in the bathroom,' or whatever, and some people they actually log and time every second of employees if they take any break and they investigate with them on that. Well I think this is good for like 200 years ago, not in our current time, where job enrichment is becoming more and more and depending on the skillset and the attitude and the engagement of employees.\nNC: I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you but Edward the reality is that this is unstoppable. We might think that that idea of a chip monitoring every single action and having the manager call you if you don't follow the right procedure is unfair, unreasonable but if we take something like the UK government's coronavirus the test and trace measures, I mean we might see workplaces routinely monitoring the health of their staff and we've already heard talk of concern about the fact that information monitored and centralised could be used for something else. So it's not always as obvious that this is even going to happen and I wondered to what extent people professionals need to be aware of this?\nEH: They need to be fully aware of this. They need to be enlightened to the challenges I think that are going to be coming very quickly towards them. So the CIPD conducted research in 2018 which looked at the role of HR in decision making around new technology and automation and found that HR was the least engaged and consulted in the design and implementation of new workplace technologies. So back then, and I think it would be similar now, there's a real issue in that technologies are being implemented from a strategic and an operational perspective by other functions without real consideration of the importance of a people perspective in those discussions.\nAnd so first off I think the profession really needs to step into that as an opportunity to bring the expertise that they can into those conversations to protect and enhance the voice of workers to be able to create these practices in a way that is productive and creates value for the organisation but also supports workers in a culture and in an organisational structure that works for them. And so I don't think it's inevitable and I think what we're seeing now with this technology that's being used through the pandemic is that it can be very supportive and constructive in this context but everything is contextual and I think it's important we really consider what kind of working environment we want to have in the future and I also think that workers are very savvy to this and they will consider their options of where and how they work on the labour market.\nObviously the currently labour market doesn't give much choice at the moment and that's a real issue in that, to Steph's point, low paid workers with low skills who are unable to move on the current labour market are subjected to these technologies and they have little voice and that's a real challenge and we really need to make sure that actually in a positive, in a healthy labour market and in a labour market which is going through crisis, all employees of any skill level or pay grade has the opportunity to shape their workplace in a way that is meaningful to them.\nAnd that's the role of the people profession. That's what HR professionals can do is they can consider how technology is being rolled out, who's been engaged in its development and design and what kind of support they can give to employees should they have any concerns and listening to those concerns and acting on them is I think a big role for the profession to play in the future.\nNC: Some of that's quite noble Stephanie Hare, that's all about best practice but you're all about using technology and harnessing it to get better work without some of these downsides so have you any thoughts about how we make sure we don't enter some kind of nightmare vision here but we can raise productivity and get people who are based at home, are scattered around, feeling part of the organisation and not just monitored and scared?\nSH: I think there is also the risk that if you surveil your employees overtly as opposed to covertly, and both of those things happen, if they know it and they don't like it and they don't buy in and they don't feel they can do anything about it what will end up happening is they will just spend lots of time finding ways to work around it and subvert the surveillance. So what's hilarious it's like the law of unintended consequences, you install this surveillance technology thinking it will boost productivity, instead your workers work less because they're spending time finding ways to work around that surveillance because it's just very natural, human beings if we go to behavioural psychology human beings don't like to be surveilled. We have a natural reaction against it and we fight it and anyone who has ever known a teenager will know this and indeed some of us have maintained that spirit throughout our lives.\nSo there's this question of instead I think if it were to be done in conjunction with workers the entire way through so that they helped to shape it and set the rules and again if everyone understood if you are using a work-issued phone, if you are using a work-issued device of any kind expect that to be surveilled. Here is our data retention, here's what we do with it, it goes through an algorhythmic auditing process, if you have a complaint this is how you would complain this is the redress.\nAll that has to be spell out it's the rules of the game that you would expect in civil society. And if they don't want it you're going to have problems in the same way that you would not wanting a change in pensions or parental leave or something, you're going to get aggro and that might be expressed through union action or walkouts or just simply employee churns, the minute the market returns you lose your best people because they just don't want to deal with this.\nSo again proceed with caution and proceed with buy-in and then actually judge, does it work or not? And there's nothing wrong with trying something and then saying, 'Do you know what we actually tried it and it didn't boost productivity so we dumped it.' That's okay too.\nEH: Well it's a relationship based on trust that goes both ways right? So I think that's critical in how we think about employees experience monitoring and surveillance but also how employers roll it out and the use, why they do it, what will be the use or the purpose of it? And I think it's really important we don't think about monitoring surveillance as blanket monitoring surveillance with no real purpose or need. For it to follow the guidelines around data protection it has to have a limited and stated purpose. Employees need to know that it's happening, they need to know that their data is being recorded, how it's gathered, for what purposes, for what reason and when and how it's going to be used and how it's destroyed, where it's stored etc.\nThey also need to understand actually the quality of that data and so there's also a question there for many employees about what quality this information is and obviously individuals need to be working in that trusting relationship that is both ways and stating how their working practices are working for them and it's a two-way relationship. But I think this harks back to the point that Steph made earlier in that this power dynamic means that unfortunately monitoring surveillance is weighted towards workers who have little voice or little opportunity to challenge these technologies when they are implemented.\nAnd so I think it's really important we don't lose sight of this idea or concept that the trusting relationship has two sides to it and it's important that we all recognise that in how we think and reflect on how these technologies are being rolled out. I think many of us can see this is really quite, we're at a very interesting and challenging time I think for the profession because we have to step into this and lean on our expertise but also showcase our voice and our knowledge of what makes a good workplace and I think this is the role that the profession can play and if the profession isn't strong enough to stand up for those kind of principles then this could become something that is rolled out quite significantly, subversively through technologies that we're all now using in our daily lives. Like many of us probably have a health monitoring technology attached to us right now measuring our heartbeat, ten years ago if you'd said to me that I would have that technology I would have said, 'No way I can't see a use for that, I don't want anybody measuring my heart rate.' But now I've been convinced, because this data is apparently useful for me and it does benefit me in my health and wellbeing.\nNow this is a slippery slope and we need to make sure that we're maintaining our principles and we're considering what that slope could look like in five or ten years' time. The pandemic has shown us actually how bad we are at predicting in some circles the future of work and so we need to go back to the drawing board and reconsider what this world of work could look like with monitoring and surveillance at its heart. And ask the question is that actually what we want?\nNC: You've mentioned specific technologies there, health ones, Stephanie Hare can you just talk a little bit more about the specific technologies we might see being deployed here? I know obviously facial recognition is a big concern of yours.\nSH: It could be your face, it could be your voice, it could be your keyboard and typing pattern. So you might log on thinking that you're going to game the system that's monitoring you but actually what it's doing is seeing if you move your mouse every so often, so it doesn't matter that you've logged on if you've walked away and are out in the garden sunbathing it's going to know you're not working or what it's been coded to consider work. Some of us are working in our brains and it doesn't look like we're doing very much but we're actually thinking and we haven't really figured out a way to monitor that, although I'm sure they'd love to attach electrodes to our brains if they could.\nSo there's those things but I think there's also this really interesting question about like you manage what you measure. So if you're measuring people's productivity based on time, so if I log in and I'm at my computer and I'm able to be measured being at that computer, moving my mouse and my camera's picking up my rapid eye movements and I'm staring at a screen for eight hours am I actually being productive or do we want to move to a different way of measuring value which would be something like results-driven? So if it takes me three hours to write this report or eight hours to write this report does it matter or does it just matter that I got the report done by Tuesday which was what we agreed with the client?\nAnd maybe it does and maybe it doesn't but I just think we have to be so careful what we're measuring and why. And of course again always remembering those unintended consequences. As an employer you would have to be so careful even doing things like measuring somebody's heart rate or having something on the device that could because you could be picking up signs that somebody's pregnant before they themselves know, or before they've told you. They may decide not to go through with that pregnancy and in the United States where your healthcare is linked with your employer status it's really dangerous to give employers health information because they will use that to not pay your health insurance in ways that are just hair raising.\nSo we have to be so careful. We think we're getting one thing, we think we're using voice measuring technology as an authentication measure but what we're actually doing is picking up a bio marker that this person is likely to get Parkinson's before they or their doctor could know it. So like scary stuff. Proceed with caution would be my suggestion for all of us in this 21st century world!\nDS: If I can quote from my favourite show The Simpsons where Homer Simpson once decided to have a chicken, just pick up on his work station and they have the nuclear meltdown because of that. I think if you over-monitor you're encouraging employees to become like chicken and work in that mindset. Even though some jobs might require close monitoring. For example, some organisations, especially banking, would like to log all customers visiting a branch because in some way you protect the employee in that aspect and that is respected and understood. I want to go back to Edward when he said whatever you do there is a process for that, you need to take approval, you need to let them know why you are doing this and how does that benefit. I think it can be done as long as it's clear what you're doing.\nNC: So let's try and bring this together and I think some of you have already hinted about best practice but let's go round asking, Edward first. A final thought from you on how you can try and ensure that new technology that's used to monitor or surveil people is the right technology and does not make people stress and upset and lose your trust?\nEH: So I'd say two things, one is back to basics what is the question you're trying to answer with the data that you're collecting? So what's the purpose of your data collection process and could you find that answer without collecting data through monitoring and surveillance? And I think that's an important place to start from when we're thinking about these new technologies. Attached to that is this idea of going into these conversations mindful of your knowledge and expertise but also leaning on the expertise of others in the organisation to support you to do that. And back to my point about CIPD research that showed that HR has little space to talk about this at the moment and not really engaged in decision making. I think that's really important and we need to overcome and I think that will improve the quality of these decisions.\nSecond I think I would say that employee voice and engagement throughout the entire process is critical and that really is where HR can bring a lot of value, engaging employees to not just reflect on the technology that's being implemented but also to try and co-create solutions using that technology and actually getting into the questions that are trying to be answered. And I think if you give the space to employees to talk about these issues from their perspective you will have a really useful conversation that won't just talk about the technology you'll talk about relationship at work, you'll talk about trust, you'll talk about productivity and performance, you'll talk about the quality of line management.\nSo I think all of this needs to be wrapped into a really clear and comprehensive engagement process with the workforce through comprehensive voice strategies and I think that's really critical through all of this. If you have little employee voice it's high risk to the organisation, it's high risk to employees and it's a slippery slope that needs to be avoided.\nNC: Okay and from outside the people profession, Stephanie Hare would you add anything here?\nSH: I'd really like to build on that point, this idea of trust and relationship which is that if you can find out what motivates your workers, what they are scared about and what they are hopeful for and where they get their value from, if you can then mine that as an employer you might be able to achieve some of your goals without having to take on surveillance technologies. There's probably other ways to crack this egg. So I think the more, I like to put in the humane and human resources piece a lot from Daniel as well, remembering that we're people at the end of the day, particularly in a crisis like the pandemic we need that human flexibility and no machine will ever understand that.\nNC: And Daniel Sharaiha can you really get all this to happen in a bank when basically every transaction, every move anybody makes has to be logged down?\nDS: Yes if it has a good culture. I think it's all about a business case. I think the business case we make as chartered professionals is that if you want happy customers you need happy employees for that.\nNC: Excellent well I must thank three more top guests on the podcast that was Daniel Sharaiha, Edward Houghton, and Dr. Stephanie Hare, thank you very much indeed to all of you. As always the CIPD has lots of online resources to help with bringing in new technology. Edward's already referred to his report and there's lots of advice, for example prioritising the voices of employees, we've heard about that, clearly explaining the purposes, the outcomes and boundaries of any monitoring. Some good checklists there. And providing informal spaces for team members to check on each other's wellbeing, something we haven't mentioned.\nBefore we go let me just mention the great and overwhelming response on social media to our last podcast on workplace racism. One experienced HR leader said it was insightful and refreshingly direct. Another liked how our guests rubbished the notion of unconscious bias and someone said they listened to the podcast three times.\nUntil next month from me Nigel Cassidy and all of us at the CIPD it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:32:21\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: The death of George Floyd at the hands of US police sparked global protests over systemic, persistent racism in society. So what's to be done to stamp out racism and prejudice in our workplaces? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nThat shocking video of Mr Floyd's last moments has raised deep concerns and the issues it's brought to the surface are very close to home. The Black Lives Matter movement's only underlined a desperate need for us to properly educate ourselves, to look beyond the all too familiar box-ticking exercises, to look deeper and start tackling the all too persistent bias in our workplaces. All the surveys show that it's leaving people of colour underemployed and under-promoted. So what do we do next?\nWell joining me on this month's very timely CIPD podcast we're delighted to be joined by the organisational psychologist, best-selling author John Amaechi. He leads whole teams of psychologists, behavioural scientists and business strategists helping clients deal with people challenges that get in the way of an organisation's performance. And another entry in his CV he's also a former NBA player. Hi John.\nJohn Amaechi: Hello.\nNC: We've Bernadette Thompson. She's deputy director at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government here in the UK. She's held a wide range of roles supporting the government, notably involving senior diversity and inclusion roles. Hello to you.\nBernadette Thompson: Hi, hello.\nNC: And we've Binna Kandola, also a diversity specialist he cofounded [sic] the book Racism at Work, the Danger of Indifference, and cofounded the business psychology firm Pearn Kandola. Hi Binna.\nBinna Kandola: Hiya.\nNC: Now John if I can start with you professionally I guess we pretend not to see race don't we, well probably privately too, we like to think that your procedures, our diversity and inclusion policies have taken bias out of the equation but clearly we've seen from events that isn't so.\nJA: Yes I mean I think it's one of the most dangerous things that we do, the concept of the colour blind society is so convenient it helps us to imagine that by simply ignoring something existed will somehow make its impact immaterial. And that to me is one of the big challenges because we're not dealing with just the problem of people who are overtly biased, the people who are in this case overtly racist. If the challenge for us all was simply the men, and it is normally men, who run through the streets yelling the N word then we wouldn't have a big problem to deal with because that is the kind of behaviour that a blunt instrument can deal with. The problem we have is well-meaning people who do not realise and are unwilling to embrace the wince and the discomfort of recognising that, something we've seen in the last few weeks the number of people who have said, 'Oh it's so difficult to talk to black people. It's so difficult to talk about race,' and they don't realise the implication of that is the fact that they have spent 30, 40, 50 years never, ever creating a relationship with even one black person that gives them access to their experience. That's what we're trying to deal with, well-meaning people who have been underequipped and purposefully myopic about race.\nNC: And all the while Bernadette Thompson laws and changing social norms have really helped to make kind of overt, blatant racism unacceptable in principle anyway. So how come we haven't made progress? Why aren't all the things we put in place working?\nBT: So I think for me it's about changes led by leaders, cultural changes occur across organisations and again it's looking at the diversity of organisations. So what I've said is we've been able to make some progress, indeed much progress on the gender agenda because it comes to our leaders' doors, it's either going to relate to their mother, it's going to relate to their sister, it's going to relate to their daughter, so they get that. But when it comes to issues about race it doesn't come to leaders' doors in the UK. We are not diverse at the higher levels in most of our organisations. In the last couple of weeks I've been using the analogy of the Guinness glass, we're black at the bottom and white on top. We definitely in order to make progress we need to have a latte across our organisations. So for me it's about why we haven't made this progress despite all the reports, despite all the inquiries, despite all the publications that we have out there is that it isn't something that keeps most of our leaders up at night. It doesn't come near their doors. When we have diversity at the top I feel that urgency will be there and it just shows the failings in the systems of actually gripping this and dealing with this. It doesn't come to people's doors.\nNC: Well you mention all those reports which have come out and after current events, certainly in the UK we're going to have, Binna Kandola, yet another report, do you think that's going to make any difference to the pace of change, for example in the workplace?\nBK: It's not the reports it's actually what you do with the actions and the recommendations in the reports. And the problem has been that the various investigations that have been carried out have made lots of recommendations and how many of those have actually been implemented. I mean that's the nub of it. And if people start taking action and we actually know what action we should be taking and another report is not necessarily going to make much difference it's the motivation to do something.\nNC: Well let's just get a bit more of a handle on what we're talking about here I mean the 2020 Parker Review showed 59% of FTSE 350 companies don't meet the target of having at least one director of colour on their boards, eight companies accounted for nearly 25% of the directors of colour but I guess this has a lot to do, Binna, with what happens lower down in organisations?\nBK: It happens much lower down. We know, I mean the research shows actually that, just take graduates it takes longer for a minority graduate to get a job and once they're in a job the pay gap between the minority graduates and their white peers actually widens as soon as 3 1/2 years into employment. So it actually is an indication that career development opportunities are being given to others but not to minorities.\nNC: So John we clearly have this unconscious bias people like to talk about, you've talked about well-meaning people not getting the point but can you talk us through a bit more how it happens and what the impact is on talented people of colour who are overlooked and unpromoted?\nJA: Well I am, I suppose, famously spiky and controversial in that I don't think that unconscious bias is a thing. The unconscious is a thing, I get that, that's a psychological concept; bias is a thing, but what we're talking about here is actual stuff that lives out in the real world. When I'm walking down the street and someone crosses the street when they see me the process in their mind may be invisible to me but the act of crossing the street is not unconscious, that is a part of a process. And in workplaces it's even more so. When you look at the differential in work allocation for minority candidates versus non-minority candidates and when you look and you see a bench of people who is mostly women and minorities versus the people who are actively engaged in projects with senior people, and you see that it's a homogenous white group that looks like the partner, that's not happened accidentally, that has happened because people like the familiar and the similar because they find it easier.\nThe process of the lack of inclusion in workplaces is a function of a choice for personal comfort over organisational performance, make no bones about it. This is not about niceness or being good to black people it's really important. And I think in the workplaces the challenge we face right now that even as we are approaching this problem and none of the people on this panel are part of this problem but when we look at workplaces we still approach minorities and their progress from a deficit model perspective. The idea that you know what women need when they arrive in a business? Women need assertiveness training so that they can speak up in meetings. And then five years later they need de-assertiveness training so they don't frighten the other men in their business. And for black people the same problem. What do they need, what are they missing? Well perhaps we should stop armouring minorities with interventions and instead detoxify the environments that they are existing in. It is amazing to me that we're still talking about inclusion and every initiative is targeted at the people who are the recipients of bias rather than the people who are the deliverers of it, even if that is through micro-aggressions and other sophisticated mechanisms.\nNC: Okay well there is a lot to think about here. Bernadette Thompson what can we do practically, you're of course responsible for many people's working lives, talk me through situations that arise with people because of these background deficits in how we treat people, in what we understand?\nBT: So it's an employee experience and that is what wears people down, linked in absolutely to what John was saying about the deficit model. So as an employee if you are constantly being given some very shabby pieces of work compared to someone who you believe is on an equal footing, the same as that person, those micro-aggressions they're really subtle and sometimes, you know you actually don't realise instantly that you're being kind of side-lined. So if you have continually applied for positions, ten, 20, and I was speaking to someone today and they said, 'Look I have been in this organisation for 35 years, I am tired, I can't do this anymore.' And that is where the system grinds you down.\nAnd it's not that people from a BAME background are less intelligent, far from it, we are super-resilient, but there comes a time where you have tried and you have tried so hard that you either resign to the fact that you know what it's not going to happen for me in this organisation and sadly what you find is a lot of BAME employees just leave to go somewhere else but sadly when they go to that somewhere else the culture's pretty much the same. So it's absolutely a vicious cycle. It is systemic, it is in the workforce and we can't deny it. And what really annoys me is that we are able to grapple some really difficult things. We were able to stand up the Nightingale Hospital just like that. This isn't difficult guys! Why haven't we solved this problem?\nNC: So Binna Kandola let's take a step further and think about the rather complex work situations that people professionals find themselves having to sort out. I'm thinking of a particular situation I came across which was where a black colleague was promoted by top management to a role that they did actually find quite difficult and some of the performance targets weren't being met. Now others in the organisation started getting resentful, thinking that they should have got the job and then outside campaigners took up the cause of the individual, there were accusations of racism starting to be made and then of course it all gets very complicated. And swirling about this and scenarios like it is that awful phrase that you hear that some people use, the race card.\nBK: Yeah there's so much to untangle there, I'll just take the bits and I'll probably forget some bits of what you said but the first part about people in the organisation saying, they've got that job and it's a kind of a tokenistic thing, that if you want to increase bias in organisations, in society, you increase competition. So there's scarce resource, so in this case a promotion, you give it to a minority, look what's happening it's reverse discrimination and they're not getting the job on merit and it's all I have been discriminated against.\nIn addition to that, going back to some of the points that Bernadette was making and John was also alluding to actually, is that one of the things we know about minorities in organisations is that they are more likely to be criticised and less likely to be praised. In fact some research has shown that they are more likely to be criticised and never be praised. Just imagine working in an environment where you're getting no affirmation about the quality of work that you're doing which starts sapping your confidence. So then you move into a role where everybody's looking at you, everybody's criticising you and then your confidence starts to sink and then you get no support. And it's these kind of quiet words that you have, you know don't let it get you down, you'll be fine, you'll pull your way through it, you got this job because you're the best person for the job, there's no way that you can't do this role now. Those quiet words last a few seconds, a few seconds a week can make all the difference between somebody feeling good in the role and not feeling good in the role.\nAnd the point about the race card is that's just such a great way of turning a situation around. So if somebody makes a complaint about racism in the organisation we think that racism no longer exists right, so that's the subtitle of my book The Danger of Indifference. So there's a belief that racism no longer exists. So you then make a complaint about racism, so you've now made a complaint about something that's not there, so you've now made it up and it must be in your head and so you're playing the race card. And that phrase very quickly and very neatly the perpetrator becomes a victim, the victim becomes a perpetrator, like that. You're playing the race card and all of a sudden the sympathy, whatever sympathy there may have been is now with the perpetrator.\nNC: John Amaechi I can see you waving your arms I think you want to come in on this one. I'm particularly interested to know how you unravel complex situations like this in companies and how you actually try and get those who are involved to learn from the experience?\nJA: I don't think it's necessarily that complex. I think people fail to recognise that what we're talking about here is a fundamental misunderstanding of what race is, we forget that it's a social construct, not a biological or genetic construct, we're not a different species as black people. And I think that's where you have to start. I mean I tell people I literally am more likely to be stopped and searched in the summertime than in the wintertime, and that is simply a product of the fact that I go a glorious dark mahogany in the sun and that means that I'm more likely to look like a threat apparently to people because I'm darker.\nSo in our workplaces it's not really that complex, what Binna just described is just the ultimate reversal, the way to make somebody who's making a legitimate claim look like they're a perpetrator, what we have to do in workplaces is be honest about the status quo first.\nOne of the questions I ask companies is are you a meritocracy? And it's really important to have this conversation when you're talking about inclusion because if organisations believe they're a meritocracy then they look exactly as they're supposed to look. There is no point in arguing about that, if they're a meritocracy the very best people are in the spot that they're supposed to be right now. So if you have a board that is all men, if you have a senior leadership group that is all men and all white, that is exactly how it is supposed to look. We need to address that meritocracy idea because if we do that, until we do that everything that is tried in the case of inclusion becomes a case of tipping up the cart, it's unfair, it's positive discrimination. When you realise that we're not in a meritocracy then what's being done is about justice that that is harder to argue with even if you are a sophisticated bigot.\nNC: Sure and it's certainly a time Bernadette for self-reflection, I mean we're all trying to learn from this and one thing I've taken from recent events is to maybe slightly rethink what I understand by the term 'white privilege', I mean this is not really just about having wealth, inherited or otherwise, or having an uncle that puts in a word for you, it's about recognising some of these many reasons, we've heard some of them today, why people of colour hit barriers and don't get the breaks.\nBT: Absolutely. So I think, you know I was watching the Channel 4 programme recently about the kids and racism.\nNC: Oh The School That Tried To End Racism, I saw that, fascinating.\nBT: Absolutely. It was a fascinating programme and just the expression on the children's faces when they were about to take this race and then some certain questions were asked from all the children, and so a certain group of children by virtue of nothing they had done but just their lifestyle and how they had been fortunate to live their life were able to step forward. And you could see the children at the back that, 'I haven't done anything, I'm sure I could whoop with that person in a race but I have no chance because they're already in front!' And that's just explaining it.\nAnd just going back to what John was saying about the deficit model and touching on what Binna was saying, so you come into an organisation, you identify with the organisation, you are proud that you're there but the reality is meritocracy doesn't exist. So then you say, 'Okay let me see what I can do I'll go on a development scheme.' And then you get on the development scheme and then you finish that and, you know you apply for a few jobs, nothing happened, 'Well let me try that talent scheme.' And then you go on a talent scheme. Then you have a conversation with someone after an interview and they say, 'Ooh you were nearly there but you know what maybe if you do this qualification,' so you go and do this qualification. And then you end up, and a lot of our ethnic minorities within the workplace they've gone on every talent scheme under the sun, they've got the qualifications under the sun but what is missing and what we don't talk about a lot is the reality of the network. It is about the network, who knows you, who knows what you can do.\nAnd so there's something for me about our senior leaders who are non-BAME, widening their network and diversifying their networks. So if we ask the top table in so many organisations, how many BAME people do you actually know, do you actually hang out with, mention the top ten? You probably won't get many people able to mention.\nNC: And Bernadette when you say BAME you are of course talking about black, Asian and minority ethnic people. John you want to come in on this.\nJA: I think we should be able to say to mature leaders in organisations do you want to win? Do you want the very best brain, whatever the package that it comes in do you want the best brain or not? Are you willing to deal with some personal discomfort in order to have their brilliance? And I'm just never sure why in an environment like this, where the world can be turned upside down by a tiny string of protein why you wouldn't want the very, very, very best people who could give you the prescience and insight and the smarts to win just at the sacrifice of a little bit of new insight.\nNC: So if that's the case Binna Kandola is it appropriate to ask BAME colleagues to educate you, to tell you where you're going wrong or is that your own job?\nBK: It needs to be part of a conversation. So if you talk to your colleagues about questions you may have but there's lots of ways you can educate yourself and there's lots of ways we could have educated ourselves. I've had, and I'm sure Bernadette and John have had messages from people saying, 'I have a question here can you answer this?' and I have answered them, and I will and I do, I continue to answer them but I do end up saying, 'You know there are resources out there they're called books, you can pick one up and have a read,' so rather than asking me the kind of sometimes quite basic questions, and these are people I've not met for a long time either, and to go back to John's point actually is that I think I might be the only minority person they've met in the last five or six years and they ask these questions I go oh! And part of me doesn't mind but part of me is something you could go to a bit more effort and ask a more sophisticated question based on something that you've read. So it's a balance, so I'm happy to talk but put some effort in.\nNC: Bernadette what's your take on that?\nBT: So I'm, oh my goodness I'm not as tolerant in this particular space, so as Binna was saying there's lots out there. There's lots out there for people to consider and I just feel that look if you want to learn about anything there are books, there are resources. There is something for me about the minority and there's enough stress as a minority why do I have to start explaining to you what it's like to be a minority. So, you know I'm less sympathetic than Binna.\nOver this last few weeks I have been inundated with requests and it sometimes makes you get quite grumpy, you know go and get resource, go and watch a film, there's so much out there, it's not like in the 40s and in the 50s there is stuff, you know you're inundated with stuff out there. There are books, there are blogs. So I just think people if you want to make the effort have a read and then come to me from a place of, 'I read this, can we have a discussion?' I will be a lot more open to that than for you to kind of say, 'Hi Bernadette, what do you think about this?' I'll probably give you a couple of books to read first.\nBK: And just to add to that Nigel I think the other sense of frustration is I kind of feel like saying to people sometimes, 'I did tell you, I did tell you a few years ago and you took no notice. I told you three months ago and you took no notice.' So actually there's kind of a history to this as well, so people aren't just saying, 'I don't want to educate you,' I think what you're hearing is people saying, 'You know what I tried and you weren't bothered, what's different now?'\nNC: And I guess John's going to give everybody short shrift if they ask him that same question?\nJA: I have spent the last three weeks educating people who've just discovered there's racism. So this is part of my job and I do it so other people don't have to do it and that's important. There is actually a more sinister element to this when you think about this in terms of getting the best out of people inside a company. I talked to somebody in a company who'd been there for 18 years and he said, this is the first time a senior person has talked to him about his experience. There is something quite sinister about being able to be inside a company for 18 years and only when they need your insight for reputational protection do they come to you. Black people aren't libraries and they aren't librarians necessarily.\nNC: Okay so let's try and have a few practical suggestions then, how can we start to tool up managers, people managers, so that they can start stopping the behaviours that get in the way of this better performance and this inclusive work environment we all want to see? So who wants to start with that one, Bernadette?\nBT: We have so many strategies within the UK it's unbelievable. What we're talking about isn't new, you know I was having a presentation the other day about some of this stuff and I actually lifted up all the action from 2016 and I was like, look guys if we do the 2016 ones we will really make progress, we know what to do. Within organisations we've got diversity strategies coming out of our ears, we've got race action plans coming out of our ears, what we need to do is pick three things, do those three things, go to the next, do those three and go to the next, and hold our leaders to account.\nI remember a few years ago one of our permanent secretaries Dame Sue Owen said, 'You know what, if we start linking this to performance-related pay of our most senior leaders some people might sit up and actually have a laser focus on some of this.' So I just think we know what to do let's hold our leaders to account. It might well be it's tied to a couple of their bonus quota but we know what to do, this stuff isn't new, dust the strategy that you did in 2000 and start taking action and start holding leaders to account. That's my view.\nNC: Binna we've just heard clearly from Bernadette that we should just do them but some people think that we have the diversity rules and initiatives and we are doing them.\nBK: Well some of the things that we're being asked to do aren't very good either. I think when you introduced the session you talked about box ticking Nigel, and some of the boxes we're being asked to tick are actually just totally irrelevant and some of them are very misguided, so I've seen it several times now in a number of organisation's policies that we're going to try and have diverse panels for interviews because it's an easy thing to do and we get a diverse interview panel together and what the research shows is if you've got a diverse, untrained panel and a trained panel of white men the group that will make the fairest and best decisions are the trained panel and yet we're jumping to this superficial kind of argument that if we get a diverse panel together it will be a silver bullet for it. It isn't it's training but training takes longer and it's kind of typical of the thinking we want something very quick without actually thinking. So some of the boxes we're being asked to tick make no difference because they never would. And I think in terms of a CIPD podcast I think the HR profession itself needs to do a lot of self-reflection.\nWe did a survey two years ago, 1,500 people, 60% are black people, 42% of Asian people, said they'd experienced racism in the workplace, 20% of those experienced physical and verbal abuse. So like John was saying some of this was just horrible. The least effective action they could take was report it to HR. Less than about 20% of people said it was an effective action. 20% of people who took that action said it was effective. So actually it was the worst action anybody could take. So actually there is a degree of self-reflection about the HR profession itself and the way it responds to these issues.\nNC: So John how could HR improve its performance here?\nJA: It has to stop thinking that interventions are the solution. Individual behaviour and a codified expectation, a clear and codified expectation of behaviour of colleagues and leaders is the answer most of the time. So people who are even allies now they want to jump into an intervention, ooh can I get involved in reverse mentoring, it's like these things exist because you aren't doing the stuff that you do with white people with black people, that's why that exists. So how about just sponsor everybody who's driven and ambitious?\nIt's about individual behaviour, every single person needs to reflect on their winces, right, all the times they've made those mistakes with people who are different reflect on that and instead of, as those really accomplished people do, brushing it aside as an anomaly, hold it at our core and say, 'I'm going to use this wince as a reason to never make this mistake again.' And the second thing they can do is in every single circumstance where you've, ooh, your antenna goes up because you know someone's done something that's just a little bit but you're afraid someone's going to call you politically correct, forget that. That's the moment that you use your privilege and your power and your position whether it's in HR or any other thing to say, 'Actually no, that's not who we are, that's not how we behave,' you address the minutia and that way you don't end up with 'me too', you don't end up with huge racist class action lawsuits, but nobody wants to address the minutia because you don't get likes for it, you don't get hugs for it, it's just invisible hard work.\nBK: But something you said earlier John I think needs to complement what you've just said and I agree with what you said but something you said right at the beginning of the discussion was actually there needs to be an acceptance that racism exists in society and it exists here in this organisation. So I think we shouldn't forget the point that you started this discussion off with that there's that acceptance that it's real and it's here and it may not be in the grossest forms, a bit like Bernadette was saying that those micro-behaviours that you see in the workplace they have, I think Bernadette was saying about you're not clear those behaviours it's the sheer ambiguity of whether it happened or not which creates the stress.\nJA: Yeah.\nNC: So Bernadette give us something to hold onto as we try and do better.\nBT: I was just going to come to the point of the HR profession. So I am proud to be an HR professional however we need to look at ourselves first as a profession, what is the ethnic diversity of the average HR profession? Let's start from there, what are we doing about that? So I think there's something for the HR profession, we are usually the gatekeepers of all this stuff. We are the people that go out to talk to the rest of the business but you know when I was little they'll say well before you point all the rest of the other fingers point back at you, what are we doing as a profession to actually look at the people who are helping the organisations? Who are our leaders within the HR profession across the UK? What is the diversity like? What can we do within the HR profession? How can CIPD hold some of the organisations to account or in some way hold the mirror up to the profession to say, 'Look guys if we're going to fix this charity begins at home.'\nNC: Fantastic point to end on. Worth pointing out there's just a bit of further reading before we go, race inclusion is a core area where the CIPD can help as we've heard, it's got a raft of resources, recommendations for employers and government, look online for the CIPD anti-racism hub Tackling Racism In The Workplace. And I can do no better than quote a few headlines: build the business case for increasing diversity; identify levels of diversity with HR data and use them to explore barriers; review recruitment practices and career cliff edges and build an inclusive culture. There are a lot more to which I might add learn to recognise your own privilege and listen to the experiences of black and ethnic minority people, they really do matter.\nOn all our behalf let me just thank John Amaechi, Bernadette Thompson and Binna Kandola for a superb discussion, for lending their wisdom to this debate. Next time we cover the topic it would be nice to think we'll be reporting on some real progress.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:27:59\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy:  Let's face it there's a lot to fight about, or for, just now as we all cope with uncertainty and hard financial decisions. So here's how this month we're all about the essential skill of defusing and challenging conflict.\nHello I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast. Conflict is inevitable when humans with different perspectives and opinions interact but now at a time when it's more important than ever to come together and strengthen relationships the new world we find ourselves in could stoke destructive clashes and bullying behaviour; rows maybe just sparked by a wrong word or a mishandled conversation. So how can people professionals flush trouble out, even harness benefits from constructive conflict?\nThis podcast was recorded just before lockdown restrictions were imposed in the UK and while no one could have predicted the scale and impact of the pandemic surely the lessons here are critical.\nWell okay everyone stop plotting at the water cooler in the corner because we've got a trio here with a lot of experience in spotting, understanding and resolving strife in the workplace and in fact we'll hear that even fostering showdowns has its place. As someone once said conflict in an organisation is the sound of cracks in the system - a warning that something needs to be fixed. Most of us know, or have known, an otherwise savvy but otherwise weak manager or boss will do anything to avoid tackling the root cause of conflict, a strategy which usually makes things far worse as time goes by. So let's get some top tips. Amy Gallo is a Contributing Editor at Harvard Business Review, author of the HBR Guide to Dealing with Conflict, she delivers evidence-based ideas on how to improve working relationships. I can't wait to see how she handles any hostile questions! Hello.\nAmy Gallo: Nice to be here.\nNC: Clive Lewis, OBE is Chief Executive of Globis Mediation Group, a business psychologist and author and flying commercial mediator, six years a non-executive director in the NHS and now on the University of the West of England Board. Hello.\nClive Lewis: Hello\nNC: But first to set the scene Rachel Suff, Senior Employee Relations Adviser for the CIPD. She's a Masters in Human Resource Management and has led a string of policy and research studies and health and wellbeing at work. Hello.\nRachel Suff: Hello.\nNC: Now anything I suppose Rachel can start a simmering office war, power struggles, ego, somebody else's laziness, pay gaps, deadlines, what does the research tell us are the most common causes of conflict?\nRS: Well yes we did publish recent research at the CIPD on managing conflict at work and what really came through strongly was the biggest cause is a kind of catchall term really which was differences in personalities and working styles. So obviously that can cover a multitude of different human interactions. So I think we do need to dig a bit deeper to see what really are those underlying causes of conflict. The kind of behaviours that cause conflict, by far the greatest kind of behaviour was lack of respect. So perception I think plays a part as well in terms of what we regard as conflict, whether it's positive, negative.\nNC: Now Clive Lewis you see all this at first hand and often get flown in to try and sort it out, talk if you would a little bit about what the sort of things we've heard about mean for an organisation?\nCL: So let's pick upon a couple of the aspects that Rachel has mentioned. I would certainly agree that the issue of personality fallouts, and I would refer to it as working with your psychological opposite, so an obvious example would be someone who's an introvert working with someone who's extroverted, there are differences and those differences can mean that either the work relationship is complementary but often it means that it's the trigger for conflict. So for example the person who's more extroverted might want the introverted person to get to the point quicker, might want an idea to be moved straight into action rather than waiting and reflecting and when you multiply that over a number of times with thousands of people in an organisation it can create tension.\nNC: So this is about what, productivity being lost, creativity?\nCL: Yes so specifically what you see is areas around productivity. You see the amount of capacity available in an organisation for work to be conducted that is lowered. You see issues such as sickness and absence increasing. You might also see an impact on things such as customer relationships because people often express to others how they are feeling themselves. So that could be problematic for an organisation if they have someone not dealing with a customer correctly.\nNC: Amy Gallo don't these things often build up because, as I hinted at the beginning, managers let things fester, they allow these conflicts to gain traction?\nAG: Yeah, unfortunately managers aren't often given training on how to handle these, what often are small issues around style differences or differences in approach and so they don't know how to address them and in fact they often avoid them. I think Clive and I are probably brought into organisations for very different reasons. It sounds like Clive's brought in when there's conflict that hasn't been resolved, I'm often brought in because there's not enough conflict, people are being overly polite or their organisation has, what some people call, artificial harmony, everyone says they get along but actually they don't under the surface or they're not surfacing new ideas or innovations. So managers really need to be equipped with the skills and the frameworks to both manage difficult conflict, unhealthy conflict, but also to bring out differences of opinion so people are able to surface new ideas, to collaborate, so that you can create an inclusive work environment.\nNC: Okay well you're hinting at a different kind of conflict there, so we'll get into that in just a minute but before we do Rachel Suff just say a little bit more about why people managers do allow all this stuff to go on. Is it perhaps because they don't feel in their own minds that their own management will back them in actually resolving the deeper seated problems that are making people fight?\nRS: That's a really good question, I'm glad Amy brought up the question of managers because what our research found is that line managers are really at the centre stage of conflict, often being a cause of it themselves. When we asked employees in a survey who did you have the most difficult relationship, who was the conflict with and the bullying and harassment, if that happened? They said their manager. And when they reported a conflict to their manager they said their manager was just as likely to make it worse as better, the situation. So I think this raises a whole number of questions. Like you say Amy managers often aren't trained, why aren't they trained? I think organisations often don't appreciate that conflict happens. They don't have strategies to deal with it, strategically. But also they're not training line managers in people management generally, let alone specifically to manage conflict. So where they do train managers they're much better at handling conflict. We've got the evidence around that. And managers shy away quite often from personal issues. They find it a really difficult part of their job.\nCL: Yes I would agree with that. As Rachel's speaking I'm just thinking of an experience that I've recently been helping an organisation with where a line manager was having an appraisal conversation with a person who he'd only recently taken over managing, just a year or so in.\nNC: I've got a feeling of dread already.\nCL: And for the previous ten years this person was managed by someone else and had achieved an appraisal rating of 4, which is good on a 5 point scale, but the new manager gave an appraisal rating of 2, without much of a context about why that was. But the difficulty was how he handled the conversation when his colleague said that he was going to raise a complaint because he couldn't understand how, in the short space of time, his performance had dropped so badly and so significantly. But the line manager's response was telling his direct report that his life wouldn't be worth living if he decided to raise a complaint.\nAG: Wow!\nNC: So Amy what would you do in that situation?\nAG: Oh boy! I mean you have to have sympathy on both sides there because that employee for years thought they were doing incredibly well and to all of a sudden have a 2 when you've had 4 for that many years is shocking and of course you want to raise a complaint. And you have sympathy for the manager whose job it is to give direct and honest feedback and that employer was not getting it. It sounds like neither of them quite handled the situation well without actually appreciating the other person's perspective. And I think that's one of the key things that when dealing with conflict is really trying to understand where is the other person coming from. We so quickly assume the person is being unreasonable or is out to get us or even has a completely different working style than we do, rather than focusing on what we have in common, whether that's a shared goal or even a common style.\nNC: And that case study you talked about Clive what actually happened in the end between the manager and the worker?\nCL: Yes well disappointingly the direct report left the organisation, in fact I was asked to facilitate that exit transition for him on the basis that he had lost trust in his line manager. But even more interestingly I was back in touch with the organisation about a year later and I asked the HR professional that I was working with what had happened to the line manager and about six months after that incident the line manager also left, having had just under 30 years of service, was highly regarded, highly respected, but the story of what had allegedly happened left such a bad taste in the mouth of the senior managers of organisation he left two years before he was due to retire.\nAG: That's such an interesting story because one of the things I think about with conflict is there's often this emotional shrapnel that gets left in the wake of a conflict. So even if the conflict is just between you and me Clive it's very likely that Nigel and Rachel will suffer as a result of it. And there's no doubt that there are many, many people effected by what was an uncomfortable situation for two people. All the more reason we need to handle these conflicts in very thoughtful and careful ways.\nNC: So Rachel good practice how do you start to lift a situation like that?\nRS: Well I think performance management is such a flashpoint often for conflict. Some of it is around perception as well, somebody's feedback may not come across as positive but I think again managers just aren't trained enough to go about their role in giving feedback in situations like that in a positive way. There's a problem with performance management as a process and then there is the issue of how it can cause conflict and how to give feedback and have a relationship that's ongoing where you can have conversations, not just a one-off meeting where you give a rating because I think that's how it is seen quite often, how it's developed in organisations, rather than having that relationship where you can just have ongoing dialogue about performance.\nCL: Yes I agree and one of the issues that comes up time and time again in situations I'm asked to help with is the sort of trust. And I often spend time breaking that down because trust essentially is about character and competence and to refer back to the example I gave a few moments ago the direct report decided that he could not continue to work for his line manager who would not accept that he had uttered those words, and unfortunately decided to leave the organisation because of a lack of trust in his line manager. But on the topic of having a difficult conversation I just want to say something on this because I agree that it's a big issue for line managers, however what I often find is that there are three things to think about in terms of having the conversation and in one of my books on having a difficult conversation I talk about the concept of being a tackler or a dodger. So a tackler is someone who would grapple with this situation, get involved and have the discussion. Of course a dodger would put it off and not have it. But there's a third aspect which is a reckless tackler. And this is someone who will jump in with both feet first, not think it through, do they have the evidence, do they have the facts, and in doing so they can do far more harm than good.\nAG: Yeah in my book I talk about similar, seeker versus avoider, which is similar to tackler and dodger and I recently was doing an event where someone asked a question where does emotion play into seeker versus avoider? And I think you can be an avoider and be an emotional avoider or you can be a seeker and be an emotional seeker, which is similar to this reckless tackler.\nCL: Yes.\nAG: And the damage done when you're not making conscientious, thoughtful decisions about how to respond in these situations is grave, people leave jobs, people issue threats to each other. I've seen it blow up in people's faces quite often.\nNC: So it seems to me Rachel that solving some of these problems involves quite a bit of analysis before you jump in and that has to be done perhaps by somebody who is not one of the parties, and the trouble is organisations don't often have room for that. The senior management will say, 'Look you sort this out.'\nRS: Yeah I think it depends on the nature of the conflict, how low level it is. You would hope where there is an issue of conflict, whatever the reason, in a team where the line manager is able to spot that and tackle it head on, if we're going to use that kind of language, which I think is helpful because it means doing it in a sensitive way. So I think the line manager needs skills to do that because I think the key lesson if you're a manager, from the conversation so far, is the conflict isn't going to go away, or very rarely does it go away, it's only likely to fester. So I think for a manager to act as a, I won't say, mediator because that suggests a whole other level of skillset but as a facilitator and have a conversation each. Try and get to the underlying cause of the conflict because sometimes the issue over which something erupts or festers isn't necessarily the real issue that's going on underneath the surface. So really a manager needs to have an awareness and be alert to any kind of underlying tensions in their team. They need to know their team so they're able to have that one to one conversation with each and hopefully bring the two together because most people at that point do want a resolution, they don't want to leave the organisation. So nipping things in the bud before they escalate if that doesn't work then we are fully supportive of all the kind of benefits that having an independent third party can bring to a situation.\nAG: Managers also need to be careful that they don't step in to solve conflicts that can be solved between two people because I think one of the risks conflicts always get escalated to the next person higher up on the ladder, people don't learn to solve their own problems. So I think you say this in the report you want conflict to be solved at the lowest level possible without having to escalate it if you don't have to. Of course the line manager does have to step in occasionally.\nNC: So Clive how do you actually get people to go back to a tricky dispute and solve it for themselves?\nCL: Equipping them with the skills to do so because it isn't just line managers that should be equipped with the skills of having difficult conversations, it's something that should be in place from the ground up and most people run scared. Going back to Amy's point about emotions, they take over and as a result they take flight. But at the very basic level equipping colleagues with the skills that they need to be able to sit down and have a conversation, in one aspect it's talked about, in fact in the US, Amy, it's talked about as a coffee conversation, sitting down with each other in an informal setting and being able to eyeball each other and talk about some of those difficulties might mean that the tension deescalates quicker than being in a much more formal environment.\nNC: Now Amy you've hinted at this already when I got the notes for this podcast I was surprised by the phrase 'negative conflict' you know like there could possibly be positive conflict. And then I came across this phrase 'smart fights', the idea that having an issue out might actually be a force for good.\nAG: Yeah I mean there are lots of positive benefits to conflict if it's harnessed in the right way and if it's handled productively and professionally. The example that Clive gave earlier certainly is not an example of that but there are tensions that as a manager you want to bring out in a team. Let's say you have a team member who cares immensely about speed, about getting things done really quickly, that person might sacrifice quality in the effort to get things done quickly, so you might want to partner them with someone who cares a lot about quality. That of course is going to create natural tension, you want those people to disagree, you want them to hash it out so you get a better work product as a result. We also know if conflict's handled well that it creates stronger relationships between employees. If they're able to disagree and then get to the other side it sets a precedent that it's okay to have a difference of opinion here and we can come through it okay. It's also the foundation for an inclusive work environment. If you spend tons of time, energy, money, trying to bring in people from different backgrounds and different perspectives and then you tell them, 'By the way we don't disagree here,' you've lost any of the value from having a diverse workforce. So you really have to make sure that people feel comfortable expressing their opinions, having disagreements, having even fights that they can get past and move on, as long as they're healthy.\nNC: Rachel I can see some dangers in this idea of setting up a smart fight between people, somebody's going to lose and we can all think of time wasted trying to persuade somebody that they're not going about the job the best way, so there must be dangers in this approach surely?\nRS: Well I think we're taught to have a perception in our culture that conflict is, by its nature, negative, so I think it's really interesting to hear Amy talk about it in a different way because I think we all run a bit scared of conflict. And I think organisations as well their cultures tend to be set up in that way and not necessarily making the most of their diverse workforce. You know we're all human, we all come with such a different mix of backgrounds, perspectives, ideas, so it is setting the kind of working environment. And senior leaders and so on have got a responsibility here as well because you have to feel safe to disagree in an organisation and not be afraid and sometimes agree to disagree but you need the environment where you feel you can do that. So leaders and managers they do tend to set the tone where people feel that they can discuss things openly, safely.\nNC: I've always found it's quite useful to be a bit Californian with people, if you can tell they don't like something you can say, 'Oh you don't seem to like that idea?' or 'I sense some anger here.' Sometimes we think things about what people do or say but we don't act on them.\nCL: Yeah possibly and I think that Rachel mentioned senior people and the thought that comes to my mind as she mentioned that is that the smart fights which I'd often referred to as constructive controversy...\nAG: I like that.\nCL: ...as a term the academics often use is this ability to have something out but it might lead towards productive conversations. But my point is that it's not just at the lower levels in an organisation, often this becomes an issue for boards. You often find that those who are at a board level in an organisation are not backward in coming forward and you might have that as an environment.\nNC: They think they're paid to be a contrarian.\nCL: But not shying away from having those boardroom conversations that are often necessary to think about maybe do we need to diversify, do we need to go in a different direction etc.\nNC: So if we're agreed that a bit of that tension is good for an organisation how do you reengineer your workplace to get issues in the open?\nRS: Well I think it does come down to that big question about how do you create the right kind of culture? And we talked about senior leaders already and I think they do have a defining influence on what kind of behaviour's followed, what's acceptable, what isn't. They are going to set the tone and managers will follow them as well and employees are going to follow their lead really. So culture is every little interaction and we can all make a difference. So we can all try and be ourselves, put across our point of view, be very respectful and be professional still even if you do disagree. Put yourself in other people's shoes. But I really do think the onus is on the organisation and leaders in particular to really think about what culture, how they're going to handle conflict and how they're going to embed that across the organisation.\nAG: And I think Rachel what the culture needs is an element of psychological safety, you mentioned safety earlier and this term psychological safety Amy Edmundson from Harvard Business School coined this phrase to describe the feeling that you can say what you believe without fear of retribution, even if that's contrary to what other people believe. That is not an easy culture to create in your organisation always but it does start with senior leaders, as you said Rachel, and I think really what you want to convey is we're not infallible, we're in a process of constantly learning, of course we have to execute, of course we have to reach our targets and goals but we will learn in the process and part of learning is making mistakes. And not being driven by ego is probably one of the most important things a senior leader can do, because if you show we are able to put our egos down here people are going to be much more willing to speak up even if they're not 100% sure about what they're saying.\nNC: I can imagine Clive when you're being flown into an organisation to sort something out people will say, 'Well it's all right for you to be called in to sort out conflicts but this is really about I can't meet my deadlines, my targets are unrealistic, there's all this stress, they don't pay me enough.' And those are things that can't be resolved by us all sitting round and having a constructive argument?\nCL: Well I would disagree with you because often the reason why...\nNC: I'll see you outside!.\nCL: ...I and my colleagues may get a call is because the organisation hasn't been able to create the environment for the conversation to take place. So often what I might provide, or someone who's in the same industry as myself would provide, is this concept of safety, being able to have a conversation without fear of retribution, to go back to a term that Amy has used. And often what might come out of those are some of the practical elements that you mentioned and being able to try and figure out a way to try and work through them, even if they can't be solved straightaway, someone might not be able to get the 5% or 10% increase that they wanted on their salary. However there might be something about additional training opportunities etc. that can be part of the conversation.\nAG: Nigel you mentioned risks earlier what are the risks to smart fights? And I think this is one of them which is that if you don't have this element of safety people will fear retribution or they'll fear getting in trouble for raising a dissenting opinion and sometimes they will be rightly afraid because I have seen in organisations, I'm sure Clive and Rachel have too, that people who are saying things that are unpopular tend to be seen as outcasts, their careers tend to stall. So this is certainly one of the risks if you encourage people to fight in an organisation where dissented opinions aren't respected you're putting people at risk of ruining their careers.\nNC: And I suppose too Rachel it's about knowing your people. If you have a large organisation and people get upset about stuff which causes conflict you may not even know what it is they're upset about.\nRS: That's true and I think as well as part of creating that environment it means as an organisation sending a really clear message to create that safe work environment that where behaviour and conflict is negative, where it really has crossed that line and it's inappropriate and it's causing distress and it's harmful, that you will take that seriously. So it's really understanding where that line lies and making sure that the message is out there that you will deal quickly, robustly, and listen to people's concerns effectively.\nNC: So that's your top tip really?\nRS: I think it is yes.\nNC: And perhaps one to finish from Clive and Amy.\nCL: Well one of the themes that I'm hearing about more and more in organisations is almost turning this on its head in terms of thinking about conflicts as being something to avoid and what are some of the principles around behaviour that we should be working towards, and one of the biggest things for me that I'm seeing at the moment is this concept of civility in the workplace, how we treat others, doing unto others as you would like to be done by or done to yourself, if you like and just being respectful. And if you're able to move towards a culture that is much more about respect for others and politeness a lot of these issues that we are seeing and experiencing about conflict are likely to fall away over time.\nNC: Amy Gallo.\nAG: I think my top tip for people, whether you're a senior leader or whether you're an individual who's involved in a conflict is to think about what is your goal, what is it you actually want to achieve? I think sometimes we get our egos involved, we get so focused on being right or feeling like we've been wronged, that we need to reverse that, that we forget what our ultimate goal is.\nNC: So getting through the day isn't an adequate answer?\nAG: Well maybe it is but what is it you actually want to achieve, either in your career in the organisation and what shared goal do you have with your colleagues that you can focus on to get through some of these more difficult conflicts?\nNC: Well so what have we learnt? Well conflict's part and parcel of making progress and achieving the goals of your organisation. It shouldn't be feared, we've certainly learnt that. Our trio say embrace it as an opportunity and of course you can draw on the latest resources from the CIPD and from Amy and Clive's books and elsewhere to work all this through. What's that old joke, don't let the sun go down on a quarrel stay up and fight. So don't ignore conflict embrace it, it's your job to do so.\nLet me just thank Clive Lewis, Amy Gallo and Rachel Suff, from us, from me Nigel Cassidy and all of us here at the CIPD it's goodbye.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:30:01\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Is your work team okay or struggling? Do you have what it takes to look after people's health and wellbeing so they're able to get the job done? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWell back in the day in PC world, that's pre-coronavirus, people used to say if you're not in the room you're not in the know. Well now nobody's in the room they're on Zoom and it's left people managers with a new skills gap. They freely admitted to the CIPD that they lack the confidence and know-how to spot signs of physical and mental ill health in their now far-flung teams.\nWell as we speak we're still in lockdown; most of us are stressed to some degree; there's fear of infection, of isolation, there's fear of redundancy and major financial worries. And all too soon those personal and family worries can tip over into mental health issues. Let's face it, it could be your organisation's insensitive or disorganised management which is to blame.\nSo here with top tips on how to monitor and aid your team's wellbeing, all joining me online from who knows where, we've Andrea Winfield, UK HR Director at Microsoft, hello.\nAndrea Winfield: Hiya\nNC: Next we have a consultant occupational and forensic psychiatrist, Professor Neil Greenberg, Professor of Defence Mental Health at Kings College who served in the United Kingdom Armed Forces for more than 23 years and also runs the March on Stress Consultancy. Hello.\nNeil Greenberg: Hello.\nNC: And from the home team Rachel Suff, the CIPD's Senior Employee Relations Adviser. Rachel's a qualified HR practitioner with a masters who's led a range of policy and research studies about health and wellbeing at work. Hello Rachel.\nRachel Suff: Hello.\nNC: Now in one sense I suppose, let's start with you Rachel, this is nothing new, I mean before the pandemic mental ill health was the number one cause of long-term sickness and absence among UK workers so start us off if you will with a sense of the new difficulties that managers are now facing in looking after their people particularly in the face of lockdown.\nRS: Well yes exactly we knew mental ill health was a serious issue in workplaces and this pandemic has brought the risk of further psychological unwellness to the fore as well as the physical risk. I think for a start the situation is very uncertain. There's a lot of fear and anxiety and that's very uncomfortable I think for a lot of people, and also I think a lot of people are in very challenging personal situations, perhaps if they're caring for somebody who's vulnerable, as well as fears of their own around the pandemic, but also if they're juggling childcare at a time when they're working. Some people have been furloughed, some people have lost their income or a partner has, so there's worries about financial wellbeing, even bereavement in some situations. So all those pressures that people would feel before the pandemic have been exacerbated now. I don't think there's anybody that isn't having some kind of challenging experience.\nNC: Andrea in the face of all this, I mean I guess we can take it as a given that Microsoft has the technology to facilitate its workers at home, but what have been your people priorities since the lockdown?\nAW: Well I think these circumstances have completely changed people priorities. I guess there are some things that just become more important than ever and will stay the same, so taking a values-led approach to how we take care of our employees is just super important and people management and leadership has just never been more critical.\nAt Microsoft we've taken a family-oriented approach to this, so we know that the number one priority for all of our employees is to put themselves and their family and their health first and so everything that we've doing is trying to put that at the centre and at the start of the list of the things that we're concentrating on and working towards.\nAs you say, we've always mobilised our employees to be able to work virtually and in a mobile cloud-first world but working from home permanently under the circumstances that we find ourselves in where people aren't just working from home, I think it's quite difficult these days to decide whether or not you're working from home or sleeping from the office and so preparing people for successful homeworking is a real priority for us.\nNC: But you do a lot of practical stuff don't you with access to counsellors, GPs, sending round chairs and workstations, that's obviously because you're a large organisation but all this kind of stuff's a lot harder if you don't have the resources that you have.\nAW: Well you're right we do have deep pockets and that has enabled us to be able to courier people's monitors and chairs to their home addresses. But part of this is also just being able to give very practical advice to people. It doesn't cost anything to be able to give people tips on how to maintain their wellbeing or tips for how to take care of your mental health, to guide and coach managers on checking in on their teams, to hold and honour commitment to keep staying in touch. All of these things are free, don't cost money, but it's about where you focus leadership attention I think.\nNC: Okay so Neil Greenberg there's clearly a kind of gold standard of best practice here, we've heard some of the ideas already, but there is a messy reality for people about the day-to-day isn't there? It has a lot to do with employers who may be a bit negative or just plain disorganised just dumping work on people, I just wonder what sort of things you've observed since we all started hunkering down, and those of us who can, still working from home?\nNG: I think from my point of view as an evidence-based scientist but also a psychiatrist what I've noticed is that a lot of organisations seem to place a heavy reliance on psychological counsellors or therapists as being available in the background to support staff and clearly for an important minority that's really important. But I think just as Andrea said actually all the evidence that we have from our studies of organisations shows that the most important thing that organisations can do is to make sure that junior supervisors, so the junior managers, really are able to both understand what the impact of the current situation is on their staff, take account of that and then most importantly they need to have the confidence to have what we call a psychologically savvy, supportive conversation.\nSo we know that actually good managers tend to be good managers from a mental health viewpoint because they're able to get someone to open up just a little bit about what is really going on with them and in most ordinary workplace conversations a manager might say, 'How are you doing?' and the person says, 'Oh I'm fine,' and then the assumption is that they're okay, when of course fine can mean absolutely anything and it isn't really a mental health check.\nSo we've been placing a lot of emphasis, particularly in the healthcare sector, but also other organisations we're supporting, in trying to make sure that those junior managers who don't really feel confident in talking about mental health, actually can have those supportive conversations, because once you do that all the evidence is that it has a dramatically positive, protective effect on staff's mental health.\nNC: So Rachel Suff it's quite difficult isn't it to see these small cues and hints perhaps that something isn't right and quite hard to identify just in a work video meeting?\nRS: Yes it can be and I think what Neil said is so important because we know at the CIPD from our research that line managers are dealing with a lot of expectation on them, and this was before the pandemic, to look after people's health and wellbeing and they will be the first port of call very often if people are worried, but also people might not feel able to talk about their health if they're not feeling very good and seek that help. And without that face-to-face interaction where you can pick up on facial expressions, body language and so on it can be even more difficult. So really important that the people profession support line managers.\nAnd yes it's about having that one-to-one conversation. But I think if line managers feel able to open up themselves about how they feel, show a little bit of vulnerability, then I think that can help as well. So I think this kind of interaction in terms of video conferencing is important, but also a phone call. I think because we are seeing a lot of video interaction some people can feel a bit overwhelmed by that as well. So I think it's just being about to have that really empathetic conversation, build up the trust with your team and have regular catch ups where you ask open questions to feel your way into that conversation in terms of how they're feeling.\nAW: Yeah absolutely I couldn't agree more. And we've been doing a lot with managers to really help them with those dialogues by starting every one-to-one or every team meeting with the question, what am I feeling? Asking people to name those feelings in one or two words, asking people the question, what's distracting you right now? And I think it's really important for us to help our line managers set an expectation that it's perfectly normal and really expected that most things are going to be harder in times of crisis and uncertainty again a false belief that we can do the work that we were doing previously. So part of it is about setting the scene, having those check ins, having those check outs, asking people what's on their mind and digging deeper than they're fine.\nThe other part, obviously quite practically, is actually about the workload that you're asking people to expect to take on. There's a lot that everybody is carrying and we're working in circumstances that make normality, this kind of concept of new normal is a bit ironic really because there's nothing normal about what's going on right now. So managers actually working with people on priorities to talk a bit more about what must continue, what's important to continue but could be done at a slower pace, and what work is just not relevant or just can't be done in the current circumstances. So for those employers that are able to keep people at work I think that focus on workload and priorities is also critical in helping people balance home and work.\nNC: I think what you're saying there about prioritising is excellent but I just want to pick up with Neil Greenberg this question of managers being empathetic, I mean most of us are not, well we're not trained social workers, it can be quite intrusive can't it having a clumsy manager making small talk on office video, I mean we all in the normal course of work we have different aspects to our lives don't we, we have multiple rolls and some of us don't even want to share our taste in curtains when we're on the screen let alone laying bare our personal situations.\nNG: You're absolutely right, there isn't a one size fits all model for how people get support and indeed there's people out there who just don't really access support and they seem to go about their lives quite happily doing so and if you start to try and force those people to have deep and meaningful conversations you're not going to get a good response. But the overwhelming evidence generally from various sources is that social support and social networks are actually very psychologically sustaining. And it's a very cheesy phrase but I really do believe it in organisations that often resilience doesn't lie in individuals it lies between them.\nAnd so there's been a sort of explosion over the last 20 years of interventions and things like yoga or mindfulness or lots of other interesting wellbeing interventions and actually when you look at the overall impact of them they're actually pretty small because what really matters is feeling that your organisation has your back and that you've got someone that you can share your concerns, niggles, or just irritation or complains to and that they'll listen.\nSo as well as making sure that managers can have these psychologically savvy chats another really important protective mechanism within organisations is to have what is often known as a peer support programme. And that basically takes account of the fact that even with the best manager in the work sometimes we're not going to open up to them, they write my report, they're going to give me jobs and I don't want them to think bad of me even though they're a very decent person. But actually most of us will speak to colleagues. And so if you can implement a good evidence-based peer support programme, of which there are a number around, then actually again you begin to build on those social bonds that keep us psychologically well and that's really useful, not just in terms of mental health but also in terms of productivity.\nNC: Well that's a great idea. Rachel just talk a bit more about how organisations can support those line managers who are having to do some of this kind of stuff and they've perhaps never done it before.\nRS: Well yes because now they're going to be doing it in a very challenging situation. So all those organisations like Microsoft that have invested already in their training and support and advice and guidance for line managers in terms of how they manage people and support their health and wellbeing will really be reaping the benefits but obviously there's an opportunity now, we might be in a crisis situation but it's still possible for HR teams and employers to extend that support.\nAnd I think as well as providing guidance and support up front I think it's really important as well that HR is there to provide more focused and tailored support to help line managers deal with some of the complex personal situations that some people will be in, because we know that some people will be experiencing mental ill health, possibly for the first time, and feel very, very challenged in this situation. Obviously if somebody is known to have a mental health condition before the pandemic then special care needs to be taken there.\nBut I think it's really HR being available to line managers on an ongoing basis to provide that sounding board, and occupational health as well of course. So please do make use of your occupational health teams where you have the benefit of that expertise. So make the most of that as well as your employee assistance programme. But it really is not just a one-off intervention it's just being there and being supportive of your line managers day in, day out really.\nNC: So Andrea Winfield from Microsoft we've heard talk there about occupational health we do still in our minds think about that as something you do with people when they're in the office so this is quite a different mindset isn't it and managers aren't equipped to deal with a lot of this?\nAW: Well you know managers aren't trained health professionals and nor should we expect them to be and I think employers having access to these specialist services, whether or not it's occupational health facilities or through your healthcare premiums and insurances, access to specific referral pathways that get people access to counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy, these are all great resources but they do need to be done by specialists and I think it's quite important to make that distinction. There's a lot on your average manager's shoulders day-to-day and managing the health and wellbeing of your team is clearly one of them but in these times I do worry about the pressure that we put on managers to try and be everything to everybody.\nThe same with the HR team actually and so having some of these specialist supports and having those support services working virtually so that irrespective of whether or not you're in a physical office working in customer sight or wherever you might be in the world being able to access some of the support services that complement what's already available in society is critically important.\nNG: So in terms of again going back to the evidence really important study I think that came out of New South Wales in Australia, so they looked at first station managers and these are people who look after firefighters who are obviously going out and doing challenging stuff all the time and what they did is they put in place a four hour training package that enabled the fire station managers to be able to have one of these psychologically savvy conversations and it didn't just give them information it also gave them the skills and got them to practice it during the session.\nThey did what's called a randomised control trial, which is a really high quality trial and the outcome that they were looking for is how much did it decrease sickness absence in the six months after the intervention. And what they found overall, and it was published in a UK journal, was that for every pound invested in that manager training programme it saved PS10 in sickness absence over the following six months. And that's because we know that, and I quite agree with Andrea we shouldn't be asking managers to be mental health professionals that's wrong and it would stress them out if they had to do so, but actually the simple interventions and the act of listening and understanding what your staff members are going through can have an immense benefit for an organisation and not only will it help people stay fit at work it also increases the chance that they will go and seek professional help if they need it.\nAW: I agree entirely with you Neil on that point. One of the things that we've been doing and investing in over the last 12 months is encouraging managers and setting out expectations for them to just model, coach and care. Three very simple expectations that we have as managers at Microsoft and in the context of what's going on right now modelling might look around and asking managers to take care of themselves first. It's a bit like putting the oxygen mask on yourself so that you're able to support others, and what healthy routines have you got in place to help role model your own mental and physical wellbeing and the coaching is the conversation that you have and remembering that we're all human at the end of the day and it's one human talking to another human and enquiring what's really on people's minds and carers just making sure that we're checking in with one another and giving people that time and creating space for community to happen, whether or not that's peer to peer mentoring or whether or not through employee resource groups, or just making a call. These are the things that we're asking managers to do right now.\nNC: And Neil this situation we're in at the moment are there parallels with the stressful situations you've helped service people with?\nNG: Absolutely. If you look at what the language is of the government at the moment it's very much battling the virus and people at the front line so I don't think what we know about military life is exactly the same as what's going on in healthcare or in society as a whole, although the words, 'Blitz spirit' has been used from time to time to describe our population, but there is an awful lot that we can learn from the way that militaries look after people. And one of the things I think that we need to, as a country, start to begin to talk about is when we do get back to whatever the new normal is, and I accept it won't be very normal, is actually the people who have been working incredibly hard are also going to need some time to reintegrate back into whatever the next sort of workplace is. And in an occupational health sense we call that a graded return to work. In a military sense we know that when we send people on deployments for many months at a time and ask them to do incredibly difficult things we don't just bring them home on a Tuesday and ask them to come back to work on a Thursday, we take a staged, progressive approach over a period of a few weeks to allow them to come back into work once they've psychologically and physically reset. And I think we need to think about how we do that whenever lockdown begins to recede otherwise we risk breaking people who have already been working as hard as they can.\nNC: So Rachel we've no idea what this new normal people start to talk about is going to be like, we don't even know really when it's going to happen and at the time of writing we're still fully locked down. Let's just talk about the furloughed because we've got this situation where within organisations we have maybe a high proportion of people who are not working, they're getting 80% of their salary courtesy of the government I mean for now presumably good managers will keep those people in the loop, what can you say about how you start integrating again when more people return to the full-time workforce?\nRS: We'll yes it is important even though we don't know the exact, concrete measures that the government will introduce to start easing the lockdown, we do know that there are certain measures and areas that employers need to start thinking about and preparing their workforce for now. And furlough is one situation, bringing back furloughed employees, but it's clear that there will be a number of different scenarios in terms of the workforce that employers will need to take into account. Hopefully most employers will have been keeping in touch with any furloughed employees, because they still have a duty of care for their health and wellbeing. So hopefully they will have been communicating to bring them back. Some employers will have been making difficult decisions, possibly about redundancy.\nSo we know that whatever the situation and the steps to any easing health and safety and keeping people safe and reassuring them that the organisation has got their health and safety at heart, is going to be really crucial. And then we know that keeping the infection under control is still going to be very, very important. So that has to be the starting point for every employer.\nNC: So Andrea Winfield you've been thinking about this I'm sure at Microsoft and it starts with the simplest thing like would you let your employees in a city get on the tube or a metro railway?\nAW: Yeah I have to say I'm really quite intimidated and I'm sure every HR leader is feeling the same way about making decisions about when to bring people back to work and how to do so safely. We're still working through our approach right now but based on what I've read and have learned I think there are a few things that I think as HR leaders we're all considering. One is clearly the return to work is going to have to be phased. I doubt that many employers can bring people all back at once. We're going to have to involve employees in making that choice too. So some people may not want to return or may not feel, for whatever reason, that it's safe to do so. And I think an element of choice in this is going to be important.\nThere's the matter of making sure we have enough health and safety supplies and protective equipment for key workers is tough enough without employers also adding to the burden of the demand for those types of resources. Topics around self-certification, around health screening, the privacy related to that, is all something as health professionals and HR professionals that we're working through. Not to mention things like social distancing at work, it's not the matter of going back to the office that we had prior to this, even the subject of social distancing in toilets was something I never imagined I'd have a conversation on. But what's safe to do in an office, let alone travel and other very obvious things. So it's clear that whatever we're going back to and whenever we're going back to it is going to be markedly different than the organisation and premises that we left.\nNC: I have to say that working through all this Neil Greenberg sounds to me as difficult, if not more difficult than the job managers have at the moment.\nNG: Yeah I certainly think it's a challenge for managers, as it is a challenge for everyone else in society generally. I think as long as the workforce feels that their management have got their back and have put their interests at heart and so they're not just looking to try and recoup the profits that they haven't made over the last few months that will help. We are in this all together, whether we like it or not, and actually as long as people at work feel that I think they'll hopefully forgive managers for not making the right decision every time because it's not always clear what the right decision is.\nI think one point that is important to note, there's been a mention about the use of screening, now that term's used in lots of different ways but it's really important to recognise that actually trying to do psychological health screening within organisations has been shown not to be helpful. It doesn't necessarily cause harm but we've shown through again good randomised control, high quality trials that actually when you try and get an organisation to ask its employees to fill out questionnaires or to see healthcare professionals in order to try and identify if they've got a problem or not, it doesn't work. People feel suspicious,. They don't tell the truth and also it doesn't properly measure the symptoms that you need to.\nSo I think there's a huge role for organisations providing supportive environments and access to appropriate services but psychological health screening within an organisational setting should not be something that people should be investing time and effort into because the evidence really doesn't support it's helpful.\nNC: The other aspect of this Rachel Suff is maybe people have seen just some benefits about how they've had to work, obviously more homeworking is an obvious one, no commuting, we've seen all this community cooperation and in a way you can project some kind of positive onto the future and think well we've learnt a different way of living, yes as we've already heard the reality is companies will be struggling to survive they're not going to want to change how they work but many employees might think they ought to?\nRS: I mean that's a really good point and I think if organisations and individuals as well can squeeze any kind of positive future out of this situation, this crisis, then that's all to the good because I think a lot of people have been thrown into working from home full-time for example and that might have changed their expectations about what they want from work. Likewise I think many employers and managers will hopefully realise that they can manage a remote workforce and there's been a big learning curve for many of those I'm sure. But I think what this all spells is that when we do have a phased, staged, gradual return to work we will find that people's expectations will have changed quite a lot, because as Andrea said this isn't the same workplace that people will be returning to.\nSo I think there needs to be a lot of readjustment and allowances for people. People's own situations might have changed quite a lot so there needs to be a lot of sensitivity and support for people as they orientate back into the workplace, a very different workplace as Andrea said.\nNC: Okay Rachel Suff that's an excellent final thought from you. Let me just ask Neil and Andrea to just add literally a couple of comments before we finish.\nNG: I think the only last thing I think it's worth saying is actually many of us actually might find that actually being out of the workplace, away from difficult workplace relationships with managers or with colleagues, actually although it's been pressurised it's actually a bit of a relief and so I think we do have to think that as we go back into whatever sort of workplace it is those already strained relationships may be strained further, so I think organisations just need to remind themselves of what things were like beforehand to make sure they take account of that going forward as well.\nAW: I think togetherness is something that's just really important. I don't think employers can do this on their own, neither do I think managers can do this on their own and I think managers and employees and teams and individuals, we all need to come together and figure out how to make this next stage and how to keep talking and how that dialogue must continue as we go forward. I think there's a lot of goodness that can actually come out of this terrible and tragic scenario, I mean we've smashed so many ceilings about flexible working and mobile and virtual working, especially in regulated industries where it felt impossible and I think we're seeing ten years of digital transformation and workplace transformation happening over ten weeks. And there's a lot of opportunity that can be capitalised that will benefit employers and employees alike.\nNC: Well thanks very much indeed for that and to all of you: Andrea Winfield, from Microsoft; Professor Neil Greenberg at the March on Stress Consultancy; and the CIPD's own Rachel Suff.\nOn this topic just time for a couple of your comments that we got after last month's COVID podcast: Svetlana at RSI London clearly has no hang-ups about sharing moments with work colleagues to kick off meetings, she says, yesterday it was photos from their childhood and next apparently they're doing team yoga. I don't know Andrea, Neil and Rachel are up for a bit of yoga now but as Giles from the Hitchhikers Guide to HR told us this is an opportunity for HR to do things to make the future right. Well it's a big responsibility. Until next time from me Nigel Cassidy and all of us at the CIPD goodbye and keep safe.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:25:11\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: We're all in this together but is your organisation showing its true colours? Help is at hand, this is the CIPD's coronavirus survival podcast.\nHello I'm Nigel Cassidy. So how was your day trying to make sense of ever-changing crisis decisions that you have to make work; maybe breaking bad job news; putting staff on government furloughs or worse; or trying to gee up a scattered, isolated and scared workforce? And yes all this when people managers are worried about their own family's health, about feeding, finances and future employment. Some in HR will be glad that they previously did some disaster planning but we all sense that when this finally eases the world of work will never be quite the same again.\nJoining me online three top guests with unique insights on business survival in the age of COVID-19, each suitably holed up I know not where. Jaimini Lakhani is of , Lumiere Consulting, she was on the crisis team dealing with the transatlantic bomb scare at Heathrow in 2006, the one that changed the way we travel. She was also head of organisational engineering for Terminal 5 and has helped a string of big named companies redesign how they do things.\nNext look busy because here comes the boss it's our CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese who writes and speaks widely on the future of work, leadership, people and skills.\nBut first let's go to someone from a PS4bn fresh food business in the eye of the storm David Frost is Director of Organisational Design at Total Produce, who work in 39 countries bringing fruit and veg, exotic and otherwise, from field and farm to consumer.\nDavid let me start with you, it's been fascinating to see this new overnight respect that we have for the people who can't work from home and have to soldier on keeping us supplied. I mean really they come next on the list don't they after NHS workers?\nDavid Frost: Yeah that's right I mean it's been a massive change, an incredibly rapid change and in our business we do have a combination of people that can work from home, can work remotely, but also we have a lot of our colleagues who need to stay within our operations to grade the produce that we supply and to pack the produce, and of course distribute it onwards to our customers. So it's a real mixed situation for us. And we've also had huge volumes going through the business that supplies our retail customers as well. We've all seen the huge demand that retailers have been put under with the supply of food. So we've got a situation where some colleagues have very quickly adapted to working from home using technology very, very quickly, and then others who are going in but looking after themselves, wearing protective equipment wherever possible, to obviously protect themselves from infection.\nSo yeah it's something that's affected us all over the world. We saw it happening in our markets in Italy very quickly, where we operate, and then coming through Spain, and of course then we're monitoring it very closely as it develops into the UK, Ireland and the US.\nNC: Now Jaimini the rest of us either have no work or we're trying to work from home and we know that the CIPD polling says that there's a lot of anxiety about that and that's the worst problem, not least because of those school closures, now it's obviously partly about the available technology but give us some thoughts about how you think organisations are managing this so far and how they could make this scattered working a bit more productive?\nJaimini Lakhani: It's a really good question. Interestingly I thought that I would have quite a lot of difficulty doing the work that I do in terms of organisation design, if you ask any organisation design specialist they will tell you that what they really want to do is they want to get a feel for the place and getting a feel for the place is about being in that place, being able to experience the multi-sensory of doing that. But I have two clients at the moment, one in Singapore, I was actually due to fly out there early February, and very early on when we started to see the escalation of the virus in Singapore my client and I decided to cancel my visit to Singapore but decided to go ahead. So we charted new waters really to be able to do organisation design with me sitting in the UK trying to work with the client team in Singapore. And for that entire project we used the Google platform, we used Zoom technology, we did semi-workshops. So I think what I'm finding is when there is no other option that really clients and colleagues are adapting and they're finding different ways in which to communicate. So I've used WebEx, I've used the good old telephone, I've used Zoom, I've used the Google platform. And we're all getting a lot more proficient I think with different technologies.\nNC: Okay well let's go to Peter Cheese. I've seen managing remote workers being described as conducting an orchestra without seeing or hearing any of the musicians, I mean clearly some organisations have always had remote working but suddenly it's forced on everybody and there's this scattered workforce\nPeter Cheese: Yeah it creates of course different management challenges as Jaimini has touched on but it's also true to say of course many organisations have had some parts of their workforce or some workers working in remote ways. But, oh my goodness, is this the biggest trial of homeworking that we've ever had and it is of course stretching us in lots of ways. But I think that it's also calling out some very fundamental things which are important to leadership and management everywhere. Our ability to remain connected to people; to care and worry about their welfare, because this is not just about the work they do but recognising that their mental health and wellbeing is all of our responsibility, so there are all the technologies, as Jaimini said, but it is I think really calling out the need for some very fundamental good management and leadership practice which is to keep in touch, keep connected, to share things and to use technology to make all those things happen and work for us in different ways.\nSo there's no doubt we're all learning and I think there's a lot of debate about will we all go back to the old ways of working or what are we going to take forwards, because sometimes you need a crisis to jolt us all into a different way of thinking. And I think a lot of the barriers to flexible and home working have not been about technology they've been a lot more about our cultures and our ways of thinking and very long-established paradigms of work which begin with an idea of presenteeism to your point that managers don't feel that they can trust what their employees are doing or know what they're doing unless they can see them in front of them. And that has to change. It had to change anyway and this crisis is demanding that we think differently and connect with our people and understand how they're working in these different ways.\nDF: Yes I mean I completely agree with everything that's been said. We've seen some really interesting mindset shifts I think where people who've historically travelled regularly during the week, they'll jump on a plane into different parts of Europe or North America and people are already saying, 'Do you know we can do this differently, we don't need to keep doing that. Isn't it amazing how effective that Zoom meeting was,' and people are actually finding they're quite enjoying it, which is really interesting. So that's a really big shift.\nThe other thing that I've noticed is, for example speaking with a colleague yesterday in Hamburg who has responsibility for a German operation and an Italian operation, he's staying in really close contact with our colleagues in Italy who are now homeworking and he's been really, really conscientious to run regular Zoom meetings, they'll have coffee breaks and informally chat about how the family's doing, really, really working hard at that. But he's noticed three cycles he's describing. He said that the first week or ten days people were finding this quite novel, they were quite enjoying it actually, it was nice to have the time at home and do a few things that perhaps you wouldn't do. The second phase was normality, it's kind of normal now, we're getting used to this, it's fine. And he's just noticing now as things are moving on that colleagues are starting to feel a little bit perhaps removed. They're seeking company. He had one individual, for example, that's moved in with a larger group of her family because she needs to be with some people and starting to get a little bit agitated as to when do you think this is going to start to change? When can I have some human contact again? So I think it's an interesting one. People are making use of technology but there's that human side as well that we're seeing which I think is worth perhaps just noting.\nNC: Now Jaimini Lakhani I'd like to turn to what I think's maybe one of the trickiest issues for people professionals, it's how you handle situations where your legal or your professional duty overrides your caring instincts, you know when you're obliged to deliver bad news to people, and the CIPD tell us that these decisions do weigh on people very heavily.\nJL: I mean I guess if I can just touch on the human aspect of it I think one of the interesting things that I'm finding is because we all have a commonality with regards to the Coronavirus in terms of what we're dealing with and so naturally as I'm approaching clients that I've never seen before, that I've never met before and all of a sudden there's this automatic common denominator to be able to connect with each other in a very human way, with such a serious topic as it is in and of itself. So I think that has been quite interesting to me to watch the dynamics of talking to different leadership teams.\nNC: Well okay you're taking quite an optimistic view of that but Peter Cheese organisations are often making quite hasty decisions, this accountability really is making people feel quite isolated, I mean there's so little time to think and an overwhelming urgency to act. So how do you balance those two sides of your roll?\nPC: Yeah it's a really important question because you're right I mean the realities of the current situation, indeed the other economic cycles where you're forced into a position of having to make these very tough choices about potentially letting people go engender very difficult conversations. But you can do them in human ways too. I mean I've worked with organisations that have gone through downsizing in the past and come out of it with more trust in the organisation, not less, because of the way they've gone about it, the way they've communicated, the way they've engaged even with the people that are perhaps losing their jobs. So I think in this crisis it's a lot about how you do the right things in the right way and if you have to take the hard choices about redundancy then how do you communicate that effectively and make sure that you are retaining the trust of people.\nAnd I've been saying that I think in these times you've got to balance three really important things as HR professionals. One, of course are the financial imperatives and one of the good things, and we'll probably talk about it a bit more, is that there are new mechanisms being created like furloughing which is allowing us to be able to sustain our workforce even when there's a period of time when historically we'd probably just had to let them go.\nSo you've got the financial imperatives, we've certainly got to understand the legal imperatives, and there are a lot of legal issues in all of this, ranging from consultations and other things which we have to be able to go through effectively. But the third, and equally important, is the ethical or moral. And we've got to balance all of those three things and it's a challenge for us all but I think if we do these things right and do them in the right way and do them ethically and communicate effectively then we can ride out this storm and hopefully emerge stronger in many ways through what is a crisis that's bringing all of these different experiences that we've had as a profession to a head, in one place, at one time with some very, very critical decisions that need to be made very quickly.\nNC: And David Frost we've all seen the reputational damage that can be done if you're too hasty, too cavalier with your workers, and yes Britannia Hotels, Weatherspoon's, Sports Direct bosses we're talking about you!\nDF: Yeah I mean we have been impacted, as I mentioned earlier on, in increased volumes in some respects, so we have colleagues who are working incredibly long hours to fulfil customers' order requirements, that's put people under pressure from a demand point of view, but we also have part of our business that supplies restaurants and catering establishments and of course they've seen volumes drop. So we have had to use the furlough process in that situation with a number of colleagues and really building on Peter's point we absolutely recognise how critical the communication is in terms of how people are dealt with, how we explain the situation, listen to their concerns, but also, I think, another important point is staying in regular contact with those colleagues as well to update them on the situation so that they feel very much still in contact with the business, they are still part of the business. So I think having that mindset and following that through is really important.\nWe've also seen how creative colleagues have been as well. So for example when we have an area of our business that's maybe underutilised very quickly turning that into a service operation for customers who need help in different ways. So we're utilising assets in a different way and I think that's fantastic.\nThe other area I think that we always see in any crisis is actually how if you're honest with colleagues, you're really open and you listen, share the reality, people are remarkably supportive, remarkably resilient if you treat people with respect. And I think that's where it really just highlights those different leadership styles actually and I think people will look back on today and will remember how they were treated and it's back to what Peter said you can build trust actually at times like this as well.\nSo I've seen the huge pressure that HR colleagues have been particularly put under who were trying to really quickly learn about legal issues they've never had to deal with before, consult very quickly and consult remotely. And I think perhaps you'll want to remember those colleagues as well who have been really at the front line and incredibly challenged.\nNC: Jaimini people are being forced to do things differently, creatively, I mean my doctor sent me for an x-ray, got me drugged up and sorted out all on the phone and I mean why go back to the cumbersome old system? There's a pub near us which is closed but it's sending out not-for-profit cooked pub meals to isolated people, a fiver a go. We've had car engineers designing and making ventilators, booze firms making sanitiser, coffee shops turning into grocers, how can we try and hold on to this kind of creativity?\nJL: Well I think what we're seeing now is incredible creativity, incredible innovation. I think when we're pressed to really look at our processes, look at how we do things, and from an organisation design standpoint we're always working with organisations to say, think about your core activities, think about what's really essential, think about your critical decisions. Let's think about who needs to make them. And so really an interesting scenario when you're not pressed with a crisis you tend to take more time but of course some of the choices and decisions that businesses are making, individuals are making, even more organisations, I mean in many cases we can see it, these are a matter of life and death and when you're really pushed to it you can find ways to really streamline those processes.\nSo I hope there will be a calibration, an ability to look back at some of those activities, the way in which teams have worked together, the what worked, what didn't, and really try and build in that innovation into the processes. I think people are experiencing a very different way of working. And I think humans are resilient. I think we'll come back from that and we'll make better choices about how we do things better going forward. That's my hope.\nNC: Peter all this is pretty raw at the moment is it too soon for organisations to learn from everything that's happening to them?\nPC: No I don't think it is. I think we're already learning things. I mean I've heard people comment that if it all blew over and we went back to work next week even would we not take forward some of these learnings from things that we've already talked about like agile working, remote working, and think about these things differently? So I don't think it's too early, but of course there are many other things that I think can emerge from this crisis that could be very positive.\nThe idea of the centrality of humanity at work and wellbeing, people being treated as whole people, flexible working we've talked about, a lot of these sorts of ideas which they're not new and we've been talking about them arguably for too long but not seen enough really systemic change. And I think it's that old adage of don't let a good crisis go to waste, this crisis will drive, I'm absolutely sure of it, some really fundamental rethinks about what's important.\nAnd at the end of the day what could be more important than people and how you treat them, how you manage them, you're building the trust, you're getting the best out of them and you're understanding them as people and supporting them as individuals. And I think it's those sorts of things that will be very central to what we learn along with recognising we can do some extraordinary things. It doesn't always have to be a crisis to make this an event to think differently but a crisis as Jaimini said can help us innovate much more.\nSo I think we've got a long way to go for sure but I think we're already seeing signs of things which I think will endure as positive changes in the workplace.\nNC: David Frost I was intrigued to see more than one mention of solidarity on your Total Produce website. I mean your company's a tough, global player but let's try and draw some conclusions here. I want to get a bit more of this sense of a new mood, it's like the new politics, it's almost as if pure business goals are bowing to something a bit bigger?\nDF: Yes I mean it's absolutely true, our group CEO released a communication out to the whole group last week and made direct reference actually to the greater purpose in our organisation, for example, around providing healthy food to people and how critical that is at a time like this. And I just think that's something that's tied everyone together, it's reminded everybody of what they bring to the wider community and it's fascinating to see how people have just connected with each other an awful lot more and I've just noticed people making a call or a video conference just to see how are you doing and just to have a chat in a way that I may not have seen somebody for a month now I'm speaking with them every other day just to make sure you're okay. And I just think it has shifted those mindsets.\nI've also just noticed as well, I was in a meeting today with three other colleagues, we had a two hour Zoom meeting and we've never done it before with this particular team and two or three occasions during this two hour session people just paused and said, 'Isn't this good? Isn't this working well?' but the other thing we said was, 'What have we noticed?' What we noticed is that people were listening a lot more carefully. We noticed that if we'd been in a room together people would interrupt a little bit more but with this technology you have to kind of give people their space and listen. We realised that interruption disrupts the whole process. People were asking really great questions as well.\nSo it just made us think about those coaching skills we perhaps had been taught a few years ago we need to brush up on those a little bit and naturally use those a little bit more in the way that we're working as well. So just two or three things that people have noticed that are different and I hope that will continue as well.\nNC: Well Jaimini Lakhani this is really nothing new is it this notion that successful organisations have goals beyond the pure profit motive? But what I want to know is how do organisations try and bottle what they're achieving?\nJL: My sense is that because this has become so interconnected, not just within organisations but organisations interconnected with other organisations outside of their own boundaries, so in this time of crisis where people are working together with their own companies but linking into humanity, understanding the dependencies that we all have on each other, even strangers, for this particular cause, my sense is that we're all going to have imprinted in our minds this organisational memory.\nWhereas previously we might have thought that the decisions were made by management or by leadership and I think all of us are having a leadership lesson because we're not only having to manage our own personal wellbeing, our family wellbeing, but we're coming together as communities. And my sense is that that's going to leave a lasting imprint in our minds and so how do we bottle it? I think we're bottling it every day. I think our behaviours are changing and almost by that very nature we won't go back to the way that we were because it'll just be habit, it'll be ingrained behaviours.\nNC: And meanwhile Peter Cheese what can the government, what can organisations do to make sure that as many people as possible are upheld to at the very least return to their organisations when all this is over?\nPC: Yeah I think first of all the government, it's been encouraging to see how much, you know we've all recognised the health crisis is very rapidly leading into the biggest economic crisis that we've known and one of the really important things the government's been talking a lot about everywhere is that we need to make sure that businesses can bounce back and when we get past the crisis that they can recover quickly and therefore providing these pay subsidy schemes and so forth to help organisations to find other ways to hold onto their employees, even where the demand has dropped significantly, are a very important part of that.\nAnd there are still some details to be worked through and lots of questions and things like the furloughing schemes, but we know from our own work that the majority of companies are now looking at furloughing and even where they'd made redundancies in the first rush of concern at the beginning of this crisis in sectors like hospitality, even there they're looking at saying, 'Well actually I could bring those people back onto my books. I could furlough them, they don't have to be made redundant.'\nSo this is a time when we're all having to work together. We are all in this together and government's response to step up in ways that we've never seen to support businesses, support the economy, as well as of course support the health of our people, are two really, really critical aims and objectives. So it will be fascinating to see if this really does continue for a longer period of time do we end up with more nationalised industries where whole sectors or industries are having to be bailed out, to use the language of the last financial crisis, we don't know yet. But what we are seeing is I think governments everywhere recognising that you have to do all you can to step in to avert, as far as possible, huge damage on people's jobs and livelihoods as well as of course protecting them from the health side.\nAnd businesses need to respond to that. And as I said before one of our challenges in the profession and something we're trying to do all we can as the CIPD is to understand all these different schemes and understand all these different options and what are the right choices to make in response to the crisis and what's right for my business. And that's challenging but we've got more options now in terms of sustaining our workforce than probably we've ever had before. And that's something we all need to work on.\nNC: So what are we taking from what we've heard here? Well certainly for me we're all being forced to prioritise, to look outwards and not inwards and people professionals have never been more important in supporting a worried workforce. Let's just thank Jaimini Lakhani of Lumiere Consulting; David Frost from Total Produce and the CIPD's chief Peter Cheese.\nDo let us have your thoughts and comments through the usual CIPD channels, or LinkedIn is good and don't forget to keep checking that CIPD website, there's loads of constantly updated Coronavirus resources and stuff like government aid, sick leave, furlough decisions, legal responsibilities, a ton of other things.

      "summary": "Traditional organisation development (OD) skills are becoming increasingly embedded within the DNA across all aspects of the people profession today – this is highlighted in the new Profession Map from the CIPD. In what way, then, can OD practice be integrated throughout the people practice ecosystem? How can people practitioners adopt traditional OD roles and responsibilities in their workplace?\nJoin Dr Linda Holbeche, co-director of The Holbeche Partnership, and Caroline Nugent, HR Director at the Financial Ombudsman, as they delve into the role of organisation architects – the OD professionals – whose job is to explore the ways organisations can benefit from OD practice, and the key challenges they may face in doing so.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:17:05\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Hello. In this edition we're od'ing on OD, short for Organisational Development. What is it? Why does it matter? I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nWelcome. If the HR professional's job's to get the best out of a workforce it's the organisational development and design types within it who have to delve deeper into the organisation to find out what makes it tick. That's beyond everyday concerns like recruitment, training, rewards, and all the admin that goes with being a people professional. It's the strategic stuff around how your place actually functions or ought to function to achieve its goals. So this CIPD podcast is all about the dark arts of OD: that's adapting, improving and evolving an organisation so it can deliver on its goals so it can grow and advance.\nWell here with me at CIPD headquarters to help us with this Linda Holbeche, co-director of The Holbeche Partnership, widely acknowledged as an influential thought and practice leader in this field. Hello.\nLinda Holbeche: Hello.\nNC: And Caroline Nugent, HR Director at the Financial Ombudsman Service, who's held some key directorships in public organisations and joined the CIPD board last April. Hello.\nCaroline Nugent: Hello.\nNC: Well Linda, can we start with a tiny bit of history? I know from the CIPD website that organisational development came out of the US in the 1940s, in the 1950s, and it seems to have its roots in all kinds of thought and practice, behavioural science, sociology, even psychotherapy, so what is it?\nLH: Well as you say the history of it is very rich but fundamentally it's the applied field of organisational dynamics. It's how groups work; it's how organisations work as a system and how they adapt to the environment in which they're operating but the history is rich and diverse because the origins of it back in the 40s, and even before that, were given a boost if you like by the terrible tragedies that befell people during the Second World War.\nA lot of the leading thinkers at the time like Kurt Lewin wanted to understand how it was that when you put groups of people together, groupthink can lead to disastrous behaviours and choices, just as they can lead to very positive behaviours. So he wanted to understand that and developed a range of ways of understanding and applying processes to help people understand each other better.\nNC: So Caroline Nugent I mentioned at the beginning that OD goes a bit deeper than just the plain vanilla HR, so does everybody actually recognise that it is a tool and it's something that should be there to be used when change is needed?\nCN: I don't think necessarily, I think some people drop into it by default. I think there are some organisations that don't particularly understand what OD is and will see it as, this is HR, do your change, do your restructure but don't understand the background to it, particularly around the change aspects, so I think that's something that some organisations, and I think from a professional point of view have we really sold what OD is enough? As you say it's been going for many, many years now and I think there is still some misunderstanding of what it actually involves and what it is.\nNC: Do you agree with that?\nLH: I do. And I think it's very interesting that as, in the current time, we're in such a period of rapid transition, I mean at least everybody recognises that, what with technology, political uncertainty, economic uncertainty etc. there's a real awareness that the old business models don't work as well as they used to do and organisations and working practices are going to have to change very quickly and the awareness is growing that we don't know how to make these changes.\nSo consequently lots of organisations I come across have suddenly appointed people to OD roles who previously were minding their own business in L&D roles or HR roles and not necessarily having exposed them to the kind of skills development and experience that would be handy in that role. So a lot of people I think are struggling a bit with it.\nNC: Caroline I must say I'm a bit foggy about the difference between the normal HR function and OD?\nCN: So I think HR, as you were saying earlier, recruitment is a good example. So we will look at we need x position, let's go and recruit it, I think from the OD bit is what's going to happen longer term and what changes do we need so we could just recruit a HR professional for example or an architect, for example? But actually longer term what does it mean the organisation wants?\nAnd I think again as a profession we've wanted to get at the table, being that word that people have put in quite a lot, but have we been that strategic or have we challenged? Have we the agile, the adaptability? Have we really challenged what an organisation wants from its OD going forward? And I think that's part of the challenge from HR.\nNC: And a lot of people also talk about design as well as development. Is there any fundamental difference? Are the two Ds the same?\nLH: They're related but in my view they are different. They're both systemic, so for example, as Caroline was saying, if you're trying to develop more innovation, speed things up, etc. you need to look at the whole organisation, not only at a specific chunk of it. And very often that leads on to what used to be called the McKinsey 7s or the Peters 7s, the system, strategy etc. And what for me distinguishes the design pieces is that that's looking at the so-called hard triangle or structures, systems and strategy more specifically. And very often there's a neglect, if it's done by external consultants, of the so-called soft S which is the staff and the shared values and all that kind of thing, which is where organisation development in particular comes in. So for me you can't design if you want it to succeed without development but you can do development without design. It depends what you're trying to achieve.\nCN: I agree totally with that because I think part of the challenge in the past is we've brought in a transformational expert so there's been this expectation that you bring somebody in, they can transform the organisation, they go, but they've not necessarily understood the culture of the organisation and then how you do that change, but a sustained change. And as you say the people aspect of change is the biggest thing.\nNC: So talk me through the nitty gritty then: the change has been designed, the architecture has been done, what are the OD people who are in-house, who've got to make it work, what are they doing? Are they mainly persuading people to follow the new rules? Are they talking the management about implementation? What are they physically doing all day?\nCN: I think it's again wider than that. It's all aspects of that but it has to be at that strategic level. It's got to be top down and implementing day to day decisions such as if you're doing a job redesign, again you can change somebody's job, if somebody wants to they can unpick that job. So it's the perseverance, it's the going round, you can't just put in one thing like an L&D programme and expect that the change things going forward. It's the constant reviewing, almost the ROI of it, the why, the what, those kind of things. If you don't put that in it again just becomes one aspect you do to somebody and they can unpick if they want to, whether that be a manager or an employee.\nNC: Okay. And I want to ask you both this, does it take a particular kind of animal to do this work? Are there people who are really good at it or is it something that ends up just being given to somebody and they may nor may not have the skills?\nLH: Well I think it depends on your starting point. Some people do come with a kitbag of skills, particularly if they've got a learning and development background, which enables them to both understand some aspects of group dynamics and apply them to things like team development and conflict management, if they're trained in mediation, or whatever. But fundamentally for me it depends on what level of OD activity you're engaging in. If you're, in a way, focusing on the really strategic elements, such as Caroline has outlined you really do need to understand the business and how it operates. You need to understand its processes and how they might be improved.\nYou also need confidence and credibility with senior management because by and large if you're going to shift the culture of the organisation and the ways of working you have to really start with the people at the top because they, in a sense, mandate everything else and they model everything else. So that's not an easy call, even for some very experienced HR directors. And I think there's also, just as with HR professionals, the pressure is on to be evidence-based, I think that's also true of OD professionals who are often one and the same, to be able to marshal their data, pinpoint where to make a start on shifting a culture and process to something more healthy.\nCN: And as you say that credible partner, that being known in the organisation that you will challenge senior leaders, that credibility of being able to say some things that perhaps some people don't want to hear when they're particularly at a very senior level, that truth to power type scenario, I think that's critical for an OD or the multi-tasking HR, OD partner.\nNC: So how do you handle things if you've been handed this hot potato, it's not going well, senior management just want to see results, they want to see the organisation's goals reached, how do you handle that, particularly if you've not a lot of experience in OD?\nCN: Part of it is obviously looking at things like the CIPD profession map. I mean if you want to learn what it is you've got to understand it. So part of it is your self-reflection. But I think it's also important that you go and ask everybody, bottom up, what's not working? So again it's challenging why something has not taken place and being comfortable to ask everybody, so ask some of the people that have had this done to them rather than been part of the journey.\nAnd then that truth to power bit, go and explain why it's not working. And you may have to unpick and go back. I think HR professionals, if you look an act from HR you want to find a solution and you want to bring it in, the OD professional wants to embed it and then ongoing. We like to see things happen quick because we're all so busy and we want to move onto the next thing. In OD it's the embeddingment [sic] of it because as creatures of habit we will go back if we can to what it was like before, because, as Linda said, we don't particularly like change.\nNC: Now Linda a lot of people like to talk about an ecosystem don't they? We've already heard a word about learning and development and other aspects of HR, so give us a sense of where organisational development fits with everything the people professionals do?\nLH: Well I think there are considerable overlaps but there are some distinct areas at the same time. So for instance I think L&D and HR and OD have all got concerns for developing a healthy working environment. I think HR particularly is concerned about all aspects of the employee experience from recruitment to exiting, if need be, and engagement of course is part of that. Learning and development they're really key to enabling people to develop the skills they need in this very fast-changing environment. The cross-skilling and up-skilling that's required.\nOD for me takes the most systemic view of the lot. It in a sense has to enable some sort of integrated view involving all aspects of the HR profession but also senior management, about what it is we might need to do as an organisation to survive and thrive in this changing environment. And that may mean making difficult business cases, it may mean delving deeply into those very uncomfortable areas for the organisation, issues to do with cultural blockages, power and so on.\nAnd in that sense I think ultimately the OD function is, without being change management in the conventional sense, I'm not saying that's an admission of failure, because change management in the conventional sense as in project management, is often very much needed, but it's very much about enabling an organisation to dynamically adjust and adapt and knowing how to make that happen. And to be honest HR and learning and development are in a sense obliged to focus on the here and now and the immediate requirements of the business and OD has to pick up the cudgel of and let's see how we use the short term to develop the long term.\nNC: I get all that. That's a kind of ideal situation but as the HR function shrinks in many organisations is there not the danger that all the OD stuff just gets swallowed up? It's kind of what the top management think HR do?\nCN: There is absolutely a risk of that, and it doesn't matter whether you're private or public sector, the here and now is very important. It's no good coming up with something that's going to take five years in a private sector organisation that may be gone in two years because its bottom line has been affected. So you have to multi-skill and I think even more so now because HR, as a support service, as the backbone often is shrinking in organisations.\nSo for me the most senior person within HR has to be supported by people that want to do that change, that know as a profession you've got to deal with the here and now because you have to be sustainable, but you have got to keep pushing at the boundaries and getting people to realise if we don't do x this is what's going to happen.\nSo recruitment is a good example. You could do mass recruitment and basically get people on seats but actually are they the long term sustainability? What is it you need? What behaviours do you need to be a sustainable organisation?\nNC: So where's it going in the future? Is this a good discipline to be in?\nLH: I think so. It's certainly not going to become irrelevant, far from it. The challenge is growing enough people with the awareness of what it involves and with the skills to contribute, whether they're people in HR or L&D roles who adopt and OD mindset, approach their day to day work in that way, it's not going to go away, if anything through every aspect of the HR function it's possible to do this agile way of approaching OD which is take two steps forward, reflect, what works, take forward and grow from there, bit by bit. Build your allies. Start to create momentum, start to produce some results. And if you've got two or three choices, choose the one that's likeliest to produce future benefits as well as the present benefits.\nCN: And I think for me, from a professional point of view are the HR profession able to work in the ambiguity that's needed going forward? And I think that's a critical thing that we need to reflect on personally as to whether you can look to see what you don't know is out there and work and work in that risk-based approach because you do not know what's coming round the corner. And as the professional person you've got to be able to give confidence both to employees and managers that don't worry there is a solution to this. We may have to work out a few things but ultimately there is a way of getting through it. So being able to work in ambiguity to me is critical.\nNC: Okay well that seems a good point to end on. We're coming to the end of our time on this so what can we take away? Well it's been said many times that people don't so much dislike change they dislike being changed, so it must follow that good OD is about evolving an organisation's architecture, as we've heard, so people can see what they do and how they do it does matter, and come to embrace change instead of fighting it.\nAs always there's resources on the CIPD website.

      "summary": "There are currently 5 million workers in the UK (1 in 7 of the workforce) juggling work with care responsibilities. That number is set to increase. Working carers say their responsibility for another causes significant worry and anxiety, so much so, that it can feel like being a ‘rabbit caught in the headlights’. Employers should start developing an understanding and awareness of the issue, in order to provide the best support and retain valuable employees.\nJoin Katherine Wilson, Head of Employment, Carers UK and Claire McCartney, Senior Policy Adviser, CIPD as we explore the impact of caring responsibilities on workers and what measures employers can put in place to better support their working carers.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:17:53\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: Is your place losing valuable people because needy relatives or friends just can't manage at home without care? Did you even know some workers juggle their caring secretly fearing that going public could damage their careers. I'm Nigel Cassidy and this is the CIPD podcast.\nHello, yes our hot topic this month balancing work and care. Why now? Well we're heading into what's been a forecast silver tsunami, when the tally of elderly will far exceed the number of family members available to care for them. Five million of us in the UK currently juggle work and caring responsibilities, that's about one in seven of the workforce. And it's thought that nine million people may be needed within 30 years. So with fewer young people starting work it's a no-brainer to have more of a care for the carers and enable them to stay on board in the workforce.\nWell alongside me for this month's podcast from the home team, Claire McCartney, the CIPD's senior policy adviser for resourcing and inclusion.\nClaire McCartney: Hello.\nNC: And we're delighted to welcome Katherine Wilson, head of employment for Carers UK, a national membership charity which is a support network and a movement for change.\nKatherine Wilson: Good morning.\nNC: Hello. So Katherine let's start with you from Carers UK, let's get a bit of a handle on the scale and nature of the problem. I guess people just suddenly become working carers without knowing that's going to happen?\nKW: Yes very often that is the case. You can really become a carer overnight. So people talk about really facing a crisis where they just don't know where to turn for information or help.\nNC: And of course the trouble is that sometimes those carers can't cope, they become non-working carers and it's very difficult.\nCM: That's right I think the figure is around one in six that have to actually leave the workforce because of their caring responsibilities so it's really crucial that organisations are properly supporting working carers and not losing out on that valuable talent.\nNC: Is it generally older people at work that find themselves in this situation?\nKW: Well anyone can become a carer at any time but we know that the peak age for caring is usually around age 45 to 64, but having said that a lot of younger people are definitely now juggling work and care and particularly the so-called 'sandwich generation', people often aged say 40 to 50 who've got childcare responsibilities but also are looking after an elderly mum or dad as well.\nNC: And there is a certain shame attached to being a carer, people do tend to not only hide it from their employers even from their colleagues.\nCM: I think also the issue is that some carers don't necessarily identify themselves as a carer, so in some of the previous research that we've done people talk about just helping others, doing their duty, so actually it's really important that organisations have a clear definition of what a working carer is in order to enable to help people open up about that and create a culture where people don't feel that there's a stigma attached to talking about being a carer in the workplace.\nNC: So Katherine talk us through a typical situation when somebody becomes a carer, how does it impinge on their life at work?\nKW: Well carers in our networks tell us that it feels like being a rabbit in the headlines, you know suddenly something happens like mum has a fall, dad has a heart attack, and your world is turned upside down and you just don't know where to go for help or information. You're worried about your loved one and then you're worried about telling someone at work, you're worried about how you're going to keep working. So it can really affect people in that way but also it can sometimes creep up on you unawares and you just realise more and more that you're taking responsibility for caring for an older relative.\nNC: Now Claire McCartney I suppose we might reasonably say this is a problem for society but it does cost employers a lot of money, I think I read somewhere that unplanned absence is already costing employers over PS8bn a year, I think that's taking into account the cost of bringing in other people to do the work that the carers can't do. So give us a sense of how this affects employers, at what point does the HR department get involved?\nCM: So some of the practical issues as a result of people with working and caring responsibilities are that people struggle to juggle those responsibilities, so we might see more absence levels, we might see more people stressed in the workplace. So organisations really need to think about how they can respond to that and how they can get supportive relationships with line managers to spot those signs and think about what are some of the things we can do that would make a difference.\nNC: Presumably people might take a leave, either if they can get short-term leave, or unplanned leave which creates problems.\nCM: There's a legal right to time off for emergencies for dependents but beyond that carers will need more leave than that, so they might be taking their annual leave, which means that that will impact upon their well-being. There'll be other issues there as well, taking sick leave as well. So it's really about spotting those signs and thinking what can we do as employers to prevent that and to promote people's well-being.\nNC: Katherine I was going to ask a bit more about this, what does the law essentially allow in terms of employment or other legislation if you are a carer and you need help?\nKW: Well as Claire said there is the right to time off for dependents for emergencies, which is wider than for carers but can be really helpful. Of course carers can also benefit from the right to request flexible working, which is there for employees with 26 weeks service or more for their employer. If you're a parent having parental leave can really help, particularly if your child's got a disability but also if you're caring for say your mum or dad it gives you a bit more time to juggle time with your family as well.\nAnd then the last right is probably less well known and it's the protection really for unfair discrimination and harassment under the Equality Act, because as a carer you're seen as being associated with someone who's disabled or older because of your caring responsibilities. And that's often around unwitting discrimination where people just don't think that someone's a carer.\nNC: And Claire how clued up are companies on both the rights of their employees and then actually how they're going to respond if somebody comes to the boss and says, 'Look I've got a care problem here?'\nCM: I think organisations are clued up on some of the legal issues that Katherine's just outlined but I think the more overall support package that they can provide to carers, perhaps less so. So thinking about what combination of things like flexible working, flexible leave, will really help to support carers. So I think there's much more thinking that can go into the overall support package for working carers and actually calling out working carers in their policies as well.\nNC: So Katherine is the law adequate at the moment? Are you calling for anything new in your campaigning?\nKW: Well Carers UK has long been campaigning for the right to statutory carer's leave, because there isn't any right at the moment dedicated to supporting carers. We did actually welcome the recent announcement in the Queen's Speech by the Government that there is a commitment to bring forward proposals for carer's leave, so we're waiting to see the detail of that but we welcome the fact that it now does seem to be on the agenda and in our view we prefer it to be paid, but we think it's a great step that it's being introduced and discussed. And our Employers for Carers Forum which has been running now for well over ten years, many of our forward-looking employers are already offering paid carer's leave to their staff.\nCM: And also from the CIPD perspective it's something that we've been calling for in our manifesto as well. So we're calling for five days paid leave for carers and we really think that can help because we know that carers can be struggling financially. If they've had to reduce their hours that will impact upon them. Some will have to use their savings, have to borrow money indeed for some of their caring responsibilities. So there are financial struggles there that really need to be recognised so we're very supportive of that.\nNC: So Claire in terms of how employers up and down the country respond have you any sense of how many have policies and actually implement them?\nCM: Yeah so our research from a couple of years ago showed us that around a quarter of employers have a carers policy and then around 8% have some kind of informal framework in place, but we know that around two fifths don't have a policy and at the time that we did the research they didn't have any plans to put anything in place for working carers and that seems to be a big oversight considering all of the issues we've been talking about and particularly the aging population which means that carers are only going to grow in workforces.\nNC: So Katherine Wilson what does a decent policy look like as far as how a company approaches people with caring issues?\nKW: Well I think there's really three key elements are going to really make a difference. First of all understanding and awareness of the issue and how it can impact your staff and actually having the conversation, encouraging the conversation and visibility in the workplace. Secondly flexibility in all its shapes and forms; it's not just about the formal right to request but all sorts of small flexibilities, ad hoc informal can really help make a difference. And I think thirdly information, being very clear, as Claire has said earlier, about calling out caring issues. So signposting staff to where policies can support them and signposting staff to how they can get help for external help for caring as well, information from organisations like Carers UK and others that can give support and help to carers.\nNC: Are employers, the very senior managers, do you think they're on board with all this? Have they actually grasped why this needs to be worked on?\nCM: Well I think there are some really good exemplars out there and Katherine will be working with many of those that really get the caring agenda but as I said just a quarter have some kind of policy, so there's much more work that needs to be done. And I think it's not just about having a policy in place, it's about really embedding a culture of support and, for us, line manager support is really important there. So it's about educating our line managers to have those sensitive conversations with their employees that have caring responsibilities so that they feel able to talk about that and thinking about what solutions work for them, whether it's flexible leave, whether it's flexible working, all the different things that could make a really big difference and help to support them in the workplace.\nNC: Katherine you must hear stories from your carers about their encounters both with colleagues and with their managers when they try and get support or explain their issues? Have you got anything to say about how companies could handle caring questions better?\nKW: Yes I think that's a really good point. We do have practical examples of where conversations have worked well and where they haven't worked so well and I think again there's three key things that can really make a difference. A line manager who's got a more flexible mindset, who is more open to having the conversation, particularly around flexibility and leave. Secondly a line manager who's informed about how the organisation can support staff. And I think thirdly a line manager who's reflective and responsive and not just reactive, you know very often it's easier just to think no and just panic and not known how to answer, but if you can just have a bit of time and reflect how you might go some way towards meeting the carer's needs then that can really help.\nNC: Claire I wonder whether again those organisations that have been successful, that have worked on these policies, could teach us a bit more about how to actually make that happen?\nCM: Yeah I think that's a really good point so I think organisations that are doing really well in this sphere should be talking and sharing those examples with other people. I think the Government perhaps could do more to share those examples, I know Carers UK are brilliant at sharing good practice examples but it's really about giving people ideas, giving organisations ideas. And sometimes supporting working carers it's not going to cost the earth, you may well have some of these policies in place, but it's just bringing it together, highlighting that we're talking about carers and pointing to the sources that would really make a difference to them that's going to help.\nNC: Claire what about people in the workforce who are maybe younger, millennials we always talk about, who don't have people to care for might they resent because they don't quite understand people being allowed time off for something like that? Do you need to manage them as well?\nCM: Potentially I mean I think colleagues' reactions are really important in this and if you've got supportive colleagues then that's going to make a big difference. So that's the education piece, if we're talking about carers at work, if we've got senior leaders that talk about their caring responsibilities, normalise the agenda, that's going to filter through to people that don't have these experiences. But we should perhaps be talking about this in education as well, this isn't something that gets talked about more generally in society and for younger people in education we know that there are a lot of young carers out there who will have their own issues, so it's really important to raise these issues and talk about carers.\nNC: And of course some people love their pets don't they and it might seem trivial but I did read that some young people were demanding 'pawternity' to look after their pets. I suppose they might feel they're losing out if their employers cut slack only to older carers.\nKW: Well firstly I don't think pets are trivial at all as a cat owner, I think it's part of the family but I think these points are very important and going back to the issue about younger people what we found when we were talking to people in the workplace is that very often younger people can be really concerned about the impact of caring on their own parents, so for example people may say, 'I'm really worried about my mum who's 50-something and still working and her mum's got dementia, so it's my grandmother's got dementia,' but it's affecting the wider family so the younger worker still feels the impact of that.\nNC: So what's the challenge for organisations here then?\nCM: I think the challenge for organisations is if they're not supporting working carers then they're going to be missing out and actually this is something that is going to grow in size in the future so they really need to get on board. If they're not supporting working carers then it's going to impact upon their reputation and that's going to impact upon not only carers in their workforce but the broader workforce, potentially their customers and their clients as well and it will also lead to increased stress levels, absence and sickness, which is going to cause cost to a business but also there's a moral issue here, it's the right thing to do and for us at the CIPD it's about championing better work and working lives and this is a core part of that.\nKW: I'm glad to hear that and I think businesses that have been addressing it have really found the benefits of doing that so they're talking about enhanced retention of talent and skills in the workplace, better resilience of staff, better health and productivity through addressing this. And actually it's also affecting better recruitment and helping return as well. So there's the business benefits as well as it being the right thing to do.\nNC: I just wonder if you could actually test how robust your organisation was going to be if there was a rush of new carers coming into the workforce?\nKW: Caring is a very large, if often hidden, issue, so the chances are you've got a lot of carers already who may not be recognising themselves as carers, it's different from being a parent isn't it, you know a lot of us just don't see ourselves as a carer, we're just a daughter, son, partner, mum or dad, looking after our loved ones. And often it's not a choice it just happens to you so it's really hard to see yourself as a carer.\nNC: Like so many things it's about getting to know your people.\nCM: It's about getting to know your people. It's about line managers having really good relationships with their team so that they feel that they can talk about sensitive issues. And it's about creating that culture. So there's lots of things organisations can be doing to prepare for that, and as Katherine says they will already have lots of working carers within their workforce anyway.\nNC: And both of you if people want to find out more about this topic?\nCM: So the CIPD have got new research coming out and guidance on this and we've been working with Sheffield University and part of an ESRC funded piece of work around sustainable care, which Carers UK have fed into and that will be launched in the next few months, so do watch out for that.\nNC: And lots of resources on the Carers UK website.\nKW: Yes that's carersuk.org and also our employersforcarers.org site has also got examples of good practice and what our employers are doing as well.\nNC: So our conclusion here: there's never been a more important time to focus on helping skilled workers who are also carers, maybe prevent them needing to walk out of the door, better that than incurring the costs of recruiting and training replacements. And we should remember, as always there's policies and reality, organisations can have caring plans all over the place but if workers don't believe they'll get help then they'll just remain under the radar and one day they'll leave.\nWell let me just thank our two brilliant and eloquent guests on this topic Claire McCartney, CIPD's senior policy adviser for resourcing and inclusion, and Katherine Wilson, head of employment for Carers UK.\nBy the way it was great to get your comments on last month's podcast on workplace life in 2020, in particular you did seem to home in our contributor David D'Souza's comment on the business risks of not addressing diversity and inclusion issues in 2020, he'd said 'It's time to make people feel more uncomfortable about things stand.' Well one listener, Dr Ann, commented on LinkedIn, 'I couldn't have said it better.' Well that's very nice we can take criticism too so keep your comments coming.\nJoin us next month as we delve into the world of organisational design and development, exploring what the current state of play looks like and what could be just on the horizon.

      "full_text": "Duration: 00:27:21\nTranscript\nNigel Cassidy: A new year with new opportunities, but tricky challenges too, so here's our guide to some of the biggest issues people professionals might face in 2020 - it's the CIPD podcast.\nWell not just a new year but a new decade, a new government, new politics and even a new voice on your podcast, I'm Nigel Cassidy. So while it lasts let's relish the start of term, blank notebook-like bursting with opportunities feeling. We've assembled a crack team to pick out some of those key challenges we might need to be ready for this year. So let's meet our first guests of 2020.\nBusiness journalist Josie Cox writes for numerous titles like the Wall Street Journal, The Independent and The Guardian. She's often to be seen reviewing papers on the telly box and on occasions, I'm told, co-hosts Jazz FM's Business Breakfast, mm jazz nice!\nEdward Houghton is head of research on thought leadership here at the CIPD. He's interested in how skills, knowledge and experience can drive productivity, innovation and corporate social responsibility. Hello.\nEdward Houghton: Hi there.\nNC: And as a New Year bonus a second guest from the CIPD ranks, David D'Souza is the institute's membership director. He's been described as one of the UK's most influential HR and workplace commentators - not by yourself presumably David?\nDavid D'Souza: Sometimes, my mother mainly.\nNC: Now as somebody once famously said prediction is very difficult, especially when it's about the future, but Josie you get the short straw seeing as you bang on about the business world day in, day out. Let's start very broadly what do you think are the hot topics you think might cross the desk as people professionals in the year 2020?\nJosie Cox: Ah so getting my crystal ball out, never easy as you say but if you're putting me on the spot I think, well, eventually we're going to get to the B word, so I'm going to kick it off early and I'm going to say that Brexit is inevitably going to have a massive impact on everything that happens in the workplace and beyond that as well. Obviously I think that the UK's departure from the European Union will bring in a new era for policies for all kinds of regulation that might shape the workplace but I think far more fundamentally than that I think it will have quite a severe impact on our personal lives just because of the way that politics is becoming so intrinsic to everything we do and workplaces and communities are becoming more polarised. So I think that one of the greatest challenges in 2020 is going to be for managers and organisations to navigate those polarisations and to ensure that if they encourage their workforces to bring their whole selves to work they can also accommodate those political identities, whatever form they might take. So that would be my first thing to look out for.\nNC: Okay so we'll let you have a three part list.\nJC: Okay fantastic. Well I promise I won't be too long. But secondly I think the diversity and inclusion agenda is going to be very dominant again in 2020. Obviously we'll see the third year of gender pay gap reporting coming out so that should cast some interesting light on progress, or lack thereof. The government's consultation on ethnicity pay gap reporting, which could be interesting as well.\nBut I think that more generally it's just D&I is becoming more mainstream. I think employers and organisations are increasingly catching on to the fact that it's not an opt in, it's not optional. D&I has to be a strategic priority for every single organisation. So direction of travel is going to be towards that.\nAnd then very quickly finally an interesting one, I think that the dominance of the millennial in the workplace is going to continue to be an interesting challenge and also an opportunity for employers. Millennials, so those born roughly between 1980 and the mid-1990s, already make up a huge chunk of the labour market and will increasingly do so and they have very particular demands and expectations that can no longer be ignored when it comes to recruiting and retaining talent but also when it comes to ensuring productivity and engagement. So again that will be one of my interesting things to watch in 2020.\nNC: Well Ed will dive into all that in a bit more detail in a moment but just initially these are all clearly very different issues but I suppose they all require organisations to respond to unforeseen or unpredictable events.\nEH: Indeed so they all really present quite challenging conundrums to organisations and in particular leaders in organisations. So Brexit obviously is the key issue that we face as a country and in organisations it's going to be continuing to be an issue for many years to come. Beyond whatever happens in the new year there will still be things that we need to tackle in organisations around practice and policies that we need to actually land for individuals and organisations.\nIt's also a really interesting time to talk about the risks and opportunities that Brexit might provide to our organisations. So whilst obviously we colour Brexit in organisations as a significant risk, there are also organisations who see it as a massive opportunity. And so I think that is a really nice theme to also consider as we move into 2020 and one that I think many leaders will be thinking and hoping that 2020 provides some opportunity through Brexit.\nIn terms of D&I it continues to be a very important agenda for the professional, rightly so, and also for leaders in organisations.\nGender pay gap reporting is a really interesting concept because it seems to be highlighting something. Whether or not you believe the measures themselves at least it's having an opportunity to have a conversation about gender in the workforce and the unfortunate and actually quite damaging differences that people of different genders face in organisation, in particular around pay.\nAnd ethnicity as well is going to be an interesting one because, unlike gender where it is fairly easy to collect the data, ethnicity is much, much harder. Whether or not it can actually be pulled off in terms of good quality reporting we'll wait and see but we need a workplace conversation about ethnicity in particular at the senior ranks of organisations.\nThe challenge I see when we think about all of these issues is what they tell us about the sustainability of organisations and the workplace and you just have to look outside of the workplace into the community to see issues around sustainability coming to the fore and our perspectives on environmentalism in particular changing. So I think sustainability in 2020 is going to be hot on the radar, just because Brexit is the ultimate test of sustainability for organisations.\nFinally generational differences, we talk a lot about millennials, we don't talk at all about senior parts of the workforce. I think we need to really focus on surfacing what it means for individuals working later in life and I think 2020 is going to be a conversation about later life working.\nNC: So David in some ways more of the same?\nDD'S: I think I'd agree with that around the millennials point. So I think if you look at the age band there you're talking about people who are up to 37, 38, I don't think it's going to be a surprise with the whole glut of them hitting the workforce. So I think we need to smash some of the preconceptions around millennials in the same way they smash their avocados apparently! I think there are some more straightforward issues which will be facing practitioners in the new year.\nSo we know that we have IR35 and the implications of that coming in. That will be a significant challenge for a number of organisations in the way that they view the composition of their workforce, in the way that they contract with people. I also think there's likely to be a slew of workplace legislation that comes in that's going to create some challenges for practitioners. So I think one of the things that we know is that we probably overestimate as a profession how much of the change will be driven by trends within the profession and we underestimate actually how much of it is caused by the external environment.\nAnd Josie mentioned the dreaded B word at the very start of this and one of the things we've seen is a huge degree of uncertainty and the challenges that's provided for organisations in terms of when and how they invest, particularly in people, that will continue into the next year and it will be interesting to see how that impacts on some of the opportunities people have for learning, how it impacts on the job market more broadly, and how it impacts in terms of access to labour. So I think there are some really broad themes but I also think there are some ones that just will impact practitioners day in, day out.\nNC: Okay. Let's pick up on that with Josie, I mean as we've already heard there from David the problems with Brexit have been hitting recruitment and talent planning, the availability of skilled migrant workers, job security, I mean I could go on with this list, in a way company managers and people professionals have got to be watching the news very carefully haven't they in many ways?\nJC: Yeah but I mean they're only human as well and I think all of us know just the level of uncertainty that watching the news actually creates and one day it's one thing and the next day it's something else. And David made the point that investment is actually basically impossible in this uncertain environment, or at least a long-term investment. And people budget, investing in skills, investing in talent, that's often the first thing to go or the first thing to be scaled back at least when there is such an uncertain environment. So that's something that also has an impact on morale, as a result of that unproductivity, on the way people motivate themselves to work. So I think on a very, very basic level that is one impact that Brexit is having. I was trying to figure out what the actual impact of a polarised work environment in terms of different political opinions was having on workplaces and whether anyone's actually measured that sort of impact.\nNC: So you're not talking here about managing people through this process you're talking about actually how people feel about what's happening in the world. And how they find they're working alongside people with a very different world view.\nJC: Yeah exactly. Completely. And if you have to collaborate closely on a daily basis with someone who you know is completely opposed to you politically, how do you actually manage that and how do you come to terms with that? And I didn't find any specific data on Britain during the Referendum or after the Referendum but I did find some data from the American Psychological Association, APA, from 2016, during the US Presidential campaign which of course was equally divisive and polarising and it was quite stark actually, it was a very, very large study of thousands of members of the workforce and about 17% of those admitted that as a result of political discussions they were being less productive at work; they were feeling more tense; they were feeling more stressed out; they felt like they weren't able to express themselves as freely as they otherwise would have. So I think that is something we can probably extrapolate to the UK and it's quite worrying.\nNC: And what about managing people who are feeling these issues? In many ways there are opportunities, I guess we perhaps even saw this last year or the year before managers making mistakes because they're caught in the headlights, they want to try and solve problems that they can't?\nEH: Yes we're in a very kind of odd situation compared to what we feel. Pay is increasing at a greater rate around 3.64%, it's not been that high for a very long time, so pay increases are going well. We have very low unemployment. Most job creation that's being created in the economy is in high skilled labour not low skilled labour. So when you look at the economic indicators it's actually quite a rosy picture. However when you go into organisations and speak to individuals the reality for them is actually quite a lot of uncertainty.\nSo the practices that HR professionals, or people professionals need to build into their work are around voice, so it's about incorporating voice activity, listening and sharing and communicating with employees. So not just conducting surveys but actually bringing voices of individuals together in communities and groups within the organisation, actually talking as line managers and supporting individual workers, in particular EU nationals who may have some uncertainty. So we have the EU Settlement Scheme which is actually very positive, and it probably has settled quite a lot of concerns but there will still be some concerns for individual employees, particularly from the EU.\nUK nationals, I think the challenge is going to be that long-term potential. So where do they see themselves going? And I think what's happening is Brexit is making us very short-term and we need organisations and managers to be thinking long-term and that's a very difficult thing to do in this environment where we feel very unsettled as individuals.\nNC: That clearly makes perfect sense but I just wonder about the reality. For most people the HR function is pretty remote to them, how do you provide this support? Give us some practical tips as to how you, not only track, as we've heard, but then try and keep people on board?\nDD's: Well I think the first step is not to be a remote HR function. So I think it is about that connection and understanding in the organisation. There are different ways you can do that in terms of gathering different data points but also honest conversations with people and opening them up more broadly. So I always say good HR people have good antennae, they know what's going on in the organisation and they can feel it. <<P>I think to pick up on Ed's point there is an overriding sense of uncertainty and actually sometimes it's about how people feel about the external environment rather than what is actually going on. For the last decade or so probably the kind of business guidance has been to talk about agility, to talk about change, to talk about how profoundly different things are going to be and I think there's a good argument to be made that actually providing people with stability in these environments and things that they can feel comfortable with, whilst also being transparent around some of the change, will actually help connect employers and employees in a different way.\nSo what you need is essentially that two-way voice where I can say, 'actually I'm concerned about this,' or, 'I'm not feeling positive about it,' or 'Actually it's impacting my mental wellbeing,' and the organisation is responding to that, not just with an organisational drive for change, and we need to be better and we need to be agile, but actually the organisation's listening to that and going, 'Right this is how we're going to solve it together. This is some of the stuff we can be stable on. This is some of the stuff that will be staying the same. This is some of the stuff that's going to be up for grabs, but we'll work with you to work out how that change happens.'\nJC: I think David made a really good point there, if I can interrupt quickly on just the fact that HR should no longer be seen or should never have been seen as this sort of appendage to the larger organisation, this sort of administrative function that sits somewhere upstairs in the corner. And I think people are slowly realising that actually HR has a seat at the boardroom table, that it should have a constant dialogue with upper management, with CEO, with CFO, with CIO, whoever that might be. But I still feel like that's a big barrier to many organisations and I feel like a lot of organisations still think that these conversations around workplace balance, around wellness in the workplace, around mental wellbeing, should be the domain of the HR department, but that shouldn't be the case. So how do we get around that? How do we progress?\nEH: It's a really important point I think in that a lot of the discourse in an organisation, particularly at a time like now is about productivity and performance but not about wellbeing and individual wellbeing. That is the role of the people function. The role of the people function is to marry those two concepts to enable a productive and well-functioning and efficient organisation and to support individuals. And in a political environment, which is fractured, they will see the workplace as a place where they're in communities with people who may be very different in political view to them, so how do you build community as well as enable people to be healthy. And I think that is a really important role for the function.\nOne thing we can be certain about in 2020 is there will be another corporate governance scandal, something will go pear-shaped in an organisation, a very important organisation, in the UK and we will be picking up the pieces. And so the reason I think we need to talk about the senior leadership in HR moving into the senior echelons, is to protect against those governance scandals appearing in the future. And we have to be learning from our mistakes of the past. So as we've seen over the last few years we've seen more governance, governance regime becoming much more aware of these particular issues, taking much greater attention to culture of organisations, measuring culture, or attempting to measuring culture.\nNC: The second hot topic - diversity and inclusion. The gender pay gap that's been very much in the news, large organisations have found themselves in the headlines and you say this will continue to play out in this year.\nJC: Yes absolutely, especially because we haven't yet seen any significant progress towards creating perfectly balanced organisations and we certainly won't for a long time so rightly so the spotlight will continue to be on that. 2020 will bring the third round of reports on the gender pay gap which is, of course, one of the most obvious metrics of diversity and inclusion currently in the media headlines. Last year we didn't see too much progress on that front so it will be interesting to see whether we're at least moving in the right direction this year.\nBut I think also interesting other metrics beyond gender will start to move into the mainstream conversation. The last government had quite an exhaustive consultation on ethnicity pay gap reporting and the prospect of that coming in at some point. Obviously there are lots of challenges in this respect, reporting on ethnicity relies on people feeling comfortable, sharing more about their own identities, about their ethnicity, their backgrounds, how they consider themselves, which many organisations will perceive that as a real challenge. I'm doubtful whether we'll see any sort of concrete regulation coming in around ethnicity pay gap reporting in the near term but I do think that it will move more into the mainstream conversation.\nEH: I agree entirely that the conversation around D&I at the reporting end is going to continue. So the CIPD's research hidden figures looked at the way that we currently conceptualise these data points, and also, more importantly the narrative that we use to describe this data and we know from the previous rounds of gender pay gap reporting that organisations have struggled to even measure individual's gender in their systems because they don't have the appropriate technologies in place. When we get to ethnicity it's going to be even harder and it's going to be highly unlikely, because of levels of disclosure in organisations.\nWhat that does tell us unfortunately is that there's a conversation there about trust. Do individuals actually trust their organisation to capture and securely hold their data and use it in the appropriate way? And so the D&I conversation is also a conversation about trust. And it's a question about relationships of individuals in the workplace.\nNC: Is there sometimes tension with management who might not necessarily fully understand or want the people professionals to be spending time on this?\nDD'S: I think it's probably the opposite problem which is lazy management and leadership expecting HR to solve it. And I think to go back to our previous point where we were talking about the role of HR it can't be to solve all of these complex issues, it can be to help build some systemic solutions to them and to help leaders understand their role in it. But D&I doesn't get solved in a silo in HR because it's not a siloed HR problem. HR has an ethical responsibility to it and a professional responsibility to make a contribution but I think there's some really lazy thinking in this space and I think, as Josie said, the key is helping people get comfortable with it.\nBut I think actually part of the key is helping people feel more uncomfortable about how things stand, so whether it's the gender pay gap, whether we're talking about ethnicity, whether actually we're talking about just the treatment of people in work, if you want to have good work people need to feel comfortable in their surroundings, need to be paid fairly and transparently and there are a whole host of other factors that you want in play there. We're not in that situation currently and actually for us, given the amount of resources that we have as a modern nation, particularly in the UK, that's nothing short of disgraceful and I think we still use words about slow progress, actually it's reprehensible that we're in the situation that we're in and that day in, day out, people are undervalued societally and we've got a role to play in that but organisations more broadly have an obligation to solve that.\nNC: Because it's all about corporate culture isn't it? And I guess when things are broken on the inside they get revealed on the outside. I was intrigued the other day to see Trevor Philips who's founding chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission who now chairs Green Park, a recruitment company, he said, 'People of colour seem to be superglued to the floor.' He was talking there about the diversity of FTSE boards, but what do you think he really meant by that?\nEH: That's an interesting way of describing what is essentially systemic oppression of people not being able to move through, or progress in organisations, so superglued to the floor is an interesting way of saying it but what we need to do is move beyond a conversation about race at the upper echelons of organisations and actually put in place practices that work, that support individuals to progress and that we see senior leaders being good allies around race. So we see people allying to support others in their organisations to progress, no matter what their background, no matter what their sexual orientation or gender identity etc. We need a conversation that includes progress through activity and action.\nThe issue with gender pay gap reporting is that a lot of it is about words on a form and what we need is much better action plans to change practices in organisation.\nNC: So Josie do you want to round up because we've talked about a lot of different aspects of this?\nJC: One point I was just going to add to what Ed was saying was that I completely agree I think that's absolutely right. And I think we have to start thinking about how we can get the ear of the upper echelons of management and unfortunately the way it is we still live in, well I don't know if it's unfortunate or not, but shareholder primacy is still a reality, so the CEO, the top management is still going to be concerned about the bottom line of an organisation. So if we can start linking the discussion around DNI to the discussion around the bottom line, revenues, profits, then that is one way that I think we're going to get people to realise just how important it is to make it a core strategy of any organisation. So if we can create incentives, if we can do something like that, that would certainly help to centralise that priority and to get rid of those siloes that David was talking about because I think that's exactly it.\nWith gender pay gap reporting last year we saw that reams and reams of organisations waited until the very, very last minute to publish their figures which, to me, indicated that a lot of them were just thinking of it as an administrative tick box, something that rolls around once a year that they have to do. But we have to start changing the dialogue around that and making them realise that actually it is of real benefit to the organisation if they can get this right.\nEH: One thing just to say that they published, a number of organisations then took their numbers back and then they published again, took it back, published again, there's no way that we know the quality of the data that's on that system. So there's a long way to go before we can trust any of the data that's been published on gender pay gap reporting.\nNC: And lastly on Josie's list the younger members of the workforce, the millennials we talked about at the beginning. an increasingly important force, to be ignored at the employer's peril.\nDD'S: I'm not convinced. So I think there's a healthy disagreement between Josie and I on this. I think understanding how work needs to vary for individuals and understanding actually how flexible you can be I think that's a concept or a principle that extends across all parts of the workforce. I think there are too many consultancies selling too many reports and too much consultancy on the back of work around different generations. I'm not entirely sure it's helpful, I'd rather organisations and HR practitioners took a healthy look at their own organisation, its composition, but more importantly to Ed's point listen to people more actively about what they want, what they need in their role and help people have a voice to help build trust in organisations.\nNC: Your witness Josie.\nJC: Yeah I do actually agree with everything that David's saying but I do think that millennials have started a conversation that other generations have perhaps not started and perhaps that stems from the fact that these are the people who grew up on social media, they grew up in a world where they were accustomed to being able to make their voices heard on the internet, broadcast to thousands of people at their whim. So that is something that they expect in real life as well and I think what that's done is when they move into the workforce it's given them the confidence to make their voices heard, to voice their opinions, to be very vocal about the expectations that they have of their employer. And I think that that has created a bit of a challenge to the sort of traditional concepts of the working world that we've been accustomed to for hundreds of years. So they're creating that sort of momentum but I do agree I think it's something that isn't just important for millennials, it's important for every single generation and every demographic that is in the workforce.\nNC: And given that some of the problems facing companies at the moment some managers might argue you need to manage people's expectations, you can't pander to people, or maybe offer them some kind of hope that things will change when the organisation can't deliver those changes.\nEH: There's a reality of life that exists between an organisation and an individual and in the people profession we talk about this concept of employee experience, so there's not much evidence about what it actually means but what seems to be happening is organisations are crafting individual practices around different parts of the workforce. So I think that's the level at which organisations are moving. So instead of having a one size fits all approach, now organisations, through their practices, are considering what the needs are of individuals and that's particularly important to different workers of different generations, not just millennials, not just older workers, but there's more individualisation happening for individuals in the workforce and that's quite interesting because as consumers we want individualised products and services, it's now happening in the workplace.\nNC: So David let's try and sum all this up what kind of mindset do you think that smart people professionals will be adopting to deal with some of these things in 2020?\nDD'S: Oh it's all about mindsets these days isn't it? An agile mindset. No I think the key one is actually for too often I think it would be a fair criticism of HR and the people profession that there have been too many initiatives and not enough difference made. And I think it's about genuinely resolving to solve or make a difference or shift the dial, to use the kind of words that Josie did. Some things over the New Year, pick two or three things that you want to be fundamentally different in your organisation next year and list everything you would need to do to help that change happen. And we'll do this and we'll do that and we'll do that. And it becomes inevitable that at least one of those will be a success.\nEH: So I'm quite optimistic about 2020. I feel like 2020 is the year I hope that the world rights itself, and I mean that politically but I also mean it environmentally. We should have a conversation about environment and workplace. So that's going to be my hope for 2020. And I also hope when we start to think about all of these concepts in the round we become much more evidence-based as a profession. So I hope 2020 is the year where we really adopt evidence into our practices as a people function.\nJC: I hope that for 2020 organisations start to view individuals as humans, more so than they have in the past. I think that we'll see that in individualisation of workplace practices, of meeting demands and requirements of generations, regardless of whether that's the millennials or older workers.\nI think that if we don't get the diversity and inclusion equation correct then we might as well not bother with any of the rest of it because we need everyone, every member of a workforce to feel like they're being valued for who they are and for what they can offer and I think that is so basic and I'm very, very surprised that we're in 2020 now and we are still not quite getting that part right.\nNC: Well thank you then one and all, business journalist and commentator Josie Cox; Edward Houghton and David D'Souza from team CIPD.\nSo that's what 2020 may, or may not, have in store for us.

      "summary": "Critical thinking is a key skill for HR and all people professionals – it's the ability to think well and to reflect objectively on the ideas, opinions and arguments of others. It can help us solve complex problems and make better decisions, bringing clarity to confusion and increasing our potential to succeed when others look to us and our teams for answers that work.\nListen to Warren Howlett and Tim Coburn discussing why critical thinking is important, and how you can learn to reason well.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:21:35\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: In May we recorded a podcast about evidence-based decision making and how to recognise and understand all those factors that play into the choices and decisions we make at work every day. One of the central skills you need to do that is critical thinking and today we're going to dig into what it is and how you can learn to reason well and independently.\nWarren Howlett has been looking into this for the CIPD and here he is explaining why he thinks critical thinking is a key skill for HR.\nWarren Howlett: Critical thinking is the ability to think well and to critically reflect on the ideas, opinions and arguments of others. There are three key parts to critical thinking for people professionals. The first of those is critiquing the ideas, opinions and arguments of others. The second of those is how they construct arguments and opinions themselves that they are communicating to others. And the third piece is to identify when others are using critical thinking techniques that impact how that people professional is making a case or building an argument making a business case.\nAnd a really good example of that I think is, as a people professional, if we just think back, was there a time when you were in a meeting where you've done a lot of prep work, you've done your homework for a sound case for a people practice or an investment and you've gone into the room having already spoken to stakeholders beforehand, you've done all of that work, and yet when you're in the room somehow the business case didn't land and a lot of the conversation was spent talking about something else that was unrelated or perhaps that was someone in the room using their critical thinking skills to appeal to history, perhaps they were talking about something that didn't work in the past, that may even be unrelated. Perhaps it's a red herring and actually they're talking about things that are completely unrelated to the case that you're making that actually distract the conversation in the moment.\nAnd it's really important for people professionals to be able to identify when this would be happening in the room. After the meeting is far too late. We actually get a relatively small number of opportunities where we are in those types of situations, perhaps with the executive team that may only meet once a month, to actually make a case. So it's really important that people professionals are on a level playing field with many of the line leaders who will have gone on leadership development programmes, perhaps they've had legal training, and lawyers tend to be particularly good at aspects of critical thinking. And so it's really about people professionals actually being on a level playing field with those in the room, being able to reflect critically on the ideas, arguments and opinions of others to be able to make good, sound, logical cases themselves, and to identify when in the room somebody may be actually using critical thinking technique or perhaps we would call them common errors, common errors in critical thinking, to distract from the conversation that's being had in the room.\nPL: And if people listening to this and thinking yeah that's landing with me, I see exactly what he's talking about, how do they develop that critical thinking ability?\nWH: So I think there are some quick wins and some longer term development pieces. I think that constructing logical, sound arguments, takes some coaching and some practice. So it takes a bit of time to do. I think that identifying common errors is something that can be done quite quickly. Some of those are very obvious. So for example, personal attack. If you're under personal attack in a meeting where someone is questioning your credibility and whether you should actually be in the room, that's fairly obvious. But things like, as I mentioned, appeals to history, red herrings, whether someone is being selective in using evidence, these are all common errors of which there are 30 or so. And actually just being aware of what those common errors are, could be incredibly powerful for you as a people professional when you are going into conversations and looking for investments, helping to make decisions.\nPL: It's subtle isn't it? It's about learning to listen really carefully?\nWH: Absolutely. And I think identifying what you want to do as a response. I think that's actually probably the trickiest thing once you start to get the hang of it because you need to be able to really call out when this is actually happening in a room but without necessarily assuming someone's intent. So it could very well be the case that someone has the intent to derail the conversation, to stop or delay a decision around an investment or a case that you were trying to make, or to even manipulate the room, that's all possible. But it could also be very well that they just happen to be very good at critical thinking, they've perhaps had some training or development in the past and it's part of their DNA, it's part of their systems one thinking, they do it automatically and subconsciously without thinking.\nPL: It sits side by side, does it, with? We talked about evidence-based decision making in a recent podcast, it's in the same arena isn't it?\nWH: Absolutely, yes. That's a very good point. So the critical thinking aspect of our New Profession Map on which it is a focus area, is part of the analytics and creating value section in our core knowledge, and much of the evidence-based practice work also sits in that area and evidence-based practice is about asking good questions and that is a key aspect of critical thinking.\nPL: Tim Coburn has over 20 years' experience with the BBC, Motorola and Rolls Royce where he was Global Head of Talent and Global Head of L&D. That is where his interest in critical thinking began and now he's working with the CIPD to develop a course for members. So Tim thanks for joining us and I should say at this point we're recording this podcast in CIPD's offices in Victoria in Central London and it is a particularly noisy day here today so you can hear a bit of noises off but I think we'll crack on anyway. Tim shall we start with critical thinking - what is it? How would you define it?\nTim Coburn: Critical thinking is the ability to think well, to think clearly, to take into account a number of diverse considerations and to reach conclusions which engage and take other people with you. It has a particular relevance in today's world particularly because lots of the problems that we encounter are actually familiar to us and we can deal with those with our intuition. But there are some problems, perhaps more so these days, that require a bit more thought. They're more complex, they're unfamiliar and they need new ways of thinking.\nPL: What sort of things are you talking about?\nTC: The most obvious example is digital transformation, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, has actually displaced human capacity. A lot of our basic thinking can be done for us. This means that human beings actually are able, they have the capacity, to move to, if you like, a more intellectual higher ground where they can do some thinking that's required to address the more complex, perhaps value-based, concerns that we have in the world. And critical thinking I think has a particular part to play in helping us address those more complex issues.\nPL: That's interesting. So yes the more demanding decision making, the more collaborative decision making? Because there's more of that now as well isn't there?\nTC: Well there is and actually the history of critical thinking has tended to lead us to think that it's associated with individual ability, individual excellence. It's deeply embedded in the world of philosophy and in academia and in our educational system and we develop it as an, if you like, underpinning, transferable skill in our educational lives. But actually in today's world we now know that collective intelligence outperforms individual intelligence or IQ, particularly in problem solving issues. So what we are starting to find is that actually the problems that we encounter in today's world are better addressed in groups using collaborative and conversational intelligence more so than leaving it up to the expert to come up with the answer.\nPL: That's interesting. So obviously that's going to be most people's experience of work now, as you say lots of people in a room trying to solve something. I know that you've been interested in this for a long time, where did it start for you?\nTC: Well actually it started during my corporate career when I was Head of Learning at Rolls Royce and one of our HR directors, the most senior HR director in the company at the time, came to me and said, 'We deal, as an HR community with highly intelligent, some of the world's best engineers working on some of the world's leading aerospace technologies and sometimes, as HR business partners and directors and advisers, we need to get stuck into conversations with people who can be quite intimidating because of their intellectual ability. So for us as an HR community we need a way to engage in strategic conversations with our internal business partners. Can you come up with something that would help us? We think it might be in the area of critical thinking.' I hadn't heard that request before.\nPL: Fascinating yeah.\nTC: And this was around about 2006, 2007, so long before the contemporary interest in critical thinking has come to light. Anyway, so the request was from HR for some assistance to help them in collaboration with their business leaders and I came up with a way of helping them develop that ability.\nPL: And what was that?\nTC: It was a one-day workshop in critical thinking skills. And for me as a learning designer by background, I did my own subject matter research into what critical thinking is, translated it into an experiential learning workshop and the senior HR business partners, HR directors, took part in a workshop which equipped them with the skills that they wanted to be able to use in conversation with their clients.\nPL: That will be a familiar conundrum to a lot of people working in a lot of different sectors, this idea that you have to engage on a serious level with people who do work, you don't actually understand.\nTC: Exactly.\nPL: And don't really need to understand.\nTC: Exactly.\nPL: But you still need to engage with them to get things done. So how did that go down?\nTC: It went down very well. The feedback was extremely positive and to just build on your observation that it equips people to engage with experts when we don't have subject matter knowledge ourselves, but it helps us in two ways. It helps us both engage but it also helps us to facilitate their thinking. So one of the roles that HR is often drawn into is the facilitation of meetings, particularly when there are difficult complex or strategic issues to address and HR is often turned to as can you facilitate the meeting? And on the one hand you could do that by standing with a flipchart and using the pen and saying, 'What do you want me to write down?'\nBut we can be a lot more proactive than that and most HR practitioners are. And what we often do is come up with a structured process which helps the business leaders themselves do their thinking in a more robust, structured way and critical thinking adds value to that. So for example, just to go into critical thinking a little bit, it gives us broadly three things in my view. First of all it gives us a set of standards or principles, a set of quality criteria, by which we can judge both our thinking and the output of our thinking, the proposals, solutions or ideas that come from it. The second thing it gives us are a set of what are known as common errors. It sounds a little bit like jargon but actually these common errors have been around for many, many years and you'll probably find resources on the internet where there are up to 300 common errors.\nPL: What sort of things?\nTC: Well things like, the most simple of which would be what is known as hasty generalisation, which we all know as 'umping to conclusions' And we all have a tendency, based on prior experience or prior observation, that we think we know what to do in a certain situation, or what the answer should be.\nPL: You reach for the familiar?\nTC: Yeah and so we go for that and sometimes without questioning the assumptions or beliefs or inferences that are being made at the same time. So hasty generalisation is an example of a common error. So a more complex one would be one that's known as necessary and sufficient conditions. So we might be attending to an argument or a debate, development of a proposal, in which we start to think we've got a good solution that seems like one we could implement and would work, but actually it might only be fulfilling some but not all of the necessary conditions for it to succeed. And so if we went ahead with that we would be committing the error of necessary but not sufficient conditions.\nAnother example would be, and these will sound much more familiar especially in the world of work, they're known as the appeals generally as a category, and one that's often used in the world of work is appeal to history, which we would automatically recognise as oh that must mean something like we've always done it this way so that's how we should do it now. And we'll have heard a lot of that in organisations. Another is appeal to popularity. So consensus is right, right? okay? Well actually sometimes, no it isn't, because the people contributing to the consensus of opinion may not have access to all the knowledge that we should be bringing to bear to a particular situation.\nThe immediate question now becomes if your curiosity is enlightened by this you'd be saying, 'So what would it do for me to know about these common errors?' So what it would do is give you a set of lenses or ways of listening in to important business conversations. And being able to notice and pick out errors that are being made in the quality of conversation that was taking place. And it would equip you to ask questions that would bring to light the error and lead to a solution.\nPL: And the third point?\nTC: Yeah the third point is, once we're aware of the common errors and the principles or standards by which we judge the quality of our thinking, is the ability to hold conversations and be persuasive in discussion with colleagues. It's all very well having very good individual, independent thinking, but unless you're able to engage and persuade and take other people with you then your individual idea isn't going to add much value in a corporate setting. So corporate organisations, by definition, are collaborative. We get things done by working together. So if anybody has a good idea and want to persuade others critical thinking actually gives you the armoury of persuasion and one of the huge advantages to HR is that it actually reinforces the role and contribution that HR can make to the business agenda.\nPL: So going back to Rolls Royce where you first started playing with this concept, you came up with this course and people went on the course, presumably your HR partners were delighted with it. What about the people on the other side of the table? What about the expert people within the organisation? Did they see a difference in the quality of interactions?\nTC: Well of course this is the golden ticket question, and I want to say 'Yes of course!' but actually as we all know in the domain of behavioural change, it takes time.\nPL: Did they resist it?\nTC: Not at all. I think, and the feedback from colleagues was that they slowly experimented with asking a different set of questions or making a different set of suggestions in the discussions that they were taking part in and they felt more confident about being able to add value. They felt more competent in having a new skill, a different skill, and in fact some of the feedback that came after a few weeks and months was, you know what people are starting to say, 'Where did you get the ability to ask those questions from?'\nPL: That's pleasing.\nTC: So that was the kind of indicative feedback that in the world of learning and development we often treat with a bit more respect than the tick sheet at the end of the workshop, or indeed personal testimony. What we like is testimony from customers or colleagues who've engaged and noticed a change in behaviour. And that was the evidence that made me think, when I was working at Rolls Royce, that this actually was having an impact that really added value, particularly to HR people.\nPL: So that worked really well. Presumably you've put that into play in other organisations now?\nTC: Yes, so since that time I started to work as an independent consultant around about five years ago, and there are two or three areas of interest that I have pursued. And one of which is working with executive teams in which I'm often asked to design and facilitate meetings that will help senior leaders make strategic decisions and at the same time learn how to be better as a high performing team. And one of the methods or tools that I've introduced into that setting is critical thinking. So for example I was working with a financial services organisation and particularly with their IT leadership team and they were looking to introduce new technologies in their journey towards digital transformation. So the agenda for the two days was mostly about project planning and implementation but they had asked me to introduce new skills that they might also use to better effect, and critical thinking was one of those so I integrated the development of these new skills with the challenges that they were addressing. And to me this is the perfect way of enabling people to learn a new behaviour if you attach it to a real issue that they believe is absolutely relevant, top of their agenda.\nPL: So they're properly engaged with it.\nTC: And then equip them with skills they can use to address that challenge more effectively proves to be very, very compelling for participants. The kind of things I included in that were an introduction to the critical thinking standards or principles by which a good argument or a good proposal can be developed: an awareness of the common errors that can often be made and how to spot them and how to ask questions that challenge them. And the third dimension is to have conversations as a team using the principles of collective intelligence.\nNow I should say here, because the astute listener will be thinking how is collective intelligence part of critical thinking? Well, we all know that critical thinking began about 3,000 years ago with Socrates and the research into collective intelligence wasn't done at that time. But if we are going to teach or provide critical thinking in today's world, then we need to take account of the innovations in the way human beings think that have also happened in more recent years. And emotional intelligence, we wouldn't think in today's world of tackling a problem without being empathetic or compassionate or caring or being ethical. Our attunement to these principles comes from the great work in the domain of emotional intelligence. And we can attach that to critical thinking. In the same way we can attach the recent research into collective intelligence into critical thinking for today's world.\nPL: So it's becoming more complicated.\nTC: Well I think it is and I think the high ground, if I can call it that, for human beings is to accept that our behaviour is being disrupted by technology. In other words we don't need to do some of the things that technology can now do for us. It's taken away our need to do routine thinking but actually gives us capacity to do more complex, innovative thinking. And I think critical thinking is one of the key skills that HR practitioners and business leaders could equally be able to use in this area.\nPL: And here's Warren on how the CIPD can help you to develop this vital skill.\nWH: We have some free resources that will be available on our CIPD learning platform. So we're building that in parallel to the New Profession Map. So there will be an area of CIPD learning for analytics and creating value, and part of that will be on critical thinking. So that will be available as a resource for free to all of our members. And we are also building a short course around critical thinking which I am doing with Tim Coburn. And we are looking to pilot that in Q4 of this year.\nPL: Thanks to Tim and to Warren and while you wait for the new CIPD resources why not take a look at the Profession Map to see where critical thinking fits in. You'll find it on the CIPD site.\nNow after presenting over 150 monthly podcasts for the CIPD, I'm going to hand over the series to a new presenter in January. So listen out for a new voice and insightful conversations in 2020. The team will be taking a well-earned break in December. In the meantime my name is Philippa Lamb and on behalf of the series producers Lucy Greenwell and Becky Jacobs, and me, thanks for listening.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "Learning in-the-flow of work requires practitioners to design and facilitate learning close to the workface, and that requires new thinking and tactics. We can no longer rely on 'the course'. What does this mean for L&D practitioners? And what has been the impact of technology and digitalisation?\nIn this episode, Andy Lancaster (Head of Learning, CIPD), David James (Chief Learning Officer, Looop Learning) and Kate Graham (Head of Content, Fosway Group) discuss what is meant by 'learning in-the-flow of work', how it differs from performance support, what it means for L&D practitioners, organisations and those who work in them, and why it is important to provide. We also look at what L&D professionals can do to ensure they deliver effective learning in-the-flow of work and the importance of evidence, data and context.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:27:12\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: If you keep track of new trends in learning and development, you'll already know that the field is learning from entertainment providers like Netflix and Spotify. Content is curated into a series of playlists or channels, you subscribe, and that content is recommended to you depending on your job role, algorithmic recommendations or just the sort of content you consumed before. And like the entertainment streaming services those recommendations are getting more sophisticated. But corporate learning isn't about entertainment. We watch it to learn, and Josh Bersin, the internationally renowned HR industry analyst, thinks we're now entering a new era which he calls 'Learning in the flow of work'.\nWith me to talk about what that is and how it works, I have Andy Lancaster, Head of Learning here at the CIPD and David James, Chief Learning Officer at Looop. Hello to you both.\nDavid James: Hi.\nAndy Lancaster: Hello.\nPL: Okay well shall we kick off by actually talking about what learning in the flow of work actually means. David.\nDavid James: Learning in the flow of work is best described from the end user perspective. I always do a compare and contrast because it's very easy to get caught up in the nuts and bolts of what it should look like if we start with content and programmes. So imagine that you are a front end user. Ideally you're new to a role, to an organisation, so it's when your eyes and minds are wide open to the challenges and unfamiliar situations that you may face. But then you are alerted to useful stuff that meets the needs that you have in that unfamiliar situation, guides and supports you to action at the other end. Now that is at a very high level and the reason I like to start there is that we sometimes lack the vision to imagine the ideal situation rather than look at our existing platforms and programmes and think 'how could we use those'?\nPL: So on the ground, what does it look like? Am I understanding this right? It interleaves tips and ways of working into the places, the systems, you're already going to do your day job, places like Slack or G Sweep?\nDJ: Ideally it will be integrated into the tools you use for work. I'm not a big fan of creating facilities, whether that be universities or academies for learning when people's primary motivation at work is to do the job better and faster, and to improve their prospects for a myriad of different reasons, but it's about them, their role and their career, not necessarily just about the learning. So if we can integrate with the tools they are already using for work I think, Josh Bersin mentioned previously that it's about being where workers are or where learners are, then we can influence what they do when it's important to them.\nPL: And that sounds like good sense Andy?\nAndy Lancaster: It is. We go to work to deliver something on behalf of our organisation, whatever sector we might work in, it's actually about delivery. So for me learning in the flow of work is naturally occurring learning. This has been happening for years, it's happening all the time and I think to one extent HR and L&D are just waking up to the fact that this is going on, but there's a skill to harness and amplify this. So yeah I think this is really exciting and because it's happening already. this is doable. We've just got to get our heads around a change of mindset to support and amplify what's taking place already.\nPL: And what sounds appealing to me is it builds on the way we all source our entertainment doesn't it, so it's not like we're having to learn a whole new way of doing this and that's got to be a big plus point?\nAL: I think it is, and we're naturally accessing content and solutions and we can all think of ways through technology or peers or contacts where we derive solutions to the challenges and the opportunities we have. So I think again we're not having to equip learners for this they know to do this stuff. What we're having to think about is, within organisations how we can facilitate this? So for me one of the big shifts is we're moving away from the concept of going on a course, to actually having a solution which is there in the workplace. And that's a massive shift for L&D professionals. Most of us come from backgrounds where most of our time has been around designing and delivering courses where you have to wait weeks sometimes to access something relevant. So this is a timely shift to solutions where when I need them in the moment something is provided for me to be able to learn.\nPL: And even when you don't know you need it, it's certainly a little tip to make things better for you.\nAL: Well exactly and often it's in the moment that I suddenly realise I do need something.\nPL: Yeah so it's prompting you.\nAL: It is prompting and that's a huge mindset shift for learning professionals to be thinking about solutions and not courses.\nPL: So David tell me about on the ground companies doing this?\nDJ: So the best example that I'm aware of is Sky. Sky have been working this way for about three years. They have completely pivoted their approach but it doesn't mean necessarily that anybody wanting to dip their toe in needs to throw the baby out with the bathwater. But they're in a position now where they don't run training courses and they don't have eLearning for anything other than compliance. But they support their people, at the moment of need. They use first of all data to recognise that there is a real problem because one of the real challenges for learning and development for a long time has been engagement in the offering whether that be hits on the LMS or whether that be attendance on programmes. But if you are supporting people with what they need, when they need it, in service of what they're trying to do, what you realise is engagement is the least of your worries.\nPL: Because they don't need to choose?\nDJ: Yeah they're not choosing and then it's not about learning in the flow of work for them, it's about performing in the flow of work. So, to throw another phrase in, I think that what we are talking about here is L&D at the point of work because, to your point earlier Andy, people learn anyway, when they're faced with unfamiliar situations and challenges for the very first time they will be sourcing information from colleagues, they might be Googling to try to find some expertise or something that may be remiss of the organisation's context but still useful, and they're looking to apply that immediately into the flow of work. Now they're already doing that, so what's the role of L&D at the point of work because there are still challenges that stem from 'how do we do the right things around here in order to get results'?\nAL: David, you've made such a vital point there around data because often as L&D professionals I have to confess going back through my career I've done learning needs analysis which have come up with suggested needs which actually are not really aligned to the business priority, and I think David's point is absolutely well made - that data is crucial and to that extent L&D is shifting more towards a performance consulting approach where we begin to understand what are the key needs that are cropping up? And for that data is crucial because our systems provide us with the kind of things that people are requiring. But to that end, and I'm sure we'll come back to this in a moment Philippa, to that end the line manager is so crucial, that we have this close relationship that we can begin to understand exactly what people need in order to deliver and perform their jobs brilliantly.\nPL: I mean that's the key here because it's such a lovely idea, you can get carried away with the delivery mechanism but the content, it's all about the content isn't it being right, otherwise it's a complete waste of time.\nDJ: The content is in service of the problem so if we understand what it is that needs to be addressed and, yes, line managers can service performance requirements, but if we then search for the data that validates that - first of all that says, yes that's a real problem, and then speak with the actual end-users themselves and talk about what is it that they are trying to do in relation to that data? What is a critical point of failure? What do they care about as they're trying to do their work that they're not able to do efficiently or easily? Once we've got that understanding, and that's data and evidence, then I think we get into content. But it's about developing the right content in order to meet the needs and then working in an agile sense, with a capital A in order to move the needle and affect the data. But the data is the canary here because without data, then we are making big bets and assumptions that have rarely been validated. But with data we're saying there is a real problem and then people are going to care.\nPL: So this is back to evidence-based which we covered in a podcast not so long ago actually, this whole idea that you don't just work on what you think you know, you actually demonstrate it before you put the budget in. And presumably the content that's tweaking all the time, that's evolving all the time in response to how well it's working?\nAL: Well it has to be and I think this is why the relationship with L&D being closer to the business, and learning being closer to the business, is so crucial and, again, David makes a great point around this agile approach - if we're going to support learning in the flow of work, in the workplace, we need to get solutions there quickly so that people are not waiting, but then the feedback is so crucial that the learners themselves are giving great feedback about what they need and what we need to do to support that. So there's a close link between performance, support and learning. Those are different things. But in many situations people are looking for support in the moment and that's where the learning team agility is really important, that we are able quickly to iterate solutions and supply something that's really important. So I think for learning teams being very close to the business is crucial and often we've been in our ghetto, we've been in a learning or an HR ghetto, we've been part of the learning HR system and now we're...\nPL: This is a hobby horse of yours, isn't it? We talked about it before.\nAL: Well it is, Philippa, and I think what we're looking at, and I don't want to just throw another trendy word in here, but this is about a learning ecosystem where together we're working with managers, with staff, right across the business to create solutions which just touch those needs. The closer we get to the business, the better this becomes and that's a real challenge in speaking on a podcast such as this to us as HR and L&D professionals that we have to get out there and get very close to the business to understand what folks need.\nPL: And it's about the mindset of the entire business isn't it? It's not just about the L&D, it's not just about people learning. You become that learning organisation don't you?\nDJ: Yeah that's right it's when learning is absolutely integral to performance and it's not just via rhetoric in which you're creating a learning organisation in order to drive traffic towards programmes and content, it's creating a learning organisation that is focused on guiding and supporting people to do the right things at the right time, learning from their actions. And once you've got that base level of sophistication and competence and confidence, you can grow from there.\nI always use the examples of induction and new manager training, two things that organisations are always trying to improve or overhaul because induction is usually too much content in too short a space of time and then people are left to figure out the rest themselves. Whilst new managers aren't provided with any guidance or support for sometimes weeks, months or years after they've already made that difficult transition. With both of those situations, imagine guiding and supporting people to do the right things, to get results from day one, to build up their confidence and competence and for L&D's case build credibility and trust with the learning and development function because they too are focused on what the individual's trying to do.\nPL: So it's a bit like having an experienced colleague sitting at your shoulder all the time isn't it, just assisting you if you need it?\nAL: Yeah and organisations have always had those. I can think back through my career to the 'go to' person, you knew who those people were. And I think part of our role now as learning professionals is to harness that. But I think with that comes empowerment of learners which is really crucial. This is not about learning practitioners being the centre of the universe, the learner is the centre of this universe. And we need to empower them through all manner of things, that can be technology, we need to look at how we can leverage the technologies that people have. And you mentioned the 'go to' person, this is about communities of practice coming alive with those kind of contacts in the business.\nAnd we're looking at the emergence of things like augmented reality. I think that's one of the most crucial things that we're going to have now, where using AR we can actually put solutions right into the workplace, accessible, in the workplace, those kind of solutions naturally occurring.\nSo I think if we can empower learners to take greater interest, control in their learning then this just becomes a new culture in the organisation rather than I go on a course and I haven't done any learning unless I've been on a course, to actually I am owning my own learning and empowered to make this happen.\nPL: Can we talk a bit about different sorts of learners because we hear a lot about millennials and how it's different for millennials and obviously we're talking here about learning throughout organisations, all sorts of people. Works for everyone?\nAL: We love to stereotype, it's such a natural thing to do, but I think what we're seeing is this is about prevailing culture. So the younger people coming into the workplace, let's not brand them as millennials or Gen X, Y, Z or whatever that is, let's look at the prevailing culture. My Mum, bless her, at 84 now uses technology to track my flights when I travel.\nPL: There you go.\nAL: There you go, Mums will always be Mums. But it's about all age groups embracing technology, so I think at CIPD we're very reticent to stereotype that, this is not the way we should be going but we should maybe be looking at the way younger generations are leveraging technology in their lives as the prevailing culture and trying to replicate that within our organisations. So yeah let's not look at labels, let's look at prevailing cultures and see how we can leverage them.\nDJ: Can I just add one more thing here, I think that sometimes millennials and those coming through maybe tarred with a brush because it's seen that they have less patience for traditional learning and development methods. But I think that it's more about there is an intolerance for having to wait for the stuff that they find valuable. So whether that is something as intuitive or predictable as a web search, whether that is waiting for attendance on a programme for which that's when they get their formal development, I think there is an intolerance because the expectation now is that you can get what you need when you need it in order to perform and move on, and I think that's what we're facing and the resistance might actually be from L&D professionals who aren't willing to adapt their approach.\nPL: Yeah, that impatience and that's society-wide isn't it because we are all learning to expect instant gratification? We need to wrap this up but I just want to go back and you talked about Sky, obviously Sky - giant budgets, huge company, it's great they're doing this. But thinking about L&D and HR practitioners on the ground in rather smaller organisations, what sort of steps can they take towards this, because this isn't a thing where you have to step off a cliff is it, you can work towards it?\nDJ: The ethos behind this is experimentation because you have to be working towards affecting data and affecting performance, that can't come top-down in an organisation where it's a system implementation or programme rollout upon the, either assumed or aggregated, needs of an entire population. This is understanding what individuals are trying to do in relation to data, so that validation part, and then using an approach, learning in the flow of work, in order to move the needle and experiment with folks. Then you can scale with the right technology and then you can go on and automate to make a new smart in that regard.\nBut what I will say is this whole approach, technology is the cherry on the top of the cake, it's not the cake. The cake itself is working with and understanding real business problems, looking to move the needle with experimentation to understand what it is that people are trying to do, and what they're not able to do either at all or efficiently, and then you'll find the right tools in order to affect what it is they are trying to do. And it's never the other way round. And that's why I always say start with the end-user because that's where it's going to end as well and if you're just looking for problems to solve with your existing tools and content, it's highly unlikely that you're going to be trying affect learning in the flow of work.\nAL: The CIPD gave me a little bit of time to look at this because it is so crucial and here's just some areas where I think practitioners can get some really quick wins around this. One is looking at the whole thing about communities of practice and that's that 'go to' person. So the whole thing that facilitates communities is really important. Coaching is important because we've been doing this for ages but now we recognise coaching in the flow of work is really important. Valuing mistakes is really important and we often learn some of our biggest lessons through mistakes. And if we want to support self-direction in learning, things like curation are really important, and as David said digital.\nSo I suppose I could be cheeky here, you know. It's in the new book I'm writing around driving performance through learning. But there are practical things that we need to do and I think between David and I, there are some great things that people can take way. So I'd really want to encourage learning professionals - this is very doable but just think about the tools you have which can place learning right in that workflow to enable people to be empowered just to grab learning when they need to.\nPL: Great discussion thank you very much guys.\nWe talked about the role of tech in all this and Kate Graham is Head of Content at HR industry analysts Fosway Group and she is an expert in this area.\nI mean learning in the flow of work as an idea isn't new is it, but the way it's being done, the how, is new because it's all about tech isn't it?\nKate Graham: That's an interesting question because I'm not sure that it is necessarily about technology, I think that learning is becoming more digitally led so over the years since the click next eLearning revolution, we've seen organisations have realised this is a good way to scale. Technology is an easy way to scale, much easier than the classroom, so that's been the driver for it previously. But actually if you look at the drivers that Fosway is finding in our research now, it's things like drivers for digital learning include things like increasing availability, increasing agility and speed of learning, increasing learner engagement. So these things all make sense and ultimately it's about helping people find the right answer, in the right place, at the right time.\nPL: So tech is an enabler, not the starting point.\nKG: That is exactly the way that I would phrase it, yes.\nPL: There is, I think it's fair to say, quite a lot of dissatisfaction with existing L&D tech isn't there?\nKG: The dissatisfaction is definitely there and there has been a lot of this it looks good on paper, whether or not it's actually the right fit. At Fosway we always talk about context and often people will look at things like our nine grids and go, 'Oh someone's in the top right-hand corner, that must mean that they're really good,' but actually what's the context of your organisation, how do your people work, where did they work, how did they learn? You know they might need something completely different. So something like a smaller, cheaper social learning platform for example might be more appropriate than a full blown learning management system. So sometimes it's not the system's fault it's the way that it's been implemented.\nPL: Give me an example of what you mean by that, how it actually might work on the ground in a smallish organisation? What sort of systems might they use?\nKG: In some of these full suite applications there will be modules for talent acquisition, performance, succession planning, things like that, which obviously in a large organisation, enterprise organisation, are invaluable and are often still overlooked actually in their importance. But in a smaller organisation it might just be that you need to disseminate information, you might not be very hierarchical, you might not need to worry so much about succession planning in such a formal way, but actually people still need to learn and they still need to be able to hear new ideas and understand. It might be new products or it might be a new piece of software that they've got to use, you still need to disseminate that information. But something smaller like one of these learning experience platforms that we're seeing coming through now or you might hear them called social learning platforms. So these smaller, more nimble solutions don't have a lot of these additional bells and whistles that organisations that are smaller maybe don't need, so for their context actually it's about the right fit for them.\nNow a lot of people watched Love Island in the summer and a colleague of mine, Gemma Critchley, who works for Aviva in learning technology, she's amazing, she coined this phrase earlier in the summer about a system being their type on paper. And it ticked all the boxes that were on their procurement questionnaire etc. but the chemistry wasn't there. And it didn't fit.\nPL: What about devices, because people don't have to be using their company PCs for this do they?\nKG: No. We've just been looking at a piece of research that was done externally and it's fascinating actually because a lot of assumptions are made about 'bring your own device'. I think it's quite an obvious, easy win in some respects because people might go, 'Well we can't afford to give everybody a mobile or a tablet so we'll just get them to use their own.' But actually there are implications around storage, not everybody has the storage for these apps. How easy are they to set up? What other data does it give the organisation access to? Are there privacy issues?\nPL: Yes, security and privacy.\nKG: People are very private about how they use their phones and that's absolutely fine. And then about the types of content that you're expecting people to engage with. So just spending the money to shrink down a 30 minute eLearning course onto a mobile device, is anybody really going to sit there for 30 minutes on their phone and do that? Maybe if they get stuck on a train, like I did this morning, but most people are just going to use that for maybe quick reference, more performance support things. So as well as thinking about the device itself, it's also the type of materials and content that you are putting on there because you have to be realistic about people's usage patterns and what you can expect them to do on their own data, potentially in their own time.\nPL: Looking at the nuts and bolts, we talked about how you do this, should you be doing this? Evidence for working in this way actually does raise productivity, that it does bring wins for the organisation, does it exist this evidence now?\nKG: It's murky to be honest. Our Fosway research shows that less than a third of organisations are supporting learners' application of learning when they get back to the workplace. Less than a third are looking to sustain learning in the workplace and actually only 26% are adopting multi-channel delivery, so the devices piece that we just talked about. The data basically shows just that a lot of organisations are abandoning learners actually when they need to be nurtured and helped the most.\nPL: Isn't that interesting, so they spend the money, they introduce the system and then they let it fail. Is that quite a hill for L&D to climb and for management to climb, this idea that you don't get to the point where you can say, 'Well we did that and it produced this outcome' because it is continuous and so you're perpetually monitoring and perpetually evolving presumably?\nKG: There is definitely a mind shift for L&D here. But, by sitting back and going, well where are my organisation's pain points? Moments of friction can occur at any point in a day and a really obvious one is something that Asos encountered. Now Asos is a fashion brand and very cool. I've been to the Asos headquarters I felt very old and very drab.\nPL: I'm not going to ask you what you wore I bet that was a whole conversation.\nKG: Whatever it was it wasn't cool enough, let me tell you. And one of their main points of friction is actually in the kind of pre-boarding process because people are freaking out about what to wear on day one.\nPL: Really, that's the issue?\nKG: And it's so obvious, when you think about it. It's like of course people would be stressed about that. Now that is a moment of friction and they identified that after talking to groups, card raisers, new starters, and so actually what they built into their pre-boarding process is some tips and advice on what to wear on day one. And even just the fact that it's been addressed in terms of probably don't worry about it, I don't know exactly what they said, but as I say it's just such an obvious point.\nAnd then you can carry that through the first day. People aren't worried about the values of an organisation on their first day, where do I get my lunch, how do I get paid, all these basic things. And then when you get into that mindset you can go through almost people's journey through an organisation, how do I get promoted, how do I go through my performance review process, how does that work? Well if you proactively build in some resources that people can check and access themselves, so in the flow of work as we've been talking about, then suddenly they can put their mind at rest, or they at least know that there's maybe a champion or a manager or somebody that they can go and talk to about this stuff, but there's something there that has been thought of ahead of time. So it's trying to reduce that friction.\nPL: So despite the fact that as you say the evidence that this is a useful thing to do is pretty murky and insubstantial right now. You're confident that it is when it's done in the right way and supported continuously. That it does produce good outcomes?\nKG: Yes we do see, you know there are some great case studies emerging so as I say Sky is one of those that we've written about in our innovation profile series but when only 18% of L&D effort is actually going on impacting performance, you realise that we have a way to come and as I say at Fosway we talk about this habit of delivery, so it is getting into a different mindset. And you could argue education in general, I have a child who's just started Year One at school, you could argue that there's a lot of Victorian mindset that still exists, sitting at a desk, involves learning, what's learning? Actually is it just acquiring knowledge? The forgetting curve kicks in, what's the point? I can't recite my periodic table anymore, unsurprisingly! But it is definitely I think there are some great thinkers out there, a lot of people talking about experience and things like that and these things have a trickle-down effect. But ultimately it's about outcomes - how can you go to your business and say, 'I can help impact positively something that is part of an overall business goal,' because ultimately organisations are most concerned with performance, profitability, productivity. So how can learning help impact those?\nPL: Thanks to Andy Lancaster, David James and Kate Graham.

      "summary": "Neurodiversity refers to the fact that all our brains function differently. In the workplace it’s an essential area of diversity and inclusion that refers to alternative thinking styles, including autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia. Without an appreciation of neurodiverse conditions and considering how individuals can be enabled to perform at their best at work, employers will miss out on the sought-after skills of a large talent pool and potentially neglect a significant proportion of their customer base.\nIn this episode, Margaret Malpas, Vice President of the British Dyslexia Association, and the CIPD’s Diversity and Inclusion Adviser, Dr Jill Miller, explain why it’s so important for employers to understand neurodiversity. They also share ideas on how to create a neurodiversity-friendly workplace where people with alternative thinking styles can thrive. Kirsty Wilson, Lead International Job Coach at Auticon, an IT consultancy that exclusively hires adults on the autism spectrum, gives insights and practical examples of how to create an inclusive environment where people can fully use their talents.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:24:56\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: Hello and welcome to the podcast. Today we're talking about neurodiversity and neurodivergence. What exactly are they and why is neurodiversity something all organisations should be working to achieve? I have three experts in the field with me: Dr Jill Miller, Public Policy Adviser Diversity and Inclusion here at the CIPD; Kirsty Wilson, Lead International Job Coach at Auticon and Margaret Malpas, Vice President of the British Dyslexia Association. Thanks for coming in everyone.\nShall we kick off with the obvious question. What is neurodiversity? Kirsty.\nKirsty Wilson: So neurodiversity is the spectrum that human beings think differently. But within that umbrella of neurodiversity there are a lot of conditions that we know about like autism, ADD, ADHD, and within those conditions there are more prominent traits of alternative thinking.\nPL: Okay. So this plays into how people think, communicate, organise themselves, everything?\nKW: Everything. The way that they think, the way they approach problems, the way they approach their everyday life and routines, their social skills and a lot of the things that someone that doesn't have one of these conditions just take completely for granted; for someone that's got one of those conditions, it would be a little bit more challenging.\nPL: So in terms of the workplace, why then is it vital for employers to understand and appreciate it?\nMargaret Malpas: Because if you do not understand the people that are working for you, how can you possibly get the best out of them? There have been many, many billions of pounds spent on management development training which is completely redundant if we actually don't understand the people who are working for us. So it's crucial.\nPL: Jill?\nJill Miller: I think when we talk about neurodiversity, people are literally thinking differently, so why would you not want a range of perspective and ideas. But I think what happens in the workplace often is that we're not really embracing neurodiversity and that's something that we really want to encourage employers to do.\nPL: Shall we talk a bit about language and labels because functional labels can be very tricky?\nMM: I think there are two issues about labels. I think the first is that they are very often useful to an individual who has struggled with not understanding why they think the way they do, why they act the way they do.\nPL: Okay.\nMM: On the other hand, it is fairly critical that that label is accurate because that will often lead to the solutions, to coping strategies for them. So obviously if we get the label wrong then they may not necessarily get the help they need.\nPL: But I guess there's a danger in negativity isn't there because we talk about these things in terms of disorders.\nMM: Yes. I personally obviously do not like that particular terminology but it used to be used. And I think it's very often produced when people have conditions that have medical treatments. But we're not talking about medical treatments in the main with these conditions, we're talking about people who just process information differently and so it's much more helpful to think about 'difference' than 'conditions'.\nPL: Okay. Well since this field, I think, will be new to everyone, can we clear up some of the terminology?\nKW: I was going to say even within the communities I think labels is quite a controversial topic, and I mean the communities of those people that have a condition. So for autism for example, some people would say that it's a disability because they are so challenged by their condition, but others would see it as a strength and it's not a disability in any way whatsoever, it's a condition. And finding the right terminology even within that community, they don't agree either. So it's very important I think if you're speaking to someone and engaging with someone that has a condition, you know how they like to call it so you're not causing offence and you get to understand them and their approaches too.\nPL: Yeah, because for HR professionals this is difficult territory, isn't it. They don't want to offend but they do want to understand. So I'm wondering could we go through some of the... I've done a bit of research on this and come up with a string of words including things like 'neurodivergent'. Shall we start with that one, what exactly does that mean?\nMM: It means that you diverge from what we consider to be the neurotypical way of thinking, it just means there is a divergence, it's a change.\nPL: So the general run of people might be 'neurotypicals'? Would that be a word we'd use?\nKW: At Auticon we tend to not even use the word neurotypical because that then denotes there is a typical, there is a norm, there is a normal. And we hire people that are autistic so if we use the word neurotypical we're basically saying to them, everyone that's working with us that isn't autistic is normal, and maybe you're not, which is absolutely not the case. And when you're thinking about the concept of neurodiversity being each individual person, whether they have a condition or not, thinks differently, that word doesn't really make sense. So there isn't a catch-all phrase I don't think that's fair.\nPL: Kirsty, you obviously have a lot of experience in this area. Do you want to tell us a bit about your organisation?\nKW: Sure, so Auticon is an IT consultancy first and foremost, but our expertise is that we only hire IT consultants that are autistic. So when they apply for us we just have three criteria: that they do have an autism diagnosis; they have a STEM degree because they'll be working in IT; and they have at least one year's work experience, but that one year's work experience doesn't even have to be within IT. And we hire them and we pay them a full-time salary and then we place them into IT projects and tech projects for really large banks, large medical organisations, through to SMEs. And then they work within that client organisation doing an IT project, using their skills, using their strengths and capabilities, and they have support to help them in the workplace and navigate that traditional workplace at the same time.\nPL: So that raises a whole load of issues I want to talk about and I think the first one is management because there are some differences there and some things to know. So I'm presuming, Jill, this is an area where we've seen problems?\nJM: I think where problems can start is really a lack of awareness or understanding about neurodiversity to start with and I think it's really important, especially with line managers and other people who are recruiting into an organisation to start with, to give people some training, some basic understanding. And that's, I suppose, primarily and foremost so that we're not screening out really talented people who are coming for a job at our organisation who may have the skills and capabilities that we really want, but for some reason in the hiring process they're not making it through to a job role.\nKW: Maybe even before that as well and we speak to organisations about if you've put on a job spec that you need five years' experience, for someone that's autistic, they might have four and a half years and they're incredible, but they won't apply. So you don't even see that talent but then you're in an interview process speaking to someone with three years that can just persuade you really well that they can do the job.\nJM: Yes, so I think that's a really good point because I think job descriptions just of what people read about the job to start with is so critical. Often I think the tendency is to write a really long wish list of wanting to recruit a generalist who could be good at everything, in which case if somebody with a deep level expertise that we really want reads that they might screen themselves out because they can't tick every box. So one of the recommendations that we would make was can you really think carefully about a job description? What are the core skills there? And even separate it into things like we must have, those skills you must have and those skills that are nice to have.\nPL: And what about interviewing?\nJM: I think interviews can traditionally be a test of how quickly you can recall things and also of social interaction. And I think when we're thinking about any kind of screening or recruitment processes, people who are hiring need to be aware of neurodiversity to be able to take a moment of pause and reconsider their perhaps own preconceptions or consider what's necessary for the role. The example I'll give here is if somebody maybe finds it difficult to keep eye contact, to ensure that if they have got the skills required that they're not screened out for something that might be completely irrelevant to the job role.\nMM: One of the things that we find with dyslexia is that people think it's an issue to do with spelling and reading and it's not. Many, many dyslexics have problems with working memory and when you're in a stressed situation, which interviews are, then very often individuals' coping strategies go kaput. So one of the things we encourage is to make sure that questions are asked in the same order that people are given them, perhaps an hour in advance and so on. And it is interesting for employers because there's case law here over this. So in fact if employers don't abide with this kind of thing, they are actually breaking the law and I think many of them just don't realise this, and they're not trying to be difficult but they're just unaware of it.\nKW: I think the point you made there - of giving the questions in advance. I would say more than one hour even. But there's a tendency to assume that if you give them the questions in advance then they can plan too much and you won't really be able to find out how well they are at doing the job.\nPL: So unfair advantage?\nKW: Yeah exactly, but really that isn't the case because ultimately you should be able to have a conversation with someone to learn more about their experiences and how they can apply that to the job, not to catch them out in something.\nMM: And of course interviews are one of the worst ways of recruiting, it has the least consistency to actually what happens subsequently.\nPL: Yeah, lots of data on that.\nMM: Absolutely. So one of the things we really stress actually is providing a work sample test, let the individual try out a piece of the work. You will see whether they can do it and also they can self-select about whether they want to do it or not because many, many neurodiverse people are actually very well aware of their own profile, their own strengths and their own challenges and can choose therefore whether this job's going to suit them or it isn't going to, and recruitment should always be a matching process from both sides. I had a really interesting experience with Hampshire Police. Hampshire Police are probably the most advanced in dealing with candidates with dyslexia and related conditions in the UK. And I first met Peter Phillips who is their expert in this area probably about 10 or 12 years ago when I was running an awareness course for Hampshire Police about dyslexia because they discovered that a lot of their recruits were actually having difficulty on their training programme and had not disclosed that they were dyslexic. Well it's been really interesting to see the travel with that organisation, because initially they were completely innocent of what these conditions might be and they were doing all those sort of things - writing complicated job descriptions and not necessarily encouraging recruitment from people who might be on the spectrum. Now they have screening in place for all their recruits - it's voluntary, obviously, but they say over the last five years they've helped 150 police officers and they've actually been able to calibrate what that has meant to victims of crime because those individuals, as trained police officers, are very often very empathetic and they have found that this has had a serious business impact.\nPL: It's a great example and you make a really good point. It's like all these diversity and inclusion conversations, it's not a 'nice to have', it's good business sense, isn't it. You talked about reasonable adjustments and that's the thing that I think is a barrier, isn't it, for a lot of HR professionals. They imagine that there are going to be a lot of very complex and very expensive adjustments to make if they go down this road. What's the reality on the ground?\nKW: I think it's, again, like we mentioned earlier, understanding that person and what they need but you don't need to change the entire organisation but just make sure there are options there for that person. So for example if you have an office where lots of the meeting rooms are glass all the way around, are there blinds there so if someone there is in the room that has autism and everyone walking past is really distracting and they can't concentrate on what you're saying, they can just pull down the blinds and then they're focusing. But in reality any adjustment that we provide as a suggestion for our consultants to other companies and clients, they're so minimal, they're really small but they make a massive difference to someone's every day.\nPL: Yeah. I pulled some data, I think it was your data, Jill, about the US Job Accommodation Network - they did a survey. 59% of common adjustment types cost nothing, which is a really good thing to know isn't it because that's not the perception.\nJM: Yeah. I think most reasonable adjustments are likely to be low cost and often they're universal and by universal adjustments we mean that they can benefit a huge range of people, whether you're neurodivergent or not, and I think, as you say Kirsty, that one of the real keys there is to understand what's important for that individual and then to be creating that culture where anybody in the organisation can request a reasonable adjustment or a workplace adjustment. And I think that's really important because if someone hasn't disclosed a condition, and they might not want to, they can still request an adjustment then that'll help them perform at their best when they're at work.\nKW: That's true actually. There's a bigger picture there of accepting when someone's within the team, for example that they're autistic or they have a condition or even if you don't know they have, if they're requesting adjustments, that's just a normal thing, that you're allowed to do that. And a lot of our consultants that are still getting used to their autism and how it impacts them, they're really fearful to ask other clients for adjustments because they don't want to stand out and they don't want to be shown as someone different that needs all these adjustments that somebody else might not.\nPL: Thinking about people with these conditions, they bring talents and capacities to an organisation that other people don't, so it's about managing talent isn't it?\nMM: Well, to an extent. Because there is certainly the case, and I've written a book about it, about the creative talents of people who are dyslexic and so on. On the other hand, this is a spectrum disorder and many people are concerned that you can have someone who is just good at their job but not super talented, and then if we raise that expectation, this is also about talent management, those who are more seriously affected have too high an expectation made of them.\nPL: Okay.\nMM: So we have to be a little careful, and I think it's just going back to what we said at the beginning which is you've got to know the person, you've got to understand what their strengths are, what perhaps some of their challenges are, they may be very minor or they may not be, depending on the extent to which they're affected.\nPL: How do you handle that Kirsty?\nKW: The talent management?\nPL: Yeah because obviously you've got a much bigger pool of people happily identifying as in this cohort than most other organisations.\nKW: Yeah. So everybody that we place into a project that's matched to their skillset completely, so it's all about using their strengths and knowing what their strengths are, maybe their IT strengths in particular, but also their cognitive strengths and areas that just come hand in hand with their condition. And when they are placed we're keeping track of that, alongside their line manager in house at Auticon, but also their line manager in a client project, because there are certain things, or certain situations, where they're doing their job but they're bored, they're really bored because they're unchallenged and quite often sometimes they're put into a client project and people - they're still a little bit wary, they're still a little bit scared, so they're giving them working thinking 'they're autistic and they might not be able to do this', and that is not the case, they can do often quite a lot more than someone that isn't autistic. So the talent management sometimes has the flipside whereas I think most of the time we assume that's to help somebody that maybe isn't performing, but to help managers actually ensure that they have the work that can help them perform at their best and more so than others.\nPL: Training for line managers Jill?\nJM: Yeah. I think training for line managers is really, really important. It's something that we've actually done at CIPD as well ourselves. We've done training for our line managers and people who are involved in hiring but then broadened that out to all employees who could come along to lunch and learn sessions.\nPL: Now Margaret. I think you delivered some of that training for the CIPD didn't you?\nMM: Yeah.\nPL: What did it involve?\nMM: Very early on actually, what we did was to provide an e-learning programme from the British Dyslexia Association, so that employers could start to look at it. And it was used with recruiting staff and with managers at the CIPD.\nPL: So, Kirsty, Auticon, I'm interested in your clients. So do your clients come to you specifically because they want to play into this, it's important to them. Or do they come to you because you're the best?\nKW: The best, obviously! They come for an IT consultant first. Quite often what we've found about clients - they have a skills gap and then they're hearing a lot about neurodiversity and autistic IT consultants and the benefits that they have and because we exclusively hire people that are autistic and IT consultants, that's why they come to us because what they actually say is they're hearing all these good things and they have no idea where to find the people and find the talent. So they come directly to us. And when they do and when someone goes on board related to that training and topic, we always give a 90 minute training session and to the team before we allow our consultant to go in there, so that we have the chance to give the training, raise awareness and correct all of the horrible misconceptions that are quite often there.\nPL: And have you had bad experiences?\nKW: No, none.\nPL: Is that right?\nKW: Yeah, nothing at all.\nPL: So you haven't had clients struggle with...?\nKW: There have been challenges, but every single consultant that we hire comes with a coach, so when they join us they have a dedicated job coach to support them. But the clients get that coach basically as well because whenever anything comes up, maybe they're a little bit unsure about how to communicate, or maybe there is a challenge with work pace, for example, or performance, they come to the coach and the in-house line manager at Auticon to ask for advice and then we sort it out with them.\nPL: As Kirsty says, people don't know where to go to recruit people with these particular talents and abilities, even if they directly want to recruit them. So how do you, as an HR professional, set about making your organisation very open to that so that I imagine people will come to you? Because we talked about this, Jill, in the diversity inclusion arena and all sorts of other things, LGBTQ and BAME issues and all sorts. How do you actually make yourself as an organisation appealing in a genuine way, in the sense that you're going to deliver on your promises?\nJM: I think there's some really subtle things you can do that actually can speak volumes. One of the things I'm thinking of is on your job adverts, just like many organisations now are happy to talk flexible working, why not put 'Happy to talk workplace adjustments,' or 'reasonable adjustments', whichever is most suitable.\nPL: Yeah, and has anyone ever seen that on an ad? I don't think I have?\nKW: No.\nMM: No.\nPL: Okay, good thought.\nJM: But also I think it's making the actual working experience for people live your values. So if you really want to be an inclusive organisation, you have to make sure that that is what you're breeding internally. You need to make sure that people are aware of neurodiversity, you need to look at your people practices, you need to look at the whole employee lifecycle to make sure that you're not screening people out.\nPL: Other thoughts on becoming a destination employer?\nMM: I think one of things we've found that's been really helpful has been having internal networks in organisations. So you know like you get a women's network, you get a black and ethnic minorities network, in fact there were no dyslexic networks until about 12 years ago and the British Dyslexia Association has really pushed on this and has provided a guide for how to set up internal networks, a guide for mentoring, all of which are free by the way, so downloadable from the website.\nPL: Though presumably, Kirsty, networks don't work for everyone?\nKW: Yeah, for people that are autistic they probably wouldn't go. But I think knowing that something, or more so, someone, is there is quite crucial. That's why I think a lot of the time challenges are quite low when we are placing people because they have the support of a job coach. If there was nobody, they would be trying to navigate it and not really, unsure of what's going on, probably get it wrong and make mistakes. But when they've got that person they can trust and speak to, whether that's a coach, a mentor, a line manager in particular, that works really well.\nPL: So we've talked about making reasonable adjustments, people working easily within ordinary office environments, not necessarily places like the wonderful Auticon where it's all set up for exactly this purpose, but mainstream organisations and I know, Margaret, you've got an issue that's popping up a lot that it's a problem?\nMM: Yes, it's about being able to have assistive software on the general system for an organisation, their general platform. And the problem seems to be about making sure that that system is safe. So they're concerned about viruses being introduced, or something similar to this.\nPL: Understandably.\nMM: Absolutely understandably, but I think it's a challenge at the moment that we're seeing quite a lot of. And it's quite interesting because if you take the most secure organisation, GCHQ, then they have a long history of employing individuals with dyslexia because of some of their abilities, in some cases to visualise in 3D, and also of autistic individuals because of their attention to detail, and they have managed it. So there must be solutions to this. But we know it's something that IT departments who perhaps are less aware of neurodiversity are actually throwing up and saying, no you can't use your assistive software here because it may introduce a risk into our IT structures.\nPL: Interesting. We need to wrap this up but before we do, I just want to ask you all - this is new territory for a lot of people, even for HR practitioners. It seems to me that awareness is on the rise and I've come across some great examples, certainly in Jill's research work. Do you have others that you'd like to share?\nMM: The accounting companies have done quite well, Ernst & Young, KPMG and so on, but mainly relating to their accountancy trainees who are going to do exams and we've worked extensively with professional exam bodies to make sure reasonable adjustments are put into place. The other interesting area is trade unions. Trade unions are doing a lot of work. Prospect Trade Union, for example, which deals with white collar workers, has put neurodiversity in the forefront of its strategy for the whole of the trade union. TSSA which deals with Crossrail and so on, are very well informed and are doing good work in that area. So there's some really good examples out there of what to do.\nPL: I came across a lovely one, in Florida, Rising Tide? I think I found it in the CIPD's data on this somewhere, a carwash brand in the States that primarily hires autistic people, they've got about 80 I think now, and that seems to be going extremely well for them and they are radically changing their whole way of hiring off the back of the experience, all the things we've been talking about I think. So it's coming isn't it, but there's not that many examples right now.\nJM: I saw a great example on the BBC website and I think the example takes the conversation past just your employees or your job applicants to looking at customers or clients as well. I was looking at their media city tours and they have a fabulous video on there which gives you an insight into all the sounds, the sights and the experience you'll have when you go on the tour and it's interactive so you can click on the sound link to see, for example, what it's going to be like when you enter the carpark before you even get to reception for the tour.\nPL: That is sophisticated.\nJM: Yes, yes and I think that was a really powerful thing for me to think actually we need to think about our customers as well, because if we're thinking about a significant proportion of the population who are neurodivergent, it makes clear business sense, as well as the right thing to do, to be making our workplaces neurodiverse friendly. PL: So more information for people who are listening to this and would like to find out more. Jill, there must be stuff on the CIPD site?\nJM: Yes, well at CIPD we worked with Optimise to produce a guide for people managers and for HR managers on neurodiversity at work and it has two main things, aims of the guide. The first is to increase awareness and understanding and so it's for people who are very new to the area. But also it provides some practical examples of things that you might like to do as an employer to make your organisation more neurodiversity friendly.\nPL: Thank you everyone, it was a really great discussion: Dr Jill Miller, Kirsty Wilson and Margaret Malpas.

We hear from Sandy Pepper, Professor of Management Practice at the London School of Economics, Charles Cotton, CIPD’s Senior Adviser Pay and Reward, and Julia Hanna of Verditer Consulting.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:28:26\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: Last month the Institute for Fiscal Studies proved that the pay gap between bosses and workers is widening. Average CEO pay among FTSE 100 companies was 145 times higher in 2017 than the salary of the average worker. Twenty years ago that multiplier was 47. Different organisations take wildly different positions on how senior bosses should be remunerated. In May, Julian Richer, Founder CEO of Richer Sounds, handed 60% of his business to his 500 employees citing 'people before profits'. Over at housebuilder Persimmon, CEO Jeff Fairburn finally stepped down at Christmas after years of criticism about excessive pay at the company when his PS75m bonus proved to be a step too far.\nNow all companies in the UK with more than 250 people have to report the ratio between the CEO pay and the median pay of their employees. But will that make much difference and are big, complex reward packages much of a motivator anyway?\nJoining me to discuss executive pay and the psychology of motivation, I'm joined by Sandy Pepper, Professor of Management Practice at the LSE; Charles Cotton, Senior Adviser Pay and Reward here at the CIPD and Julia Hanna of Verditer Consulting.\nSandy, we have been talking about the executive pay system and how it's broken for years now, we've been making podcasts about it. But that gap between CEO pay and average worker pay - it keeps getting wider. Why aren't things changing?\nSandy Pepper: So I think this is actually a little bit of basic economics. The pay of all employees, the labour market for all employees, is generally relatively efficient. There are lots of people in it. And so for an efficient market you need lots of components, reasonably homogenous products, lots of information, and in that way the market can establish the correct price.\nPL: It self-corrects?\nSP: It self-corrects. The labour market for senior executives is nothing like that. It's a very imperfect market. The products, if you like, the senior executives, are not homogenous, they're all very different and there is not lots of information - there's more than there used to be - but companies still don't know the ins and outs of what their most senior executives are going to be capable of doing or not doing. So we don't have a very efficient market and as a consequence of that, the pay, which is the price in a labour market, is not calculated correctly in senior executive reward markets.\nPL: So Charles, CIPD has been looking at this, this year, the numbers. How much are CEOs, it's FTSE 100 and 250 isn't it, how much are they being paid?\nCharles Cotton: Well we've noticed that pay has been going up remorselessly since 2008 for FTSE 100 executives. Then from 2013 onwards, it's kind of seesawed from year to year between a band of just around PS4m at the top and about PS3.5m at the bottom, so it's been bouncing up and down between that band over the last few years.\nPL: So not a huge range.\nCC: No, but you must remember that over the same period pay for your typical employee still isn't back to where it was in real terms before the 2008 financial crisis. We're seeing levels of quite high personal debt and the belief now that work isn't, as it used to be, a route out of poverty.\nPL: So Julia, you've worked in-house. What impact does that thinking that Charles just described have on people throughout the organisation. It must be demotivating?\nJulia Hanna: Oh absolutely. I think there was some CIPD research a few years ago that said something like 54% of employees felt that executive pay was excessive and that has a real impact on engagement levels, trust in corporate business, potentially productivity. Companies only have a finite amount of money to spend. The more they're putting into executive pay, the less they're putting into pay for other employees but also in investment in plant, in investment in people. And Charles mentioned work no longer being a route out of poverty. If there's not investment in people then their careers and roles can't grow. So it really does have a massive impact on engagement.\nPL: Thinking about how CEOs are paid, I mean long-term incentive plans - they're the norm really and have been the norm since the Greenbury Report. Would that be right?\nSP: The first long-term incentive plans in the UK were introduced by British Telecom and the Prudential and Reuters just before or around the time of the Greenbury Report. But Greenbury established a norm.\nPL: And it sounded like a good idea didn't it. But you're not a fan?\nSP: It sounded like a good idea at the time. Indeed, I believed in them at the time and in my previous life I was involved in implementing them. But I have come to believe that long-term incentive plans are part of the problem, not part of the solution.\nPL: Why is that?\nSP: They're very complex and they're not very well understood either by the public generally and often by the people who participate in them.\nPL: So for people who don't deal in these things, can you just give us an idiot's guide to what they might consist of?\nSP: So a long-term incentive plan. If you were participating in a plan, you would be awarded some shares on day one, linked to the performance of your company in some way. So let's say you were given 100 shares, they won't vest for at least three years, possibly longer. For them to vest, your company has to meet a series of financial performance targets. The effect of this is you received a very complex instrument that you find it difficult to value. In three years' time who knows what the circumstances in the market might be. You mentioned Persimmon earlier, the Persimmon LTIP that was set up at a time before the government started to push lots of money to encourage house building, so the building firms benefitted hugely from an upsurge in the market.\nPL: So it was widely perceived as unfair as well?\nSP: Widely perceived as unfair, yeah. And it can go the other way, you can have very successful companies, companies performing very successfully, who have performance conditions that work against them. Maybe their metric is with a basket of other companies, maybe some of those companies are taken over during the year. That gives them apparently huge upside performance in terms of share price or total shareholder return and your company which has just been growing organically, doing the right thing, gets penalised because of a relative performance.\nPL: So false comparisons.\nSP: Absolutely.\nPL: And thinking about podcasts we've made in this arena before and the complexity of executive pay packages, certainly it seemed from our interviews that a lot of CEOs don't understand their own remuneration packages, they are so complex. And if they don't understand them, it's hard to see how they can really be much of a motivator.\nJH: Yes absolutely. When working in-house, we do some changes to long-term incentive plans and people tend to want to participate because it's a status symbol, particularly if it's only open to certain echelons of the organisation, but if you actually ask people to explain it or to articulate the value that they're getting, they would really struggle to do that.\nPL: Thinking more widely about fairness and the appearance of fairness, the reality of fairness, the measures that are used to establish whether a CEO is actually making a difference in the organisation. Would it be fair to say they are reasonably narrow, as you say around how the competitor is doing, how the business is doing. Should they be wider? Should they be more about the well-being of the staff or eco issues? I mean is that something to do?\nCC: Definitely. I mean at the moment how performance is defined is on a narrow range of financial metrics and we think, at the CIPD, that actually success should be defined more broadly looking at both the customer and the employee experience. We also think that focusing on one individual, as if the chief executive has personally achieved what all the individuals within the workforce have contributed to, is probably not correct.\nPL: And demotivating in itself.\nCC: And demotivating in itself. And also, as Sandy was talking about earlier, then the only way to reward these individuals is pushing huge amounts of money at them is probably not the best way of rewarding them and potentially demotivates the rest of the workforce. And there are other approaches as well as looking at improving the talent pipeline. You know, Sandy was talking about how restricted it is, at the moment we're seeing various initiatives to get organisations to widen that, and encourage more women into senior management and ultimately into chief executive levels as well.\nPL: What do you think the best options are Julia?\nJH: I think it's two-fold really. I think for the long-term incentive plans, if we are looking at it, I think the measures need to be different. I totally agree with Sandy.\nPL: What sort of things would you like to see?\nJH: I think if we're looking at financial measures, they should be ones that the senior team can actually influence rather than, as Sandy described, things that are influenced by the market and things like that. I think that's the first thing. Secondly, agreeing with Charles as well, that the metrics need to be much, much wider. Economic, social, governance type metrics. The UN has published 17 sustainable development goals. Those sorts of things can be linked into, whether it's long-term incentives, but executive pay as far as targets and goals are concerned.\nPL: Harder to measure?\nJH: Potentially. But I think that's down to good target setting at the beginning as opposed to trying to retrofit things at the end of the process. But I think things potentially are changing. Richard Walker who is the MD of Iceland was on BBC Question Time and he referred to the role of business changing, no longer there just to enrich shareholders. So I think there is an appetite for having broader metrics and understanding that it isn't just all about the financials and that we define success in a much broader way.\nPL: And I think there was a piece in the Wall Street Journal not long ago saying more companies are linking CEO reward to sustainability targets, so without wishing to diminish that aspiration in any way, there's a fashion element here isn't there of what plays well in the media and in PR terms about how you're defining company performance?\nSP: So if I can be a bit radical here?\nPL: Please do.\nSP: I think you use metrics to run businesses. You shouldn't use metrics to decide how you pay people. CEOs are perfectly capable of working out what the most important thing for their company is at a particular time. And it changes hugely. The Persimmon issue - a long-term incentive plan was set up at a time when there was one set of market conditions which a few months later changed radically. So I think we have made the mistake of being on this search for the perfect metrics and I personally believe that you need metrics to run businesses, but we don't need to tie pay to metrics. We can do pay in a different way.\nPL: What do you think is the big motivator for CEOs if it's not pay, because they say it's not pay don't they in surveys?\nSP: They say it's not pay. There is a long history of research into motivation that distinguishes between what the psychologists call intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Another of my criticisms or critiques of the thinking about pay over the last 30 years is all the focus has been on extrinsic motivation and we haven't given enough consideration to things like virtues and vision and all the things that really make us go to work. Once we're beyond a certain point in terms of having sufficient money to support a lifestyle that we feel comfortable with, additional amounts of money don't really motivate people, it's other things.\nJH: I'd agree. I think most senior managers, the executives that I deal with, actually want to do a good job. They want to do the right thing and we are in danger, particularly with the metrics and things like that, of actually defining success too narrowly.\nPL: Yeah, I mean thinking about the level of pay and as you say alternate organisations, I do remember us saying in a previous podcast, we looked at some data that said CEOs weren't that bothered about how much they were paid as long as it was about what other CEOs were paid in that kind of arena, and it was more about parity than the number, which I thought was really interesting.\nSP: So this is fascinating, and it is all about fairness. I remember a debate I had with the CEO of one company and he said, 'The only thing that matters to me is that I'm paid more than my brother,' and his brother was a very successful entrepreneur, had set his own company up. You know, perfectly humanly understandably this CEO's measure of success was how well he was remunerated in comparison with his particular referent which was his brother. Now in other conversations with other CEOs they all had a referent group, and if it was a mining company it was other mining companies, insurance it was other insurance companies. What they wanted to feel was that they were paid, in inverted commas, fairly, in comparison with people in their referent groups.\nPL: That's interesting because I think, clearly, they understand the issue about fairness don't they. But, you know, we have this pay ratio regulatory system now so it will be clearly understood about how much the CEO is getting versus most of the other people. There's a fairness issue there too but that doesn't seem to be landing in the say way does it, why isn't that impacting more? Do you think it will?\nSP: Because the comparison is with your referent group. It isn't with the population generally.\nPL: But is that the psychology that needs to shift?\nSP: Possibly, but this is not an easy thing to do.\nPL: So that is the task for Remuneration Committees isn't it, Julia? Charles? So are they thinking too narrowly?\nCC: Well I think they're perhaps as a constitute to just focusing on the chief executive and we would like a broader consideration of not only just the chief executives but how reward is distributed throughout the organisation, and thinking about, well, how can we reward employees more fairly for their contributions. So can we give them a slice of the profits through a profit share scheme? Can we give a slice of the profits through an employee share ownership programme? And looking at it from a governance perspective should we take into consideration what employees are feeling about executive remuneration within the organisation? How can we take that on board as well, as well as talking to executives, talking about actually how would you like to get rewarded? Would you like smaller but potentially simpler and more immediate rewards than the current arrangement that you have at the moment?\nPL: Well, Julia, you deal with RemCos. Do they think like that? I'm guessing they don't.\nJH: Not all! I will be honest. However I think again, with the new Corporate Governance Code, I think two things are going to happen. One is they've got a wider and a broader remit so they need to start thinking about how the executive pay aligns with the rest of the organisation. So I think that's going to be very interesting to see how that pans out. And we've certainly seen a huge increase in requests for Remuneration Committee training since January, since the new regulations came in. So I think there are some organisations that are taking the broader thing very seriously. I think as well the CEO pay ratios, some organisations will treat them as a compliance issue, a tick box issue. Others, there's the opportunity to use it as a catalyst for change. There's no right answer to these things, it depends on your sector and all of those kinds of things but just putting it out in the public domain will mean that it sits on the board's agenda and the RemCo's agenda very, very clearly because obviously there's reputation. The media will be all over this when they start to get published, in exactly the same way as they have done with the gender pay gap.\nPL: Yes, and the idea of it broadening the remit of the RemCos seems like step one doesn't it, because I was thinking about the layer down from CEO. We always talk about CEO pay but looking at the latest data I've got, it's FTSE 100 companies, there's over 1,300 people in those companies who are earning nearly PS1m a year each, so that's a significant number isn't it? And should we be widening the discussion and getting away from this idea of a handful of people at the very top and thinking right across. It sounds like that's what you're saying?\nCC: Yes, I mean I think it's important. At the moment maybe a lot of attention, and perhaps justifiably, has been focused on the individual at the top, the CEO, though in many instances they may not be the highest earner in the organisation. So I think it's only fair that we should be looking as well at what about the level just below? What are these individuals doing to justify this amount of money? How is it being distributed in terms of long-term incentives or increasingly there's a focus now on the benefits, especially pensions and whether those are fair compared to what the rest of the workforce is getting. But I think the overarching focus within an organisation should be on the financial well-being of its employees and what are we doing to promote that?\nPL: Is employee ownership going to become more of a thing?\nSP: I think we've been talking about this for a long time. Again in my younger and more idealistic days, I thought employee share ownership was a fantastic concept and should be encouraged. Today I'm afraid I'm not particularly persuaded...\nPL: What that it's a good idea?\nSP: ...that it's a good idea.\nPL: Why not?\nSP: Well, the classic example I suppose is Enron whereby employees had so much of their personal wealth caught up in shares in the company that they worked for, when the company went bust they lost everything.\nPL: It works for John Lewis though doesn't it?\nSP: Yeah but they don't have shares...\nPL: Ownership?\nSP: ...that's different. Well, they don't really have ownership do they. I mean they're called partners but the company's owned by a trust. I mean, sure John Lewis...\nPL: They have a voice don't they?\nSP: They have a voice. I don't think the voice constitutes ownership. I don't think if you talk to somebody on the shop floor at John Lewis they'd say they owned part of the company. But they certainly have a voice. John Lewis is a delightful example but it's also pretty unique in terms of its structure and its constitution and its values.\nPL: So do you think we'll see more, Charles?\nCC: Well in this knowledge, and I suppose service and an innovation-based, economy, success is a collective endeavour so you would expect more focus on team rewards and participation and information sharing and voice coming up and down the organisation. So all those reward practices and wider people management practices that support this - obviously that's going to have a big impact. And those organisations that aren't able to do that will suffer in the marketplace. It's just keeping yourself abreast of latest thinking, latest developments and, unfortunately in reward we're often looking at theories that were developed many decades ago, you know Maslow and Hertzberg back in the 40s and 50s, when it comes to executive pay, principal agency theory which was developed back in the 70s. So it's important that Remuneration Committees start thinking, well what's the latest evidence out there? What's that showing? Should we start rethinking or reframing how we reward, not only just the executives but everybody throughout the organisation?\nPL: Let's talk about organisations that feel they want to do things, but the anxiety's always going to be the disadvantage of being a first time mover, isn't it Julia? Do you encounter this?\nJH: Yes certainly. The conversation we have with Remuneration Committees is all about what is everybody else doing.\nPL: They like the idea but they don't want to be first.\nJH: Yes absolutely. And I think it's we always counter and say well actually it almost doesn't matter what everybody else is doing, you need to work out what your purpose and vision is for your business, what your strategy is and then the organisation structure and the people structure and the pay structures and things like that should follow. And I agree with Sandy the point with regard to equity, sometimes it's about setting out what fairness means in our organisation and this therefore is how the reward fits in with that and then people will either sign up to that if that works for their own culture and their own thinking, or they'll decide that the organisation's not right for them and potentially go elsewhere. But it's about being clear and I think part of the problem within the reward circle is that we're not necessarily clear, we don't like talking about things, it's a bit of a dark art and employees really don't understand how their pay is set, how to progress their pay. Whereas if we were actually a bit clearer and a bit more transparent about all these things, it might actually help.\nPL: That is a really interesting point.\nSP: I wrote a piece for Harvard Business Review a couple of years ago on this whole topic of the psychology of incentives and somewhere along the line in the discussion they said, 'So where's the case study?' and I said, 'Well I don't have a case study yet because nobody's done it.' Now interestingly somebody has now done it, which is the Weir Group. So we do now have the first signs of a company changing the way it does senior executive reward, actually reducing the potential rewards for top executives quite substantially but paying them in a way that has a longer term focus and is more certain.\nPL: Is it possible for you to give us a short summary of how they're doing it?\nSP: Yeah, so they had a classic long-term incentive plan type thing with big targets, lots of complex metrics and a new chair of the Remuneration Committee, Clare Chapman, who has been involved amongst other things in a piece of research called The Purposeful Company, a report, and is very much minded that pay arrangements need to change. So she worked with the CEO and with various advisers to replace their long-term incentive plan with a restricted share plan. So I mean still not quite as simple as I would have liked it to be, but nevertheless the executives got shares, they had no performance targets, just as long as they stayed in place over three, four, five, six, seven years they got the benefits of ownership. So much more certain than long-term incentive plans. And they reduced the total rewards that were payable under this plan very substantially. I think they cut the long-term bonus element by about 50%.\nPL: Would you have said yes to that, Julia?\nJH: Yes, I think I would. I think definitely. Certainly, the long-term incentive side of things has ratcheted up because of the uncertainty of the payments. And I think receiving something now as opposed to another sum at some potential future date maybe, makes sense. And I think that having that certainty and actually making things simpler makes a massive amount of difference.\nPL: Charles, I know CIPD's bringing out a report on executive pay shortly. As I understand it, part of that involves you'd like to rebrand RemCos entirely and call them something entirely different and make them work entirely differently?\nCC: We would like organisations to think about repurposing their Remuneration Committees and potentially even changing their names.\nPL: To?\nCC: Perhaps People and Organisational Committees, or just to basically give the impetus to think about reward, remuneration, more widely within the organisation, saying: Well, this is what we're giving the chief executive, how does that relate to the others in the workforce? Why are we rewarding people in this way? What are the skills, behaviours, expectations we want from these individuals.\nPL: So we need to wrap this up but before we do I just want to ask you two whether you feel that sounds like the way forward?\nSP: Yeah, I've been interested in pay for a long time and I've done research in the executive pay area for quite a long time, but in the last few years my focus has been much more about the purpose of companies and this phrase 'people and organisation' which I really like, because I think actually pay is a presenting problem. If you go to a psychotherapist with a sore back and he says, 'Actually the problem's got something to do with the way you were brought up,' - I'm being slightly glib - but I mean this idea actually that the presenting problem is not the real problem, and I think in a sense the real issue that our companies face is a much broader one than how the pay of the top people is calculated.\nPL: And Julia talked about the zeitgeist earlier. Do you think the zeitgeist is finally right now for organisations to take this thinking on board?\nJH: I think so, and I think there's a definite opportunity for HR to really push the agenda on this. And I agree it isn't just about pay. There's a whole host of reasons why we all come to work. Pay clearly has a role to play, but actually widening the remit and actually looking, not only top to bottom in the organisation, but also more widely than the pay, bonus and share plans, and thinking about all of the other reward elements, intrinsic and extrinsic, will have a definite impact.\nPL: Well thanks to all of you: Charles Cotton, Professor Sandy Pepper and Julia Hanna. There is more on the website as always. And look out for that new CIPD report on executive pay soon.

      "summary": "Many organisations still shy away from workforce planning because this important combined business practice and HR-led strategy appears to be too complicated a task.\nThis podcast encourages all businesses to start small and build on the data and analysis that will inform the practices and develop the key skills required for talent acquisition and management, succession planning and change. We bring together subject experts Dr Wendy Hirsh FCIPD, researcher and consultant for the Institute for Employment Studies, Ally Weeks MCIPD, HR content consultant at the CIPD, and Olly Britnell, Global Head of Analytics and HR Strategy at Experian, in the discussion.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:25:18\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: It's been about a decade since workforce planning was a really popular business practice. In these uncertain times it's important to set business direction beyond a year, which may explain why we're now seeing a resurgence of interest in it. To shed some light on this I'm joined by two expert guests and I'll let them introduce themselves.\nWendy Hirsh: Yes, my name's Wendy Hirsh. I'm an independent researcher and consultant. I also do a lot of work with the Institute for Employment Studies in Sussex and oddly I started out as workforce planner - there aren't so many around - so I'm a mathematician who's migrated into workforce planning and then into proper people. So I'm a bit of a workforce planning geek.\nPL: Perfect, you're in the right place then. Ally.\nAlly Weeks: Yes, I'm Ally Weeks and I've worked for the CIPD for the last eight years. However prior to that I have worked most of my working life in HR practice and currently my role is as HR content consultant.\nPL: Now I was on the CIPD site the other day and I was looking at the workforce planning factsheet which I think you wrote Ally didn't you?\nAW: I did yes.\nPL: And I saw a phrase on there which really struck me. It said that workforce planning can be the most effective activity an organisation can engage in. That's a big claim.\nAW: Yes, it is and I think it's really come into its own recently, especially with Brexit on the horizon. There was a few of us got together at CIPD when Brexit was announced and we were all discussing how we can actually support our HR practitioners with how they can actually get through this time and plan for the future and that's when I just hit on the idea to get back to basics and let's look at reviewing our workforce practices and actually starting to use workforce practice methodology to help us through this difficult time. Also many organisations are going through so much change. There's a lot of automation and AI. What better time really to see this resurgence in workforce planning?\nPL: Absolutely but researching this ourselves, Wendy, it was a big thing ten years ago, it's kind of fallen away. Why was that?\nWH: Well it was actually a very big thing in the 1960s and 70s. It was a mature discipline, getting on for 50 years ago and much further back, the Chinese early empires built a section of the wall a week, they were supreme workforce planners, I think it has tended always to fall away when employers have not found it so hard to get staff and it always tends to come back when labour is tight and when people are worried about skill shortages and have to think further ahead. Also, as Ally has hinted, it comes back when people are nervous about change and at the moment you have both of those, you have a nervousness about change, not just Brexit but much more widely, and you also have quite severe skill shortages in an economy that oddly, considering the pickle we're in, has very high levels of employment and very low levels of unemployment, so employers can't bank on just going out and finding the people they need so easily they need to think a bit further ahead.\nPL: It feels like a big task for organisations that haven't really formally got their arms around it, what puts people off?\nAW: I think that some organisations will see this as a barrier. They just hear the term workforce planning and fine, and look at it and think gosh that's far too complicated, and where on earth do I start? But what we really want to get, the aim of this podcast and the message to get across, is to start small.\nWH: I think two particular things can put people off. One is they think they have to do a deep dive into data before they do anything else and they don't know what data to deep dive into and they probably don't have that data to hand. They also worry that they've got to then have a workforce plan and the idea of a thing called a workforce plan also puts people off and that idea works in some organisations and not in others, it's perfectly possible to do really useful workforce planning without having a document called a workforce plan. And then if I can just add a third issue, I think they feel that managers want them to do it and give it to them rather than seeing it as a way of working with business managers, which I see it as being.\nPL: That brings me to the question of if you're setting up a taskforce in your organisation to do this, who should be sitting on that because it's not just HR is it?\nAW: Exactly. You're exactly right. This is a business plan, it should not sit solely within the HR department.\nPL: I've seen references to soft and hard workforce planning, discuss.\nWH: Well, as a mathematician I find it a bit odd that when we measure attitudes we suddenly call it quantitative data, in fact we're looking at different sorts of information and different sorts of decision, we're looking at information about what's there now, much of that data is probably what you call hard or factual data. We're also looking at what may happen in future. We're also, and it's something HR has rather lost I think, need to be looking at recent trends and most of the information systems we have are not very good at giving us trends. But also increasingly linking that with attitudinal data which may be called soft. I'm not sure I find the terms hard and soft all that useful, but I think as with anything you think about where has this information come from; how much do I trust it what does it tell me; is it useful?\nPL: So quality of your data?\nWH: Quality but not necessarily ultra-precision. I think another barrier for people is they think if they can't measure everything to the fifth decimal point, as a mathematician I just ask is this a big number, is it a small number, is it getting bigger, is it getting smaller? If people used that thinking more often they wouldn't be so concerned about umpteenth accuracies. It's an uncertain business and we want to know which way something's moving.\nPL: Shall we move on to stages, where do we start with this?\nWH: There are some key building blocks in workforce planning. Workforce planning is about the workforce, it's about resourcing and therefore it's both about the work you need done, which we would often call demand or need, and the supply, the other side of the equation, of the people who are going to do it. You can't do workforce planning if you don't look at both of those. HR tends as a function to look much more at the supply of people than the requirement for people, but with our great concern at the moment about productivity and about technological change, those are issues where you really have to redefine the people you need, not just the people you can get.\nPL: Plus, we are projecting into the future, so it's a complex and necessarily not a factual business is it? You are imagining what you will need.\nWH: Yes, and you're using judgements and there are different ways of using judgement. Having good data on what's there now is a good start point. Also, you're then looking at where is it going to be easy to find people and where is it going to be difficult. And you can find people internally from the people you've already got in post, or creating successes internally. You also have to be aware of who you can get externally. And that means understanding your labour market, again a well-developed science but not one discussed perhaps quite enough by HR which goes out one job at a time to recruit. That's not the same as understanding the labour market you're in.\nPL: As you say, you're not necessarily working towards a hard and fast plan, you're more working towards a set of what, aspirations? But they'll change over time. This is contingency planning; it's going to be agile, it's going to evolve, it's going to change. What sort of timeframe should people be looking at realistically?\nWH: I think that's a really interesting question and when you look at good workforce planning as, for example, we have been doing with our recent work for CIPD at IES, what we found was good workforce planning on several different timescales. So we found some examples of excellent, extremely short-term workforce planning, for example in the residential care sector where you have to have the right number of people on the staff each hour of each day. And as the numbers of people in the residential home go up and down you need to be looking at that. They need to be safe, they need to be well cared for, but you don't want to be paying for a lot of people who aren't needed.\nPL: So what sort of timeframe were they working here?\nWH: Well, they're working on every 24 hours and they're modifying their staffing each week in terms of not just the number of residents in a home but how ill they are.\nPL: So it's like bed allocation in hospitals.\nWH: Very much like the systems nurses developed many years ago, now not used so well in hospitals, to make sure they had enough people. So that's an example of very short-term planning. So would our many transport systems require very short-term planning. Commonly people are looking at a year at the sort of annual budget cycle - that's relevant, but it's a very narrow definition of what workforce planning is, just getting the headcount right for the year isn't really very thoughtful workforce planning but important. And then I think how far ahead you look depends on the business you're in, so when I've worked with sectors like pharmaceuticals, I know Ally's worked in that sector also, the product cycles are very long, people are looking what five to ten years ahead, sometimes longer?\nAW: Yes, I guess sometimes we had to bring things to market very, very quickly otherwise competitors would come in and there was very expensive amount of research and development. So workforce planning was an integral part of HR and business planning.\nPL: And presumably you don't need to opt for one timeframe do you, you can plan across various timespans.\nWH: Not at all, and I think if nothing else that conversation with line managers about on what timeframes should we be having a dialogue about the workforce, and make it plural, may be a very useful way of doing it, because it's not the case that we only want to be looking very long-term. But neither is it the case that this rather unfortunate habit of seeing workforce planning as just a budget setting exercise, that's not been particularly helpful, I think.\nPL: And different questions for different timescales presumably?\nWH: And possibly for different bits of the workforce within the same organisation.\nPL: Would it be fair to say this whole field is getting a bit more complex than perhaps it was, thinking about different ways of employing people, thinking about tech, demographics, all those things, they all play in.\nWH: They do all play in, I don't know that it's getting more difficult, I think we're making it more fussy.\nPL: Why do you say that?\nWH: Because if you look over the last 50 years or more we've had huge recessions, we've had whole industries disappear, and when I had my first experience of workforce planning there were huge upheavals in the manufacturing industry, as big if not bigger than we're seeing now. We were losing whole industries and we were also automating very quickly indeed. So I think it's always been an uncertain business and it's just a question of getting your head round which uncertainties are important at your particular time, and in your particular organisation.\nPL: So are there lessons to be drawn from the blue collar sectors then if they've been grappling with these difficulties for longer?\nWH: I think manufacturing, given it's had such a very tough time, some of the organisations I look to who've been the most thoughtful about workforce planning have been in manufacturing, particularly for example in their redesign of work in thinking about multi-skilling, ways of building more flexibility into their workforce, not necessarily contractual flexibility but functional flexibility, the ability of people to do more than one thing. And I think we've got so dominated in recent years by what I would call contractual flexibility, outsourcing and gig working and all of those things, we've rather side-lined other ways of getting flexibility into the workforce.\nPL: That's an interesting point. Just to wrap this it seems to me the whole concept rests on fully understanding your organisation doesn't it? That must be your starting point.\nAW: Yes, I absolutely agree there. We're looking at the whole workforce, across functions, across global sites and getting to know the workforce as a whole, so that you can then become more agile and more flexible as change comes around.\nPL: Because this is very much about the trajectory of the business as well isn't it, in the sense that your business is not a static entity?\nWH: No and it's affected both by internal decisions and factors and by external.\nPL: Yes, we talked about Brexit obviously a big one.\nWH: Again that mental habit in workforce planning of always thinking both internally and externally. And I would start by talking to managers. I think there's this pressure on HR to start doing a lot of analysis. I think if you sit down with someone who's responsible for a unit or a division or an area or a particular group of people and say, 'What's it like now? How easy is it to resource this area of work? And what changes are coming up?' So doing it collaboratively that way with the managers initially, not seeing it as an HR thing, related to Ally's point about it being a business process, then I think you know what data you need to go and look at. I always let the issue or the problem guide me in searching for data, otherwise you go and flap about with data not knowing really what you're looking at.\nPL: So it's important to look at the whole workforce, and the analysis and review that Ally and Wendy were talking about will play into talent and succession planning and a focus on the key skills you'll want and where you'll need dedicated action plans. That process is going to involve many functions right across the business of course, including finance and planning, and Wendy's point about talking to line managers before you bury yourself in data was echoed by our final guest. Olly Britnell is Global Head of Analytics and HR strategy at Experian, that's an organisation employing 17,000 people and it's all about gathering and analysing data but he thinks the key to workforce planning is getting out and about right across the business and talking to colleagues about what they do and what they need. And when he joined Experian five years ago workforce planning was front and centre.\nOlly Britnell: Workforce planning was then flavour of the month but interestingly then subsided and went away.\nPL: Why do you think that was?\nOB: I think the business commitment wasn't there, so for me, workforce planning needs to have business commitment, it can't be an HR initiative. It has to be driven from senior business leaders around their commitment to it and having probably a slightly longer-term vision rather than a tactical short-term vision.\nPL: How long are we talking about?\nOB: Three, five years is probably the typical I would say for true strategic workforce planning, anything less than that I would class more as resource planning.\nPL: So before we get on to how it actually works at Experian do you want to give us an idea of how it would ideally look everywhere?\nOB: For me it very much starts with that business commitment in terms of business leaders articulating what's the vision for the organisation and recognising clearly that people are going to play a big component of that, even in an organisation such as Experian where technology plays a huge part in terms of what we do. The pace of change of technology at the moment is so quick that actually the skills we need to execute on that strategy are evolving at a similarly fast pace. So we need to be thinking much more longer term in terms of what does that look like. Also thinking more broader in terms of things like what does the workforce mix look like, so the flexibility of the workforce again is a common theme, and the gig economy in terms of contingent workers versus perm etc. And I guess finally, from a location strategy perspective, is probably the third component that I'll talk around in terms of being clear where do we want to move and grow our workforce as obviously there's a clearly a cost element to that in terms of offshoring and the like, but equally where are the skills that we need actually exist.\nPL: So when you put it in those terms it's a big project, it's a very broad project. How do you do it on the ground?\nOB: The reality is yeah the scale to do it truly globally I've yet to see properly executed. So the way certainly we've gone about it is a more piloted approach. So we've focused on actually a small number of key job families within the organisation that we believe are going to be critical. So it's probably only focusing on maybe a quarter or a third of our actual total workforce, but we've identified that those as the key ones for us to truly accelerate our growth and focus on where we want to be.\nPL: So taking your pilot model of doing a chunk of your workforce, or for a small organisation it may be the whole thing, what are the steps?\nOB: One of the first hurdles that typically falls down is no one believes the data to start with, going 'Well do we even have that many number of people in these critical job families to start with'. So getting credible with the data I would say is certainly the first step.\nPL: Is that really a problem?\nOB: There are a lot of organisations who can still barely count their headcount. I think linked very closely to that is the definition side, quite a dry subject but a critical one I think in terms of when we're talking around future skills and capabilities, are we truly clear on what we mean by that? Product development, that can mean lots of different things to lots of different people.\nPL: That's really interesting. So you need housekeeping, you need definitions across the board?\nOB: Yeah definitions in terms of the skills and capabilities and again the trick is from a current state to future state as well. So what's needed today isn't necessarily what's needed in the future. So having that definition of today versus tomorrow clear, what are the differences and again going back to business commitment of getting them to really sign up to them and commit to saying, well yes these are the skills that we do truly need.\nPL: But how do you identify those? I mean that's quickly said but it's complex isn't it?\nOB: It is yeah, lots of workshops, lots of discussions, and playing it through. So we run workshops with our senior leaders and team leaders around that topic basically of saying, 'Right product development what do you mean? What does it look like? What does a good one today look like versus what do we think it needs to look like moving forward?' And go through those kind of questions. So for me there's a lot of information gathering to start with to get your baseline view of what's actually required. And then you start to move on in terms of data capture clearly, in terms of right now we've got a clear view of what we're talking about how many are we actually going to need moving forward?\nPL: Is this really feasible for smaller organisations that don't have the sort of resources you have to call on?\nOB: I'd argue it's potentially easier to get your hands around.\nPL: Less complex.\nOB: Less complex. I think where Experian - from a workforce size perspective - isn't huge, 17,000 is obviously a big number but it's not as big as other global organisations. But we're very matrixed as a business and getting those definition up front is a tricky exercise. Whereas I think if there's a smaller, simplified model of an organisation, potentially it is easier to get your hands around it.\nPL: And putting your organisation under the microscope in that way must have other business wins as well because you really do get an accurate picture of who you've got, what they're doing and what you think they'll be doing in the future, don't you? That's useful in all sorts of ways presumably?\nOB: Definitely yeah. Off the exercise we've done relatively recently I guess it's provoked some great discussions at the very most senior level within the organisation, simply by being able to articulate this is what we anticipate the organisation to grow in five years with this mix of workforce in these locations. People have taken a bit of a step back and gone, whoa okay that is going to be quite a big challenge. We're talking about growing product developers by 25% and 50% growth in India, for example. Those are big numbers. So it's kicked off a huge amount of work in terms of hiring strategy and making sure we've got really clear plans around how are we actually going to tackle this from a hiring perspective. Equally from a retention perspective, we're utilising analytics in a detailed way. We've got predictive tools that look at retaining talent. And then from a learning and development perspective as well of saying how can we grow some of this talent internally.\nPL: So this is by no means a job just for data gathering analytics people or indeed just for core HR. If you're putting together a project team to think about this work who would you have on it?\nOB: You've got to have the business leaders involved as part of this exercise; Finance have got to join the party as well clearly because there's a cost implication around the changes that are taking place; the HR folk and business partners need to be driving the activity and asking the right questions around it as well.\nPL: So in terms of wins what are you seeing?\nOB: A far clearer strategy at an organisational level, in terms of what's important in terms of skills and capabilities over a three- to five-year timeframe. And then for the HR function I think it's given talent and talent acquisition, our recruiting teams and learning teams, something to really hang their strategy around. So because we've got some real numbers, we've got something really tangible that they can say from a hiring perspective, 'Well, in Costa Mesa in the US we need to hire 242 product developers over the next five years'. That's a challenge that they can really get their hands around and say, 'Well how are we going to really execute on that?' So I think it's helped us really frame our HR strategy in a more strategic way.\nPL: Well that's good news. Where's this going?\nOB: Where's it going? Who knows, it'll probably die a death in 18 months I reckon.\nPL: Let's hope not.\nOB: And the cycle will start all over again. But no, for me I think, organisations are recognising more broadly, or certainly with HR the use of data to drive decisions, it's not going away, it's not a fad, it's been talked about a lot for the last five, ten years as the next big thing. Luckily it's probably not now being talked about as the next big thing because it is now starting to embed and I think most organisations recognise that they need to have a handle on their people, HR data, in a more strategic way. It isn't a nice to have, it's a must have. CEOs, FDs are demanding better insight on their people data because they recognise the skills capabilities that are needed are probably not in existence currently and therefore how are we going to bridge some of those gaps?\nPL: Okay. So if you're keen to know where to start with workforce planning, here's Ally's advice. AW: We have a Brexit hub and also as part of that, CIPD in conjunction with IES produce a workforce planning guide for Brexit and actually a workforce planning practice guide, which is purely about the process of workforce planning in very simplistic terms. PL: So a great place to start. AW: Yes. PL: My thanks to Ally Weeks, Dr Wendy Hirsh and Olly Britnell. See you next time.

      "summary": "Corporate scandal often leads to talk of how we can shift business cultures to be more ethical. But is only culture to blame? And, what can organisations do on a day to day level to enable employees to act in an ethical way?\nIn this episode, we explore the how job design and management practices can drive ethical or unethical behaviour. We hear from Mel Green, Research Adviser at the CIPD, who shares the latest evidence from a review conducted by CIPD, the Center for Evidence-Based Management, and Australian National University on the risk factors for unethical behaviour. Kate Griffiths-Lambeth shares her experience of creating a ‘speaking out culture’ at Charles Stanley and Philippa Foster-Back, CBE, (Institute of Business Ethics) highlights the role that reward plays in business ethics.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:20:47\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: We all like to think we behave ethically at work but what does that really mean and does getting your job done sometimes mean you have to push ethical considerations aside. With trust in organisations and employers being eroded by one scandal after another a lot of good work is being done to build better values into business behaviour and we've been tracking that work here on the podcast series for the past four years.\nIn 2015 we looked at how to weave ethics into organisational culture. Two years later we dug into the work the CIPD was doing on ethical behaviour in leaders. Now there's new work from the CIPD on the role that line managers and job design both play in making business more ethical. The findings are worrying. About a third of HRs say they've seen unethical behaviour in managers and around the same number admit they can feel torn between how they'd like to behave and what their employer wants from them. So when it comes to ethics HR is right on the front line.\nMel Green: Yeah they are and I think we hear this a lot that there's potentially sometimes a disconnect between what the organisation wants and employees want. It's a difficult tension between the people and profit and I think HR are in the middle of that as the ethical conscience but also the link between management and employees too, so we know it can be a tricky balance to make.\nPL: And that means they witness unethical behaviour.\nKate Griffiths-Lambeth: I think if you work in HR it would be untrue if you said you'd never seen any because there are times when individuals feel either under pressure, or that they can get away with something, or that that's what's expected of them.\nPL: The first voice there was Mel Green, Research Adviser at the CIPD and author of the new report Rotten Apples, Bad Barrels and Sticky Situations. Next up was Kate Griffiths-Lambeth, a lawyer by training, her career has taken her from city trader to HR at a fintech startup to her current role as HRD at investment management firm Charles Stanley.\nKGL: I've seen some instances of inappropriate behaviour. To give you a personal example when I was on a trading floor I was specifically told to make sure I wore a short skirt and preferably a low blouse because X was coming in on Friday and he was an important client and I was the only girl.\nPL: And did you?\nKGL: No I didn't. I had a serious chat with whether they felt that that was appropriate but it was real Wolf of Wall Street time.\nPL: Any instances of things which people might not perceive as being directly unethical like perhaps a little bit of misrepresentation to a client, perhaps a little bit of not telling them the bits in the report that aren't bolstering your case but the fudging things around the edges and that's about culture isn't it, that what's deemed to be acceptable?\nKGL: It is about culture and it needs to become 'that's not the way we do things around here,' and just because the competition do doesn't mean we should because at the end of the day the good guys will win and the others will be exposed.\nPL: The bad apples report acknowledges that senior managers are more aware than ever of the need to create an ethical culture. The problem can be in filtering that thinking and behaviour down through the rest of the organisation. Philippa Foster Back is director of the Institute of Business Ethics.\nPhilippa Foster Back: I think it is, it's filtering down and it's filtering up because of course the new people entering the workforce have got very different views from those of us who have been around for a longer time but I think it is filtering through but unfortunately a lot of people have said that the middle area, the middle management, the permafrost, is stopping it filtering through. I don't think that is necessarily the case, I think they're not being helped to filter it through. So some of the work from the recent CIPD report does touch on this because it's how you set up the culture, the organisation, the target-setting etc. for that middle layer in order to be able to do their jobs in the right way, that is what makes the difference and that's what brings you back to culture.\nPL: The CIPD report looks specifically at the flashpoints in our working lives that can lead to unethical decisions and behaviours.\nMG: So we talk a lot about how culture and reform can impact ethics but what we really wanted to look at was at a more granular level how can organisations actually shift things in their business on a more day to day level?\nPL: And what's the scale of that problem now, do you have a sense of it across the board?\nMG: I think we know that it is an issue for business despite continued focus on it. So I think we know that trust is eroded in business, we know that, for example, people seem to give less to charities now, after the scandal in the charity sector there's been some research on that. But equally it's not the case that there's rotten apples everywhere, it's more about shifting businesses to be able to become more ethical and supporting their employees to do so I'd say rather than a large-scale disaster.\nPL: So looking at your new report you talk about rotten apples, bad barrels and sticky situations, do you want to just give us a bit of explanation on those?\nMG: Yes so we looked at a huge amount of research for this report because we wanted to give a really evidence-based look at the practices that organisations can engage with to enable their employees to be more ethical. And we identified three levels of that. So the rotten apples talked about the individual level risk factors, let's say, for unethical behaviour, so that's anything from personality to mood, all of those things play a role. Then the sticky situations are very much the day to day tasks and situations and decisions that employees have to make. Sometimes they can be sticky, something it can be difficult to act ethically because of the way jobs are designed, the way reward is designed for example. And lastly we can't forget the bad barrels, so the climate and the leadership in an organisation of course have a huge impact on how people behave and social norms are really powerful, we know that, so what the norm is can often guide behaviour.\nPL: It's clear that ethical codes and policies alone just don't bridge those chasms between values and actions. Ethical issues arise even in systems where good checks and balances are in place.\nMG: Codes of ethics and codes of conduct are a really good signpost and I think we know that they're effective but they're effective when they're actually used - they can't be an empty shell policy where there's a code of conduct but let's say a high performer does something slightly unethical and they get away with it. So it's really about fairly applying those policies and embedding them into everything that the organisation does for them to really have teeth.\nPL: And training isn't the whole answer either. Here's Kate Griffiths-Lambeth again.\nKGL: When the Weinstein case was coming out I pointed out that in California it's compulsory to have sexual harassment and discrimination training. It didn't seem to make a blind bit of difference to be quite honest. It isn't the training that makes the difference, it's the culture. It's having an environment where people feel trusted; feel that it's safe to speak out, where from the top downwards it is exemplified by the leadership and therefore people, that's what they will emulate, it's what they will copy. There are things that you can do to help, for example you can draft aspects into people's job description so it's spelt out in black and white.\nPL: And there's a real danger too in writing the ethical policy and thinking, job done.\nPFB: You tick all the boxes and you think once you've done it, oh good that's done and put it away in the bottom drawer. That's a very dangerous way to react because if you think about it every time you hire a new person into the organisation their journey with the organisation starts, they need to know how they should be behaving in this organisation not how perhaps they were doing it before and bringing it, so they need help. They need guidance. It needs induction. So more effort perhaps needs to be made continuously, a sort of drip feed for people just to not lose sight that this is the right way to behave, or behave sounds you're on the naughty step, but the right way to undertake business in order to demonstrate to your customers that you are a trustworthy business to deal with.\nPL: So in terms of line managers and promoting ethical behaviour in just day to day tasks, the day to day jobs that we all do when we go to work, where are the flashpoints where unethical behaviour tends to creep in, in your experience?\nPFB: I would suggest that most people don't wish to do any unethical behaviour, they get drawn into it and sometimes just by cutting a corner and not realising that they have, and once you cut a corner it's very difficult to make it a right angle again. So I think that's one of the aspects. I think it's where they context of their role comes. If they are set unattainable targets which they know are unattainable, probably their boss knows is unattainable but hasn't got the courage to push back from what they've been told to do, you get this well of feeling and almost immediate stress, being given something you know you can't achieve yet you know you have to if you want to keep your job, that is extremely stressful and I'm sure a lot of mental health issues are being caused by this. People just need to be more realistic and more honest actually.\nPL: And of course reward is often linked to those short-term targets isn't it, so it's a really tangible problem.\nPFB: It is particularly if you're paid on a commission basis.\nPL: Yeah, which so many people are, particularly in financial services, but even at a lower level, not just Wall Street traders but ordinary people.\nPFB: Absolutely the pressure to be salesperson of the month.\nPL: Yeah because that's how success is defined in the organisation.\nPFB: Yes and that is where the organisation needs to reflect is this the best way to reflect success? Should this be the only way?\nPL: At Charles Stanley they're already trying to measure performance and behaviours differently.\nKGL: Well we split it into three, so you've got individuals who need to improve; we've got individuals who are perfectly good and acceptable and then we have the exceptional role models. We've made it very clear in training that not everybody is a role model and you have to be able to evidence what it is that puts you into that bracket and there is a premium as far as discretionary bonuses are concerned for individuals who are role models and achieve their objectives. So there's a financial driver in there; there's a slight kudos driver in there because people know that you've got the badge and others haven't; but it also has meant that we can show to people what good ethical conduct looks like. And people are talking about it.\nPL: Are they, I was going to say. So what are you seeing as a consequence of introducing this?\nKGL: Sometimes people are using it as a way of calling out saying well nobody will think you're role model if you behave like that.\nPL: Interesting.\nKGL: Other individuals actually have brought people to attention saying, look what this person's done, they've gone the extra mile for a client who's blind and because of that they are a role model to us, we want them on your radar.'\nPL: So ethics and behaviours are becoming more part of the day to day conversation?\nKGL: Yes.\nPL: And then there's job design, here's Mel Green.\nMG: The way that work is organised is quite important so as I've mentioned earlier there are few people who are inherently rotten apples but there are things in the way that we work that can make it difficult to behave ethically. So one interesting finding was that when jobs are quite monotonous more unethical behaviour can occur. And that might seem slightly counterintuitive because you might think you have more time to think about your decisions but actually what the research suggests is that when you're doing quite a monotonous role sometimes you go on autopilot. So you're not engaging with the potential ethical outcomes of your behaviour. So that's something that organisations can think about, and managers can too, when you're thinking about things like work pressure, how much variety people have, it's all part of having a good job really but there's particularly ethical lenses through which we can think about those things.\nPL: The CIPD research suggests that monotony leads to autopilot and high pressure leads to short cuts and they both end up as unethical flashpoints.\nPFB: I think that is a concern. I remember years ago when I was a student working in a factory, doing a very monotonous job and I know my brain switched off at one point and then of course everything went wrong, which was a rude awakening.\nPL: No future in that line of work.\nPFB: No future in that line of work, but it was one of the few times in my life to actually stand and do a really monotonous job and you realise that there are an awful lot of pitfalls that can happen around it. What I didn't have, because it was only going to be for two or three weeks, was I hadn't developed a pride in the job. So I think even if you're doing a monotonous job as some of us would see it but you actually have pride in your work and what you turn out that changes the nature of the job. And I think where employers can help people in those sorts of jobs is actually develop some semblance of how they can have pride in it by what they achieve and so they can see where they are with the cog in the wheel.\nPL: So it's back to culture.\nPFB: It's back to culture.\nPL: Now earlier we mentioned that ethical flashpoint that can happen when people are too distant from the consequences of their actions.\nMG: So there's some really interesting findings around if an employee is far removed from the end-user, or they won't see the outcome of their actions, thinking about the longer-term impact of their decision isn't going to be forefront of their mind. So that gives a really nice practical way for organisations to think about bringing ethics to the forefront.\nPL: Or if they feel they might get away with it.\nMG: Yes exactly, accountability is important.\nPL: Philippa Foster Back agrees. So job design needs to take that into account?\nPFB: It does need to take that into account and it needs to take into account how the organisation wants decisions to be made. So one of the things we have seen, and we promote ourselves, is for organisations to have decision-making models which are used in the boardroom down to the front desk. So that people understand that the first question is how would this decision fit with our values, is actually a very important one to consider and then various other questions. And then the final question is, is it legal? Because we have seen models where it starts with is it legal? And people think oh well of course it is, I'm sure it is, no perfectly all right! And they never get to the second question.\nPL: And all that brings us to whistle blowers. Now it goes without saying that ethical organisations need clear channels for their people to report issues or concerns but that is not enough.\nPFB: Whistleblowing is a very negative term and if you go back to the original antecedents if you like, in the days of mining when people were down the pits if something went wrong, what did they do? They blew the whistle to bring people to the mine head and usually it was an accident sadly. The referee blows the whistle after the event, doesn't blow it in anticipation of an event. So we're talking about something having happened. Now actually what organisations want is to know in advance of something that could happen, something that might be wrong, somebody's seen something, something doesn't look right, somebody's behaviour, some process.\nPL: And how do you make that safe for people to come forward with that sort of information?\nPFB: Well you start off by talking about speaking up, feeling free to raise a concern. You then have a very well thought-through process to help people. Instead of having a lawyer drafting your policy you have a speak out policy and you write it from the point of view of somebody who's going to want to use it.\nPL: And first and foremost how you brand it, you don't call it whistleblowing, you call it speaking up or speaking out or your views, or whatever it is, so you take the anxiety out of it?\nPFB: That's right you take that term away. And even now, there used to be and it is changing when somebody did speak up they were called the whistle blower, now they tend to be called the reporter.\nPL: Right.\nPFB: So again trying to take away that frightening language of being a snitch.\nPL: So you're doing a constructive thing rather than criticising the organisation.\nPFB: Exactly yeah it's a positive.\nPL: At Charles Stanley they've already taken this on board. Here's Kate Griffiths-Lambeth.\nKGL: So we refer to it as a speaking out culture.\nPL: You do?\nKGL: Actually I've been involved in a culture sprint with the FCA, which is our regulator, and they gave us six different scenarios and one of the ones that we had was linked to people being comfortable speaking out but also the fact that frequently in an environment where you've got people of different levels, a junior person may not want to speak out in front of somebody senior in case it sheds them in a bad light. So we've actually got little tents that we put on meeting tables now to remind the senior people to let the junior people speak up first rather than speaking over them and putting all their ideas on the table and people then feeling frightened to raise something in case it's seen as conflict or contradicting.\nPL: Interesting and is that working well?\nKGL: We are still in the testing the concept phase because I promised the FCA so we've got trial runs in which we do it at meetings and trial meetings in which we don't. But actually the outcome is very positive so far and people are reporting a change in behaviour just by having the subliminal reminder there. So there's lots of things that you can do to help communicate and get messages across.\nPL: And it sounds like you're on a journey, you're doing a lot.\nKGL: We're trying. I'm sure there's an awful lot more we can do and I'm always open to ideas from other people. I think the CIPD's got a pretty good network that does tap into each other and talk. So suggestions please bring them my way and if I can give ideas to others I'm more than happy to do so.\nPL: Yeah because HR is right on the front line isn't it?\nKGL: Yes it is. I think there is not a more exciting time to be in HR because we are absolutely there and helping drive the agenda and helping influence thinking and making the workplace the kind of workplace people want to be in and where they can thrive and hence their organisations thrive.\nPL: And here's the last word from Mel Green.\nMG: There's not a silver bullet to eradicate unethical behaviour but there are tools and things that businesses can do in their day to day operations that can actually make a shift and that's really important. So if you want to hear more about the research and our findings you can go to the CIPD website where you can find the report.\nPL: As Mel says the report is on the website and to share your ideas about creating and sustaining ethical behaviour at work with Kate and indeed everyone else, join the Twitter conversation using the hashtag CIPD podcasts.\nNext month it's workforce planning, why it's vital and why it's not as difficult as you might be thinking.

      "description": "Episode 147: We explore the effects the menopause can have on many women's experience at work and what employers can do to ease their transition.",
      "summary": "Women over the age of 50 are the fastest growing segment of the workforce, and most will go through the menopause transition during their working lives. For every 10 women experiencing menopausal symptoms, six say it has a negative impact on their work. Yet it remains a taboo topic in many workplaces. Women will continue to suffer in silence unless we break the stigma and start talking openly about the menopause at work.\nIn this episode, Deborah Garlick, from Henpicked: Menopause in the Workplace and the CIPD’s Senior Employment Relations Adviser, Rachel Suff share their ideas and insights. We also hear from Janet Trowse at Network Rail who has first-hand experience of working within an organisation that does all it can to support menopausal women in the workplace.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:20:22\nTranscript\nDeborah Garlick: I'm Deborah Garlick from Henpicked: Menopause in the workplace.\nPhilippa Lamb: Deborah is the founder of a website called Henpicked. It's for women aged over 40 and three years ago a TV network got in touch with her and asked if she knew of any organisations with a menopause policy.\nDG: it was a bit of an interesting question for me, I'd never seen one and as I'd not seen one I didn't think anybody else would either. So I got in touch with a lot of the HR directors that I know and said, 'Do you have a menopause policy?' and it was a resounding, 'No we don't,' but there were a few of the HR directors that came back and said, 'But if you've got one I'd like to have a look at it.'\nPL: It's fascinating isn't it that not a single HR you spoke to had a policy or had even really thought about it. And having researched it myself it is just I think the first area I've ever come across where no one is talking about it, not even women are talking about it. Why do you think that is?\nDG: It's a complete mystery isn't it because we haven't invented this; menopause has always been around for as long as there have been women there's been menopause. But what is very different Philippa is that there are more women in the workplace than ever before. Menopausal women are the fastest growing workforce demographic and of course we're working for later. So once upon a time, you know, when early retirement was on the radar maybe some women could just think, well I'll get through this I'm going to be retiring in a couple of years. But with menopause average age being around about 51 and women working until their late 60s menopause can be a real bump in the road and something that can completely derail some women's career, their work, it's an absolute mystery. But when you say lack of awareness, this isn't just lack of awareness in the workplace it's generally, it's UK-wide. A lot of people will say, well men don't know a lot about menopause but we actually say neither do women.\nPL: So give us a bit of a primer Deborah. I mean as you say it's not a thing people know about it's not a thing even women know about, what sort of symptoms are we talking about? What sort of timeframe are we talking about?\nDG: Timeframe-wise I think that's one of the biggest misunderstandings. We have women and a woman said to me earlier on this week, 'I don't think it can be menopause because I'm not 50 yet.' And certainly when we start talking to organisations the conversation is often, 'Well we don't have many women in their 60s and 50s working for us.' So that is a good place to start. The average age for menopause is 51 but symptoms start years before that in the 40s and that's for women that go through menopause at the average age. There are so many women that go through menopause early, naturally, or as a result of surgery or illnesses like cancer, cancer treatments can cause menopausal symptoms. So timeframe-wise we have to adjust our own mindsets. But you mentioned symptoms now we all recognise hot flushes. It's the stereotypical menopausal symptom but some work we did last year around about 5,400 people filled in the survey and what was very clear is it's not always the physical symptoms. Actually it was the psychological symptoms that were getting in the way most. So what was on that list it was insomnia, fatigue, anxiousness, nervousness, problems with recall. Often women feel that they're - I'll say falling to bits. We hear women saying, 'I thought I'd got early onset dementia.'\nPL: As Deborah says it's not uncommon to go and get tested for early onset dementia when in fact they had menopausal symptoms. And it's not just men who don't know about the symptoms, it's all of us. Deborah's other revelation about menopausal women being the fastest growing sector of the workforce is vitally important too.\nRachel Suff: I'm Rachel Suff and I work in the Public Policy team at the CIPD and I lead on health and well-being issues.\nPL: Rachel has been instrumental in the CIPD's new work on menopause. So tell me in a business context from an employer's point of view why does menopause matter?\nRS: It matters because if you think about the age range that people are affected by the menopause, that's about 45 to 55, nearly four million women are in that age group over 50 in work and nearly every one of us will experience the menopause. Around 80% of those women will experience symptoms so it is a really significant health issue. So if you're serious as an employer about attracting and maintaining women, your female talent, you have to take the menopause seriously as a health issue.\nPL: This is a highly personal matter for women, perhaps even more intimate than pregnancy or fertility treatment for example, they probably won't want to discuss it at work but some will find they just have to because their symptoms are so hard to manage. So the task for employers is to create a culture where everyone knows about menopause and can have those conversations if they need to or want to.\nRS: I think you're right and I think some of the symptoms can be quite intimate. It can feel quite personal. So for example things like hot flushes, heavy bleeding, you know, we have to talk about these things quite openly and I think the key to it at work is just trying to open up the conversation and I think the less embarrassed you are as a manager for example in that organisation the less embarrassed women will be to raise the issue and I think the responsibility is on the organisation to try and create that open environment. You'll find that it can happen quite quickly that opening up of the culture. We talk about it much more now in our own organisation at the CIPD.\nPL: Do you?\nRS: Much more openly and it's really made a big difference and if you think about it even young men may come up against this issue because they might have a mother who's going through the menopause and some men in the organisation have been really pleased to have the chance to talk about it. The menopause I realised that until I started working on this project I don't think I'd really had a conversation about the menopause and now I've had lots and lots and lots and that can create a really positive knock on effect.\nPL: I'm just so intrigued by this because every woman we speak to about this says exactly the same thing and no one is ever talking about the menopause, it's the greatest taboo isn't it?\nRS: It is.\nPL: And I think in researching this programme has made us really this is the greatest workplace taboo we've ever encountered.\nRS: And I think a lot of people the trouble is they don't even realise it is a taboo because it's so buried and not even talked about. And I think that makes a lot of people in organisations think, well I shouldn't talk about it, maybe it's not appropriate for me to actually mention the menopause, am I putting my foot in it?\nPL: Yeah.\nRS: I was shocked to realise there are about at least, oh 40 different symptoms you can have. Everyone's going to experience them in a different way probably. They're going to fluctuate. So what you need from your employer can change over time as well. You need to have that ongoing conversation with your manager.\nPL: And the timeframe can really vary, we talk about average age 45 to 55, quite a lot of women much earlier, quite a lot of women much later, but generally we can be talking about, I think it's an average of about seven, eight years of symptoms isn't it, it's a long time.\nRS: Yes and I hadn't realised that as well before I really started looking at this as part of the project and it was an eye-opener for me as well, I thought it was something that maybe lasted a couple of years, you came through the other end, that's not necessarily the case!\nPL: Disappointing for all women.\nRS: The symptoms, I'm sorry to tell you, can go on for many years and we have the post-menopausal situation. We have the perimenopause, before the menopause and that can last for several years when your hormones are starting to change. Then we have the menopause itself and then afterwards as well you might still have some of these symptoms. So it's a very personal issue as far as how far your symptoms are going to affect you and for how long.\nPL: There's another side to this and that's stigma. In the past menopausal women have been acutely stigmatised and at work that can potentially lead to a whole range of negative or outright illegal discriminatory behaviours. Deborah Garlick?\nDG: Absolutely stigma. I think that one's evident that how many women don't talk to their line manager about menopause.\nPL: Or indeed each other.\nDG: Or indeed each other, yes, and that is something that's UK wide, that's not just something that happens in the organisation. And when you think the perception, we mentioned it earlier, about menopausal age, and certainly one of the graduates that we started working with his first question was, 'Aren't all menopausal women retired?' So that shows what they think.\nPL: Right, disappointing.\nDG: I know yeah, whether all menopausal women are so much older than people think so why would a woman put her hand up and say, 'Actually I'm menopausal,' when there's this perception that it's so much older.\nPL: Okay. For organisations, yes we need to get on to this, it's crazy not to on all sorts of levels. What is the starting point?\nRS: First of all trying to open up the culture so people can talk about it openly, therefore women don't feel embarrassed about going and having a conversation with their manager about some tweaks and changes they might want to their working day, but I think as well look at what your framework is, do you have any support that could be helpful, because it's a health issue just like any other health issue it should be treated as such. So do you have things available like counselling and so on? But then I think it's looking at issues like sickness absence, you might need to take a bit more short-term absence, if you've had terrible nights for example. So it's being flexible around hours of work. And then I think definitely training and educating line managers. They need to be knowledgeable so they're not embarrassed when somebody comes to talk to them.\nPL: Yes, you don't want any squirm factor do you in those conversations?\nRS: No. You need to talk about the symptoms. You need to understand what the symptoms are.\nPL: And here's an organisation that's trying to address menopause head on, Network Rail has 4,000 women on the payroll, some work in office roles, others are out and about in railway maintenance, engineering and construction roles. Janet Trowse is head of HR system operator.\nJanet Trowse: So we started in 2017, not so long ago but we were doing it as a passion it has to be said and in truth my colleague and I started from the point of personal experience of menopause. We also recognised that something needed to be done as we talked with colleagues it's quite evident that it is a challenging thing to be talking about any sensitive subject, whether it's mental health, any diversity challenge, but menopause in particular is a word...\nPL: It's the big one.\nJT: ...that's not said out loud.\nPL: So when you started chatting with women about it did it quickly become apparent that there were problems, they were experiencing difficulties and they wished that stuff would be done for them?\nJT: Absolutely.\nPL: So how did you start that process then? How did you put the word out that this was something that you wanted to see discussed?\nJT: We started by structuring up terms of reference, going really bog standard, so we treated it as a proper project and not as a personal campaign. I think with a subject area such as menopause it's really important to not make it too personal, so if you're engaging the finance directors or very senior people it's being able to talk about it in a people context but importantly in a business context.\nPL: It was an educative process for everyone in the organisation regardless of gender and simply having the conversation helped a lot of women who had been suffering in silence.\nJT: I think it's really comforting when you talk to people and they may have experienced similar type symptoms. That in itself normalises what people are going through. So I'll give you an example, for me personally and for many women I know that we can become quite forgetful. We can start to lose our confidence a little bit because we start to make it to be a bigger thing than it actually is.\nPL: This reassurance and comfort that women feel by coming together and talking about their experience of menopause at work has produced some innovative ideas such as menopause cafes. Here's Deborah Garlick again.\nDG: Menopause cafes in organisations or outside have been something that some organisations have adopted because that brings women together to talk about it and just being able to talk about it is good for you, you know. That was some work that was done at Kings College in London that talking about menopause is actually a way of relieving menopause. It might sound a bit strange for some people, but if you're bottling it up and not talking about it, or actually we hear a lot from women that it's reassuring that they're not alone.\nPL: At Network Rail Janet has done a lot of thinking about the problems that her menopausal colleagues were having and what she could usefully do to make life better for them at work.\nJT: There are so many things that you can do within an office or an external environment to think about temperature control, clothing, hours, I mean never before has flexible working been so important I think in the workplace.\nPL: And this is around insomnia, is that what's driving that?\nJT: Yes. So I know of a colleague who sleeps so badly that she probably falls asleep at four or five in the morning so to get up at seven is just not on and why would any employer try and hold her to that because it becomes unsafe, not just for her but for the people around her.\nPL: Or just making poor decisions.\nJT: Absolutely.\nPL: Whatever your job.\nJT: Whatever your job.\nPL: There are big wins for employers here in reputation, recruitment and retention, to name just three a menopause-friendly organisation is going to surprise and appeal to women jobseekers and of course it's a great way to push inclusivity into new territory.\nDG: This ticks all of the boxes for HR, diversity and inclusion, equality, health and safety; you're looking at potentially reducing absence. Now I don't necessarily like to associate menopause with absence but we know a lot of women don't know they're experiencing menopause, they don't feel great but they can't put their finger on what it is. And so raising that awareness, we've only got verbatim statistics at the moment but it does appear to be a tick in the box for absence.\nPL: And just thinking about the sort of adjustments that employers might want to think about in this context we're not general talking about complex things are we?\nDG: No we're not talking about complex things and I think that's something that we find interesting when we're training line managers because when they see the big numbers and they start to understand the context you can sometimes see line managers thinking, crikey what have I got to do with all of this?\nPL: Yes to make this work.\nDG: How am I going to run my team if we're going to have this, or how is this going to work? But actually it's often the small things that make a world of difference for a short period of time while a woman gets that support and learns how to manage her symptoms. It's not forever.\nPL: Network Rail has deliberately made its menopause policy publicly available.\nJT: Our information, and I've purposely done this with menopause, is we've put it onto our Safety Central site, which is accessible externally as well as internally which means that we can engage with our suppliers and contractors, anybody we deal with, and actually if you want to you can look at that information.\nPL: So a member of the public can go on that site?\nJT: Correct yes. And I think that's really important.\nPL: And then there's retention and this is a huge issue around menopause. Here's Deborah.\nDG: There is research that says one in four women considers leaving work as a result of their experience around menopause.\nPL: Yeah I've seen data that says 10% of women stop work due to difficulties around menopausal symptoms which struck me as a very big number indeed.\nDG: It really is a big number, 10% leaving and the big number of one in four women considering it, now when you think of business case, and we know from Oxford Economics, it costs around about PS30,000 to replace a colleague on an average salary of around about PS25,000. That's not just the recruitment process, that's the induction, the bringing them up to speed, and you don't have to avoid many women leaving the organisation for this to be a significant payoff.\nPL: And we should say of course and everybody will understand this, there are legal obligations here too, workplace conditions, you cannot exacerbate someone's medical symptoms, discrimination, so issues around training, advancement, career progression, all those questions get wrapped into this don't they because of people's perceptions about what it means when a woman is menopausal.\nRS: Yeah and again I don't think a lot of employers realise that there is a really strong compliance case to take the menopause seriously. We have had case law at tribunal where somebody's symptoms are so severe that it's considered a disability. There's also the whole body of health and safety legislation, you have to assess, as an employer, the risks to people's health and that includes looking at factors in the workplace that could exacerbate somebody's symptoms. So there's a very hard-edged business case supporting this too.\nPL: So do you think we'll see more of that because obviously more women are working longer, there are more women in the workplace who are going to be menopausal and the call for appropriate adjustments and just for the workplace to be more menopause friendly they're going to be louder aren't they?\nRS: I think you're right because with more awareness as well you could have more complaints being brought because a lot of women themselves might not be fully aware of the implications of what their menopausal symptoms might mean at work.\nPL: And the rights they have.\nRS: And the rights they have. So with more awareness we'll bring more awareness about people's regulatory position and their ability to bring a claim and I think once you've had successful claims at tribunal and they've been around sex discrimination and around disability discrimination already that's already put a precedent on the statute books.\nPL: This may very well be the first discussion you've ever heard about the menopause at work but I think we can say with confidence it won't be the last.

      "summary": "Flexible working includes various working arrangements such as part-time, flexi-time, compressed hours and working from home to name but a few. With UK Prime Minister Theresa May's support, the Flexible Working Taskforce was established to widen the availability and take-up of flexible working and is chaired by the CIPD. In this episode we’ll explore the work of the Taskforce and the CIPD's investigations into flexible working including design, availability, visibility and productivity. We capture ideas and insights from Peter Cheese and Claire McCartney from the CIPD, Kamal Shergill, Dan Kieran, Christine Armstrong, and Margaret Heffernan.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:20:43\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: Flexible working is hard to define. Flexi-time, part-time, home working, they're all part of it and there are of course many other ways to work that don't involve a 9-5 workday. Prime Minister, Theresa May, is a fan, last year she told employers she wanted to see all jobs advertised as flexible from day one unless there were solid business reasons not to. That led to a new flexible working Taskforce and not a moment too soon as in January this year the charity Carers UK published a startling claim that over 600 people leave their jobs every day because of the demands of being a carer. But most employers still think there are barriers to flexible working, even if there are benefits too and culture and resistance from management are common blockers, alongside workers' worries about career progression and of course pay.\nCIPD Chief Executive Peter Cheese is co-chairing that new Taskforce, here he is explaining what he hopes to achieve.\nPeter Cheese: So the remit of the flexible Taskforce is to review all of the thinking and practice and principles and down to potential policy of flexible working.\nPL: So who's involved?\nPC: First of all it's co-chaired by me as Chief Executive of the CIPD with BEIS, so the senior civil servant in the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy. We have most other major government departments involved, so DWP, Treasury, the Government Equalities Office, groups like that, and we have the TUC, the CBI, ACAS.\nPL: So it's up and running isn't it, has anything happened so far?\nPC: Yes it's been up and running for about six months now and the way we've approached it is to think about an employment lifecycle, all the way from recruitment and through retention and so forth. So one of the first things we did was to promote flexible working at the point of recruitment, and so Working Families, which is also on the Taskforce, had come up with a hashtag of #happy to talk flexible working. Then we said, let's promote that through all of our channels and say to organisations, 'Put that hashtag onto all of your job recruitment adverts which we're seeing quite a lot of uptake on already.\nPL: What's happening next?\nPC: So next we're into big, and where it does start to get really interesting I suppose in many ways, a debate about these different forms of flexible working. So once somebody's come in okay what are the forms of flexible working? Of course it ranges from a discussion on hours, short contracted hours, compressed hours. It can of course be reflected in terms of location, where I work, but it also can be reflected in who is doing the job. So are we job sharing? We haven't made a lot of progress on flexible working in recent years, in fact the reason for the setup of the Taskforce is the national data from ONS shows that flexible working has plateaued even since the time of the Right to Request. So we said, all right let's start almost on the other end of the spectrum which is well why wouldn't flexible working be the norm?\nPL: The CIPD is soon to publish its own investigation into flexible working and Claire McCartney, who's diversity and inclusion adviser at CIPD is here to dig into the findings with Kamal Shergill who's people services manager at the construction company United Living. Thanks for coming in. So Claire, I think it's 2014 isn't it since we all had the right to ask employers for flexibility.\nClaire McCartney: That's right.\nPL: How many people are actually doing it do we know?\nCM: Well we've recently released some Megatrends research which actually says that the number of people taking out the formal right to request has actually plateaued in the last ten years, so I think what we're seeing actually is a reduction in those taking it up formally but more people doing so informally, which is creating its own dynamics actually in organisations.\nPL: And do we know who is most likely to ask for it?\nCM: Well I think probably from a formal perspective it's more likely to be those that are thinking about returning to work or have particular responsibilities, so they need that formally.\nPL: So women mostly?\nCM: Potentially women or carers, but what we're also seeing is that actually more people than ever want flexibility.\nPL: And age-wise, I mean obviously it's across the board but there's quite a lot of young and there's quite a lot of older aren't there?\nCM: Yeah absolutely. I mean we know from time-wise research that 87% actually want to work flexibly but only 11% at the moment of organisations offer quality flexible roles.\nPL: It's a huge gap that isn't it. I mean Kamal I know your company has made flexibility a priority why did you do that?\nKamal Shergill: I think for us the recruitment market is pretty tight, we're competing with a lot of other companies for the best calibre staff, so for us to get the best candidates we wanted to offer it and open it up. But not only in terms of recruitment it was also important for us in terms of retention. So it's sometimes the one think that will keep a fantastic member of staff for us.\nPL: And when did you start this focus on flex?\nKS: It's been about a year or so in terms of development so the process has been that we've set up a steering group which has champions from across the business and we've got executive buy-in to it and we do regular communications so that everybody knows what's going on and we've got a clear process in place for measurement of impact as well.\nPL: So how can we make flexible work more widely available? Well the CIPD and Jericho Chambers are currently working on a project called The Future of Work is Human. At one of their events we put that question to three experts: authors, Dan Kieran and Christine Armstrong, and the event chair, fellow author and expert on organisation culture and leadership, Margaret Heffernan. Here's Christine sharing her thoughts on the need for more flexibility.\nChristine Armstrong: So the structure of the way that we work no longer works because we have modelled an environment where we expect broadly there to be a dad, male breadwinner, out working 9-5 with a partner, wife at home taking care of the house, the children, the parents and anything else. And we've added into that always on, so instead of working 9-5 we're working from when we go to sleep and we've also added an expectation that both or all members, or adult members of the household will work and that's the way that our mortgages and rent are structured and the way that we make our lives sustainable. So for me flexible work is a really, really important part of the question but really what I worry about or think about a lot is how do we create boundaries around work? Actually I think what we need to think about are lots of different ways for us to be able to focus on work when we're working and then be able to walk away from work when we're not and too often when we talk about flexibility or I interview people who have flexible work they say, 'Well I get paid for a three day week but of course I work five,' and that's not the kind of flexibility we need.\nPL: And here's Margaret talking about the barriers.\nMargaret Heffernan: Well one of the barriers to flexible working of course is bosses' mythology or fantasy about how unproductive they are, how it's really skiving off, how if they can't see you you're probably not working. I think that is a huge barrier. I can only imagine it's one of the implicit reasons, so they may not talk about it, why Facebook won't let people do it. There are also barriers about confidentiality, security, that kind of thing but I think in my own experience of running companies what people routinely find is that when they decide they're going to spend a day at home to work, the work they've taken home which they know would take them a whole day to do in the office generally gets done at lunchtime. I do think however it is really important that people do have time together and what we know is that one reason to have organisations is because you get a huge benefit of collective intelligence when people come together, swap ideas, challenge each other and I think this idea which some people have had which is well everybody can work from home and we never have to get together, I think it may be cheap but I don't think it's efficient or productive.\nPL: So they're interesting points certainly and I'm wondering if you think is Christine right about this point, I've heard it often said flexible working often involves more hours than you're actually paid for?\nCM: I think so. I mean I think that's probably one of the things that we need to tackle and what the Taskforce also focusing on is job design and making sure that when we are offering a flexible role or in some ways reduced hours that it's actually not just the full-time role repackaged as a part-time role.\nPL: What about the barriers that Margaret was talking about, this perception that workers if they're not under a manager's eye they're not working, I mean there's very little evidence for that is there?`\nKS: I think it is a real challenge for all employers in terms of how we're dealing with it. We have set some very clear measurements of the impact of flexible working as part of our pilot so that we can try and measure productivity which is challenging and at the end of the pilots the plan is to look at the impact - has it made a difference, have people delivered on time, and to budget, particularly for example at our construction sites.\nPL: Because that's the thing isn't it, it is about outputs and approaching it from the other end is a difficulty a lot of organisations have because they're not really grasping that.\nKS: Yes, and for us that's why we've got these measures in place because we can then demonstrate the impact and it becomes harder to challenge flexibility if you can deliver the outputs.\nPL: That brings us to buy-in from line managers and overcoming resistance.\nCM: Yes and I think genuinely there will be a resistance because some line managers will think there's a lot of work involved here in terms of scheduling but actually what we need to do is make sure there is senior support so that then line managers feel that they have permission to be flexible with their teams and we've got senior role models. We talked about leaving loudly if they've got a flexible pattern so that people know that that's part of the culture. And then those line managers that are doing it well become attractors of talent.\nKS: I'd concur with that, in terms of leaving loudly is an ethos that we're trying to build with our senior managers and it's getting a lot more buy-in because if it's okay for a senior manager to leave at a particular time then it's okay for their team to leave as well. So it really sets a good example to others.\nPL: Yes and that's an interesting point and Margaret Heffernan had something to say about the productivity piece as well. Let's hear that.\nMH: I think organisations can overcome the barriers to remote working partly by asking people what they think would make them more productive. I think also one of the things we know about productivity is that human productivity really taps out at about 40 hours a week. We've known this since 1888 when the first productivity experiments were done. We've been doing experiments ever since, the numbers hardly change. So actually there's a limit to the number of really good working hours in a working week and I think once you make it really clear that you're talking about productivity in terms of output not input then a lot of the resistant to remote working falls away.\nPL: And Kamal, I could see you nodding when she was talking about asking people what makes them more productive, is that something you've done?\nKS: Yes as part of our flexible working pilots we've engaged our teams, so we've got eight pilots across the business and what we've encouraged is informal flexible working because we wanted that freedom of expression and it's been important for all the teams to get together and decide amongst themselves what they feel would make them more productive and the potential impact on other members of the team and how that could work. So it wasn't necessarily management saying this is what the solution is.\nPL: That is really interesting tell us a bit more about what sort of solutions they've come up with and have they all come up with the same solutions?\nKS: No we've had very varied solutions. So for some it's about working compressed hours, five days into four. For other's it's about staggered hours so it gives them flexibility, so for example to come in early, leave early, which means that potentially they can pick up their kids at the back end of the day and the other half picks them up at the beginning of the day. For others it's about having a Wednesday afternoon off because they want to go and play golf. So what was really important for us was that it's not designed for a particular group of people it was open to absolutely everybody.\nPL: That is a really interesting way of doing it isn't it?\nCM: And also quite brave as well. I think it's great actually asking individuals and empowering them to make that decision themselves and then they take ownership for it.\nPL: And did they struggle? I mean how big are the teams?\nKS: So they vary, some range from 15; some are smaller teams, back office, front office. I think if I'm honest it was a struggle in terms of getting their heads round it particularly from a site perspective because it's not a way that we've necessarily worked, although there has been some informal flexibility to be fair. But I think the fact that everybody's come together and has come to a joint solution with it has got that buy-in.\nPL: And you did get a sense that it was joint, it wasn't the most senior people in the room saying, well actually this is what's going to work for me?\nKS: No absolutely not, it was definitely a consensus in terms of what would work for everybody and how as a business our priority is to deliver a fantastic service to our clients and to get a work/life balance whilst we do it. I think in terms of Margaret's point on you can't be based at home all the time, so we've got a mixed bag. We've got some people working at home some days but then we've also got team meetings that are set in place so that everybody does come together to share learning.\nPL: A good idea this point that people do need to come together you think?\nCM: I think so. And I think from the case studies that we've been looking at building up those relationships initially face to face is really helpful and then that allows you to be more virtual, allows you to be more flexible but you do need to have some kind of element of face to face to build up that kind of relationship.\nPL: And as you've both said it's about trust isn't it? I think Dan Kieran had a point to make about flexible working being an expression of trust.\nDan Kieran: For me flexible working is incredibly important for a company because at its heart is an expression of trust for your workforce and people who are trusted perform better for you and I think it's one of the things that employers struggle with because they have quite an old fashioned mindset around work where they pay for their employee's time and therefore they want to be able to see and monitor that they're getting good value. I had a conversation in the pub with some of the staff actually quite recently and one of them said when they first found out they were like, this guy's a pushover I can totally take the piss, and they sort of did for the first few weeks but then they were like, actually I really value that I'm allowed to do this and what they've realised is they get more work done.\nPL: So that does speak to the point you were making doesn't it Kamal about the idea that there's trust but there's buy-in and so they kind of get the sense it's more about the team supporting each other.\nKS: Very much so.\nCM: And two-way flexibility as well so I think the trust it's not just one-way it has to work both ways so I as an organisation am affording you to work in this flexible way and we want you to be flexible in return when you can be, and building up that type of relationship I think is really important.\nKS: You're turning it into an adult/adult relationship effectively, there's a give and take in the equation isn't there?\nCM: Yeah that's right.\nPL: And it kind of flattens out the management structure in a way doesn't it?\nKS: Very much so.\nPL: Because everyone really has an equal say in how the structure works and making it work in practice because you can't have some of the team members as we heard in the clip, taking the mick, because everyone is co-dependent.\nCM: Yeah they'll be held accountable won't they really by their team members and they'll want to make it work I think is another point really.\nKS: There's a real incentive to making it work. Although that said when we've run our pilots not everybody wants to work in a flexible way, some people are happy to work the core hours, and that's fine too.\nPL: So of course demographics are key here, the share of total employment accounted for by people aged over 50 is set to rise, as we know, in fact it's going up to 35% over the next three years so that means by 2032 a tenth of the workforce could be aged over 65. So what sort of flexible work will these older workers want? Here's Christine Armstrong.\nCA: I think we have to look at this subject in the context of 100 year life and this idea that people will work frantically in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s for 60 or 70 hours a week in some cases, in professional jobs, is bananas. It's unsustainable; we see the mental health problems that come with it. We see the breakdowns. We see the people leaving employment and deciding they're going to hand-print wallpaper somewhere in Scotland. What I would like us to think about is a long-term approach to different phases of our career where you can scale up and scale down according to your needs as an individual, according to your family needs and your caring needs but with an underlying focus on being more productive.\nPL: It's interesting isn't it this whole idea about age and we hear a lot about millennials and what they want in terms of flex and I think that's been well discussed hasn't it but this thought about older workers perhaps with caring responsibilities, perhaps just wanting phased retirement, perhaps just needing to work because they can't afford to retire, that's a whole chunk of the workforce that are really going to be focused on flex aren't they?\nCM: Yes definitely. And research that we've done before at the CIPD shows that organisations aren't offering enough flexibility for that kind of cohort and we're talking about flexibility across the board but a lot of older workers will want phased retirement. They might want to retire and then return. So I think it's an area that organisations really need to focus on going forward.\nPL: We hear a lot about the four-day week, obviously other countries have adopted it in a big way; it's much discussed over here, well here's Dan giving us his thoughts on it.\nDK: I'm really excited by the four-day week. Just to give you an example the people I hire they're the best in their field at what they do. They're hard to get. For people like that in five, ten years' time the way you'll get them is by offering them four days a week not five. Paying for five but getting them four days a week because they'll do more in four days than five.\nPL: And obviously we've been talking about a whole variety of forms of flex and it comes in many shapes and sizes but four-day week do you see that becoming more of a norm? It's becoming much more popular in countries like Japan isn't it? I think it's quite widespread in Holland, in Germany, is it just a lazy way of thinking about flex or is it the way forward?\nKS: I think it's the way forward. We've had a lot of interest in terms of a four-day week, a compressed week and the fact that so many people are interested in it is giving us a very clear signal. A lot of our employees want to have a longer weekend and therefore if people have those extra three days instead of two days they're then more committed to the role and we get more out of them from a business perspective, better engagement, better messages about the business to the wider world as well. So I think it will drive improvement in terms of performance and productivity.\nPL: Yet you don't see a loss there on the business front?\nKS: I don't think so. Data so far suggests that it's a win.\nPL: I mean thinking about, we've alluded to recruitment, we've talked about retention, the labour market is tight, we're recording this ahead of Brexit but the Office of Budget Responsibility seems pretty certain we're going to look at a tight labour market regardless of how that plays out is flexibility going to be a key issue in terms of recruiting going forward?\nKS: Definitely without a shadow of a doubt. It's the USP that sets different companies apart from others. It's an exciting time for our industry, if we can offer flexibility we'll be able to attract the best candidates. So for example as part of our pilots what we've said to the pilot teams is if we've got any recruitment within those teams the default position is the role will be advertised as flexible.\nPL: Needless to say you can find a huge amount of information and research about flexible working on the CIPD website, including that Megatrends report that we talked about earlier.\nJoin us again next month.

      "description": "Episode 145: We tackle how to handle harassment and the complex issue of NDAs",
      "summary": "The past few years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of high profile bullying and harassment claims across industries and sectors, from daily newspapers and multinational corporations to government bodies. With scrutiny high and both employees and consumers demanding more transparent practice, it is essential that HR teams have appropriate policies, processes and practices in place. In this episode we talk to Julie Dennis at ACAS about how you can best handle harassment claims, and to the CIPD's Head of Public Policy Ben Willmott about the future of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).",
      "full_text": "For the CIPD's latest thinking on the use of NDAs you can refer to our viewpoint.\nDuration: 00:18:59\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: If there's one workplace issue that's hit the front pages more than any other in the last 8 months it's probably harassment. At a recent CIPD conference we asked delegates if they had stories to tell.\nTell me have you ever experienced bullying or harassment at work?\nFemale: In the hospitality industry, I used to be a waitress, so maybe a little bit of harassment from the male chef towards women.\nMale: Not personally no.\nFemale: Yes, yes I've experienced it myself and also I've seen it happen to another HR colleague.\nMales: I have and it's difficult sometimes because you feel very secluded, you've got no one to talk to.\nFemale: I've heard some horrific stories.\nPL: Have you, what sort of things?\nFemale: Interestingly in my experience it's mainly staff using procedures and policies such as grievance procedures to bully managers.\nPL: Really now that's a thing you don't hear much about.\nFemale: Absolutely.\nMale: Yes I did.\nPL: In what way? My first boss was very authoritarian, ruled by fear and that resulted in about eight or nine of his staff leaving in a very short period of time.\nPL: How did the organisation help or did they help?\nMale: No they didn't. They moved him sideways to a different department.\nPL: Do you feel if you search your conscience that you might ever have yourself made someone feel bullied or harassed?\nMale: That's a good question. Not knowingly but I might have done.\nFemale: Myself I haven't ever.\nPL: It's hard to know where the boundaries are sometimes isn't it?\nMale: Absolutely it is and I think sometimes you ask expectations of people that maybe you think you could do yourself but then they say, 'I haven't got the skills or capabilities for doing that,' and sometimes you maybe do step beyond where you should be in trying to get them to achieve what you want to do.\nPL: The conciliation service ACAS provides free and impartial information and advice to employers and employees on all aspects of the workplace including harassment.\nJulie Dennis: So I'm Julie Dennis and I'm the head of diversity and inclusion at ACAS.\nPL: There are various challenges for HR here but perhaps the biggest is to create a culture where people feel they can come forward to tell HR or a line manager what's going on. But how should HR do that? JD: There's a variety of ways that organisations can. I think the first steps that we would encourage from ACAS is having a policy in place that clearly sets out to all of your people - this is how we expect you to behave at work. And if people do not behave in that way or you feel that your colleagues are not living up to that behaviour these are the steps you can take to raise a complaint, be that informally or formally. But I think there's a bit of caution that comes along with having a policy, a lot of organisations think that having a policy that's it, that's job done and actually a policy is only any good if you're making people aware of it. So having adequate training in place.\nPL: And obviously as you say having a policy is one thing, organisations acting on their policy is another and many seem to have found it difficult to do so when it comes down to it. I wanted to ask you about transparency because obviously organisations, Google and the rest, have been criticised for dealing with these issues behind closed doors, there's a case for openness in the sense that other people may be encouraged to come forward; if disputes and complaints are talked about and discussed; there's an issue of fairness around do you want to talk about these things until there's evidence, how can organisations deal with that issue of how transparent to be when a complaint comes forward?\nJD: Transparency I think is a really difficult one. I think we've all seen in the press people who've been accused of improper behaviour, have had trial by the media and we've seen that sometimes that's been a positive thing because it has made people come forward and speak out but on some occasions it's been a very negative thing where people have been subjected to false allegations and have their careers left in tatters.\nPL: So what should the policy be? What should organisations do?\nJD: We would advise that you should investigate, take all complaints seriously and investigate those, depending on the seriousness. Yes try and do what the complainant would like you to do. Ask them first of all what steps would you like us to take but obviously there may be occasions where actually as an organisation you may say, 'I understand you don't want us to take this any further but actually because of the seriousness of those allegations we have a duty of care to you and we need to investigate that. But whilst we investigate that we will look after you. We'll point you in the direction of support services, counselling etc.' But good employers should also put that provision in place for the people who are accused of harassment and bullying because again it's an allegation to begin with. So that person may not have done that or actually may not be aware that their behaviour is not acceptable. Most people that we deal with in ACAS when they're actually confronted about their behaviour they're normally mortified that what they've done has had such an impact on somebody and the first thing they want to do is just say sorry and for some situations that's enough, just for someone to say sorry. It's only when we've got really serious stuff that actually then we need to investigate that properly.\nPL: Do you think most organisation actually have appropriately trained people to undertake the sort of investigations you're talking about because it's no one's day job is it and yet these are terribly sensitive and terribly important to the people involved?\nJD: So there are some organisations out there where actually it is people's day jobs, I know of some big employers out there...\nPL: But for most it's not.\nJD: ...for most of us it isn't and it's about actually equipping all managers to have those people skills on how to deal with investigations and having good guidance and policies in place. It's also for HR professionals to support those managers that are undertaking investigations and be there throughout that process and let managers know that support is available because you could go on a training course but then not have to do an investigation for a number of years.\nPL: So that's a little bit about the kind of role of HR professional in these situations, what about the role of line managers?\nJD: I think in terms of line managers they need to again investigate any complaint promptly and quickly and take it seriously. Employees don't normally raise complaints if something's not happened. Very few people that like to cause a bit of trouble because someone's upset them. Also managers need to undertake that investigation and be independent so if they're not the right person to do that investigation - they may be the deciding manager on a grievance case - they may want to appoint somebody else to undertake that investigation.\nPL: And what about responses to cases where it evidently is the case that something has happened that shouldn't have happened, how should organisations respond? Is there a case for leniency? Should it be zero tolerance? What should it be?JD: We would always promote zero tolerance. Legislation makes it very clear, especially if we are looking at cases that are in breach of the Equality Act for example, so we know that there are protected characteristics where it is a breach of the Equality Act, so you are leaving yourself exposed to further legal action if you don't deal with those cases.\nPL: And more and more sectors are coming under scrutiny here aren't they - science and medicine? Particularly at the moment in the last few months we've seen a lot of stories in the news about that, how do you see this playing out? I suppose the #Me Too movement obviously has put some energy behind it but it was coming before, where's it going?\nJD: I think we're seeing a sea of change happening. I've been working as a D&I professional for nearly 20 years and I think it feels different this time. I think as a society we're starting to see that if we stand up and speak out then we can stop this behaviour.\nPL: Non-disclosure agreements are a big issue in this debate, when we raised them with delegates at the CIPD conference one woman told us about her own experience.\nFemale: I left my last place of employment and was bullied quite significantly there by my line manager. With the support of my union rep I managed to negotiate a package which meant we didn't have to go to court but I settled with them out of court.\nPL: Interesting, did they make you sign a non-disclosure agreement?\nFemale: Yes they did, yes.\nPL: What do you think about that?\nFemale: I think it's appalling, really I was treated really appallingly but at the time I was in a difficult situation personally, I was going through a divorce and I didn't have the time, energy or finances to take time off work and fight them so I just took what they offered me and signed the non-disclosure agreement and left.\nPL: That's not an unusual story and last year Prime Minister, Theresa May, said it was clear some employers were using NDAs unethically. Then in November the Women and Equalities Select Committee launched an enquiry into the use of NDAs in discrimination cases. For Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the CIPD, the run up to Christmas suddenly became very busy indeed.\nBen Willmott: The Women and Equalities Select Committee launched a call for evidence around the use of NDAs in relation to harassment and discrimination cases in the workplace.\nPL: So CIPD jumped into action, pulled together practitioners and lawyers, expert members, and gathered up some views and handed them over to the Select Committee. What questions are the Committee asking or interrogating?\nBW: Well the three main areas they were interested in were firstly should NDAs be banned for this type of use? Secondly if they were banned what impact would that have on individuals who might have relied on those types of agreements? And thirdly if you don't ban NDAs then what safeguards can you put on their use to make sure that they are used in a way that benefits victims or people who are being falsely accused for example. Our approach was to conduct a series of telephone interviews with some of our senior members working across different organisations and so members of the Public Policy Team conducted those interviews and together that helped bring our evidence-base together.\nPL: And lawyers too?\nBW: We had I think two or three employment lawyers who are CIPD members who fed into that process as well.\nPL: So they all stepped up just before Christmas and gave you their opinion?\nBW: Absolutely and I think this again highlights how important member engagement is for CIPD in terms of influencing the public policy debate. The sorts of insights that these senior practitioners give to policymakers is gold dust and so we're incredibly grateful to any of our members who give their time to provide that sort of insight for us.\nPL: But there was a lot of disagreement about NDAs.\nBW: Yes so we had a split and we had probably a slight majority who are in favour of the responsible use of NDAs when use is part of a settlement or compromise agreement when someone is exiting the business.\nPL: What do they see as the pros?\nBW: Well I think the pros, particularly in relation to issues around sexual harassment or discrimination that quite often it's one person's word against another and so these individuals quite often are quite nervous or scared of having their version of events forensically taken apart, particularly if they go to court when there is no objective evidence for them to refer to so it literally is one person's word against another.\nPL: A real ordeal.\nBW: Yeah absolutely. And so I think in those circumstances the feeling was that if people who are victims or that the evidence in the round suggests that their version is one that does carry a very persuasive weight behind it then for them being able to have some acknowledgement that they have been treated poorly, to have some financial compensation and being able to leave the organisation and move on, is the right thing for them.\nPL: And presumably they also take the view that some of these victims just won't come forward and won't stay the course if they feel they have to be publicly questioned about it and so perpetrators will actually get off scot free.\nBW: Well and that was exactly the other point that actually by seeking to do the ethical thing by banning NDAs you're actually doing the opposite of what you want, you're actually stopping people from having a legitimate exit and ability to have some form of recompense and acknowledgement and leave these issues behind them. And so actually that might mean we have more hidden issues around sexual harassment, bullying or discrimination in the workplace. So that was definitely one perspective. The other perspective is practitioners, you've got some practitioners said in 30 years of working in different organisations I've never seen the use of a NDA in a way that has benefited the victim or the alleged victim. PL: Right because there certainly are some strong voices that think it should be zero tolerance, that they should be banned.\nBW: Yeah absolutely and I mean I suppose from a really hard ethical perspective you could see the logic behind that but I think the reality of the workplace is sometimes quite messy and I think that we need to make sure that we don't ultimately disadvantage victims. Another perspective came out was that NDAs can also be useful for individuals who are subject to false allegations in this area as well.\nPL: Yes when we talked to ACAS they highlighted that issue too that the other side of these disagreements or disputes is not to be forgotten.\nBW: No absolutely.\nPL: And that people who have been accused of these behaviours need to be thought of too.\nBW: And so we really do have some quite conflicting views on this.\nPL: The debate about the use of NDAs looks set to be a fierce one, Ben Willmott and his team fed back that wide range of views about how they might be changed, regulated or even scrapped to the Women and Equalities Committee. That was before Christmas, now they're busy preparing for the next stage. So we're recording this in January, what's happening next is that you're pulling together a roundtable of experts to sit down in a room and chew this over.\nYeah I really want to understand how we can reconcile these polarised opinions, what is the correct balance, and understand what the CIPD perspective on this really should be. We will be giving evidence to the Women and Equalities Select Committee at the beginning of March so we're making sure that we've got that new data to make sure that when we go in front of the committee we do have a very solid line on this.\nPL: We don't know what the future of NDAs will be yet but right now if there is an NDA one thing is clear HR still has a vital role to play.\nJD: I think what's gone wrong with NDAs is that those organisations think that once they've signed that, that's job done, instead of actually then having a conversation with that individual and making it clear that their behaviour's not acceptable, because they've done an NDA so obviously there's something they're not wanting to get out. So actually I think HR have a really clear role, do they put that person on training, do they give them some awareness or do they start having those conversations around actually you do need to modify your behaviour because this cannot carry on, regardless of how good you are in this organisation.\nPL: Yes or how valuable because obviously it tends to be more senior people that these NDAs are written around.\nJD: But it can be quite a difficult conversation and I recognise that there are HR professionals out there, especially in smaller organisations where that would be a very difficult conversation to have. So although the textbook answer or in the real world is try and tackle it, it's also very difficult for some of our colleagues out there to deal with that.\nPL: This debate is everywhere now so have we reached a tipping point?\nBW: I think the debate is really healthy. I think because it really does get to grips with the reality of these sorts of very, very difficult issues around the employment relationship, harassment, bullying and discrimination in the workplace, particularly when it's one person's word against the other, and so I think it's really useful for employers, HR practitioners, to understand what does good look like in this area? What are the areas that they need to be wary of? And that's why CIPD is going to be producing its updated guidance around these sorts of issues to provide a bit more clarity on what is good practice.\nPL: That's all for this month but needless to say we'll be watching this one closely so listen out for updates as that consultation moves forward. You can see the CIPD's submission to the Women and Equalities Select Committee on the CIPD site. Next month we'll be looking at the future of flexible working. Who will be asking for it and what will it look like?

      "description": "Episode 144: We explore trust and human connection in today's workplaces",
      "summary": "In today’s business landscape, as new scandals occur with increasing regularity, the concepts of trust and reputation are growing ever greater in importance. Organisations are finding that they must be more transparent and accountable to engage and retain their customers and to attract the best talent. Building trust both outside and within an organisation is now essential to business success.\nIn this first episode of 2019, we explore trust and human connection in today’s workplaces. What benefits can pursuing them bring to a company and what challenges do they present? What role do people professionals play in developing this culture and embedding it throughout their own organisations? And how can they model these behaviours in their own day-to-day work?",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:21:09\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: Hello and welcome back to the CIPD podcast. Last year was another year of corporate scandals: Google, Facebook, Volkswagen, now with failures like those fresh in all our minds we're going to start 2019 by talking about trust. What does trust bring to an organisation? How does human connection fit in and where in that landscape does HR sit?\nWe chose four experts to interrogate those questions, our first lectures at Oxford University's Said Business School and she's the author of a great work called 'Who Can We Trust?' here's Rachel Botsman.\nRachel Botsman: Often I go into organisations and they're talking a lot about trust and one of the first things I ask them is well what is it? And it's really interesting because, this is a generalisation but when you're talking to marketing communications, even HR they tend to describe it as an attribute. So the number of organisations that have trust as a value is astonishing to me. So they'll have like curiosity and innovation and trust, which is really strange because I don't know what to do with trust as a value. And then if you talk to other parts of the organisation often leadership teams, compliance, legal, they will talk about trust as an asset - something that they actually want measured and valued. And it's not that I don't think trust isn't either one of those things it's that you can't achieve trust in an organisation if you think of trust in that way. So the way you have to think of trust is it's a human feeling and it's a continuous process and it's something that is given to you, it's something that you have to earn.\nPL: With tech reaching into all areas of our home and work lives organisations want our trust but they want to win it easily and they want to win it fast and that says Rachel just doesn't work.\nRB: Yeah the way I think of it efficiency's the enemy of trust. So think of your own life trust actually needs time. It needs continuing investment and effort and it needs friction. Trust is actually built in those moments where you're not sure of that other person, you navigate through and one of the watch-outs in organisations is this idea that we can automate trust, that we can use technology to speed people through that process and you see it a lot with apps. And the mistake is that you have their trust where you don't, you just have convenience. So this is a challenge in terms of deciding where for example bots can play a role and what we can automate and then fundamentally what really needs to stay human because I believe the businesses that will win in the future will be the ones that use technology to become the most human and they are the ones that we will trust.\nPL: But if speed and tech don't build real trust what does?\nRB: It's small interactions and actions over time that build trust. For example Brene Brown talks about the Marble Jar; you know where do you fill up the marble jar. I like this term the trust battery that Tobi the CEO of Shopify really codified in this idea that actions and interactions and conversations and whether we do what we say we're going to do and whether we show up on time, they're recharging or decharging the battery.\nPL: So the consequence of this diminishing trust battery what does it mean for organisations?\nRB: Low trust teams and cultures tend to be; I'd go so far as, very unhealthy places to work. It's pretty easy now to walk in and actually spot a low trust team and very few organisations are low trust across the board. You'll often find pockets where the battery is really, really charged, but the signs are they are very uncomfortable with risk taking. They are really uncomfortable with not knowing the outcomes of things, so they tend to be very prescriptive and quite linear, so they have to know where everything is leading. They tend to have a lot of people in meetings, high email culture, very extensive briefs and presentations. And so it becomes paralysing.\nPL: If Rachel's description of low trust organisations sounds a bit familiar it's worth remembering that trust isn't just nice to have it's vital.\nRB: There is a really tight link between low trust cultures and cultures that struggle to innovate. You can walk into a high trust team and one of the most common characteristics is the leader of that team doesn't know where it's going to end. They have faith in the process, they have faith in their people, they give them a lot of autonomy around risk taking. I think vulnerability is another sign of a high trust team. So leaders often say, particularly male leaders, like I really want my team to trust me more ((laughs)).\nPL: Make it happen.\nRB: Yeah make it happen. And it's often not a competence question it's because they are very uncomfortable with showing vulnerability.\nPL: Of course smart leaders know that inspiring trust really matters and we've all seen leaders conveniently produce some little piece of information about themselves that neatly demonstrates how vulnerable they are. Little do they know just how good most of us are at spotting that sort of manoeuvre.\nRB: We're unbelievably good at picking up signals. We're unbelievably good at picking up trust signals we've tried to fabricate. So there's nothing worse when the CEO tries to do the really authentic, vulnerable speech, where you just know it's not really them. So authenticity I think is a really tricky word for many people, like show up and be your authentic self. But I find when you talk to people, when you talk about integrity and you talk about benevolence so how do you show up and genuinely care about people. How do you show up and show empathy. How do you show up and continually demonstrate that you're interest and motives towards me are aligned with my interest and motives? That's easier for people to do than this pressure of being our authentic selves at work and so I think there's something really powerful in the language of trustworthiness that actually leads to healthier teams.\nPL: The trust relationship with a new employer has its origins long before your first day on the job it starts with the employer brand and how they recruit, but how often do their values and the actual experience of working there match what they said on their website? That mismatch interests our next expert, psychologist John Amaechi. His expertise is all about performance and his interest began in his early years as a professional athlete in the US where he became the first Brit to play in America's NBA League.\nJohn Amaechi: My name is John Amaechi; I'm an organisational psychologist, also recently a Chartered Fellow of CIPD.\nPL: This phrase aligning personal or business values, we hear it a lot, what do you actually mean by it?\nJA: I think businesses should have values that speak to both the excellence that they plan to practise externally and with stakeholders and internally with their own people and necessarily those values will attract people who should be aligned, not just to the commercial possibilities of that organisation but the experience that they are bound by those values to deliver. Part of what I think is important for workplaces is to create an environment that is so psychologically safe that you can challenge people to the ultimate level knowing that the environment is actually safe for them to experiment, deliver, fail and then succeed finally with the support that you offer them.\nPL: You say knowing, I mean that's where the issue lies doesn't it, that is a trust contract because you don't know do you, when you go and work for an organisation, you look at the website, you meet some people, you do some interviews, all organisations present an appropriate face to the world of potential recruits now, you don't know what the experience of working there will be like and it's often quite a mismatch.\nJA: So I mean I think firstly what we should do is probably reframe that. What we're saying is that organisations lie. That's actually what we're saying - organisations lie in order to create a brand. It's like people who airbrush photographs to make people who are already thin and beautiful into unobtainably thin and beautiful. And in some cases people who aren't beautiful into people who are beautiful...\nPL: Indeed!\nJA: ...in this corporate analogy.\nPL: Sure.\nJA: So they lie and then people come and become instantly disenfranchised and leave and then we call the people who leave 'snowflakes' we call them, 'entitled', we call them all the things that we call millennials and Gen Zs.\nPL: Yeah I suppose organisations might say well the deal is we pay so that's our side of the contract.\nJA: In that case if that was the contract tell the truth and pay but they don't do that because they know in order to attract the talent they need they'd have to pay ten times more if they told the truth. And that is a terrible indictment!\nPL: So in terms of productivity and sustainability and all the things we know about that lie, in your terms, is a foolish lie because it doesn't even work commercially let alone on other bases. Who should then be within these organisations the guardian of better behaviour? Is it HR? Is it the board? They have conflicting requirements, where does it live?\nJA: Well I think HR has a unique role in that now they are, more often than not, called the 'people' function; they are the 'people' people. But it's not just their responsibility there should be a cascade effect in an organisation so yes you have to have congruent behaviours and the right rhetoric at the top level. And then underneath you need to find people and there are tons of people who want to be custodians of that culture. They want to be the people who are charged, in a nonofficial capacity, right, so this is not about giving them elevated roles or elevated salaries, giving them this responsibility, you're keen on this? Yes. Be a vanguard in this organisation. You work on our front desk in reception, you clean our floors, you're a first time manager, you're just a colleague who's really interested. Yes, you disseminate this. Yes, you remind people these are the values and the behaviours that go along with them. That's not a difficult thing. It's exactly the kind of purpose the Gen Zs and millennials we are working with are asking for.\nPL: You say it's not a difficult thing but organisations find it difficult to do don't they? I can think of a number, particularly in the tech and social media space organisations who literally launch their brand off those values and that way of working and who are now, it's being revealed, excusing behaviour on the part of senior and valued individuals that is not at all aligned to those values. So the theory's great, the practical reality is tough for organisations to do isn't it, they're not excusing it but they're not doing it. Why aren't they doing it?\nJA: Because it's easier not to and we don't call them on it enough. If there are no consequences for bad behaviour why would you spend the energy to be behaved well?\nPL: I mean obviously there are consequences if it's illegal behaviour.\nJA: But there's not. Amazon has got workers who live in their car in the car park at their warehouse. It's not conjecture but we still get Amazon packages. There's no consequence.\nPL: So to build a genuine and sustainable trust contract in those relationships what needs to happen on all sides? Because you say we don't call organisations out on it, we as employees, we as consumers...\nJA: Stakeholders.\nPL: ...stakeholders.\nJA: What we can do is we can values based hire people so we know that these values are something that's important to them. Yes, but that they are empowered to enforce.\nPL: Shami Chakrabarti is a household name. She's Shadow Attorney General and a member of the House of Lords. She's a barrister and for over a decade she headed Liberty, the advocacy group which promotes civil liberties and human rights. She talked to me about social media and data tracking and how invasive employers should be.\nShami Chakrabarti: I think this whole question of employee data and digital presence is a very sensitive one and I think the answer needs to evolve. As so often with technology it moves apace and the ethics, the politics, the law, all that stuff of human relationships lags behind. And I think there are some really, really difficult questions about what the reasonable expectation is. For example, everyone is a broadcaster now. Everyone who tweets or otherwise uses social media is interacting, not just with their friends, colleagues and relatives but with the world. Now what does that mean for the balance between the reputation of the employer organisation and the social needs and expectations of the employee? There isn't a bright line here. There isn't a straightforward answer. It's obviously going to vary according to the organisation, according to the role, according to perhaps the seniority of the person in that role. It's so common these days to see, for example, senior BBC journalists tweeting with that famous caveat that these are their own views and not those of the organisation. But does that work in practice? And how would it work if a senior diplomat or civil servant or, dare I say it, judge, was tweeting or otherwise using a very public social media platform in their personal capacity? Is there such a thing as a personal capacity, as opposed to a public face? And what does that mean for employee and employer?\nPL: It's a vital debate isn't it because it's about trust isn't it, in employers, in employees, in organisations, in the people who run organisations, government, in every area of our interaction now trust is becoming a thing. It's a commodity for organisations and it all rests on this doesn't it?\nSC: I think that data is a commodity, trust is priceless. The problem is whose trust? And sometimes you're protecting and trying to earn the trust of one constituency at the expense of another. So for example when you're recruiting you might think that it's just common, reasonable practice in the 21st century to have a look at the digital footprint of applicants for a job.\nPL: And it's commonly done.\nSC: Commonly done, not illegal, not unethical, people are putting this stuff in the public domain, but, but, but, how does your workforce feel if they think you might be putting them under overly intrusive scrutiny?\nPL: Snooping.\nSC: Snooping on them. Can you snoop on someone even in a public place? Well of course you can. You can snoop on someone by following them around the street and you can do the same even with their digital footprint. So there's got to be some negotiated balance if you're not to make your workforce feel mistrusted and therefore not trusting in you.\nPL: So you've articulated the problem what needs to happen?\nSC: I think more conversation and I think that means conversations within society and the democratic space but also in particular organisations because I think to some extent these accommodations will be and ought to be bespoke, depending on the nature of the work.\nPL: This trust contract between employers and their people is being discussed everywhere, which expectations and behaviours are ethical and acceptable and which aren't. Dan Schawbel is a New York Times best-selling author and research director at Future Workplace. He believes that re-establishing that trust isn't just a matter for organisations; it's an issue for entire nations.\nDan Shawbel: France has the right disconnect so you can't email a worker in off hours. Daimler, the car company in Germany, has mail on holiday, so if you email a worker when they're on vacation your email is automatically deleted. The same with Volkswagen and Arianna Huffington's Thrive Global they've followed suit on that. And what I think even countries are doing is trying to provide a little bit more protection for workers, especially countries with strong labour unions like in Germany they're fighting for a 28 hour work week, in Japan you get Monday mornings off because workers who are overworked end up burning out and that becomes counterproductive and leads to higher turnover.\nPL: Do you think it also sends a trust message to the employees on the receiving end of the emails that don't arrive now that it is about we do care about you?\nDS: Yeah I think that people want to be treated as people first, workers second. We spend over a third of our lives working and especially in America where I'm based the average worker works 47 hours a week, here it's over 50 hours a week. Not having your phones is the new vacation and because we're constantly being connected and respond to emails outside of office hours and on vacations we need some give rather than just take.\nPL: It sounds like change is coming doesn't it?

      "summary": "The world of business is becoming increasingly complex and as a result businesses themselves are adding complexity to their structures, processes and systems. This can often act as a blocker to the factors of business success like innovation, engagement and ultimately productivity. So how do businesses and their people stay agile in a complicated environment?\nMany organisations have taken inspiration from the world of tech and increasingly people professionals are using techniques such as agile working, sprints, and scrum or squad working to achieve their goals and complete projects. But is it for everyone?\nIn this episode we talk to three HR and L&D specialists about what it means for an organisation to be ‘agile’ in today’s business world. We discuss the increasing complexity of business structures and look at simple steps for empowering employees to work collaboratively.",

      "description": "Episode 142: Finding balance in an age of digital transformation",
      "summary": "Robots aren’t taking over our jobs just yet, but automation is already augmenting many roles. Much of the current discussion on how new technology stands to change the world of work is limited. Debates typically centre on the extent to which humans are going to be ‘replaced’ or which jobs or tasks are most at risk of automation. This narrative is driven by the assumption that all we care about is productivity and since machines are seen to be much more efficient with the potential to make better decisions than humans – it can only lead to one conclusion. But in a world that is more connected than ever before – individuals are increasingly feeling isolated and desire human interaction.\nThis episode explores how people and technologies can augment each other in the workplace, through a series of case studies, providing important food for thought for both organisations and individuals.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:21:09\nTranscript\nGwion Kennard: Well I'm Gwion Kennard I'm the digital director for infrastructure and engineering.\nPhilippa Lamb: Gwion is with Atkins the global engineering company.\nGK: I've been a director within Atkins for the past five years leading the digital transformation within a small team of around 250 within networks and drainage.\nPL: Digital transformation, it's a phrase we're hearing a lot and the definition keeps getting broader. Now part of Gwion's job is to explore automation, robotics and mechanisation at Atkins and as he told me the opportunities to mechanise tasks that were traditionally done by humans are many and varied.\nGK: Oh they're vast, absolutely, and it permeates everything that we do, all of the human interactions and interfaces but actually there's a lot of tasks that we have now started to automate and build that into daily routines.\nPL: What sort of things?\nGK: So we were doing some analysis on an airport site where we were looking at a range of different scenarios of different aircraft movement and the fire risk associated with the loading and with the human movement around that site and traditionally we were doing that, writing a report about it, looking at three or four scenarios, doing some modelling associated with that, having some conversations with the operations team, pulling some data back associated with that and then writing a report feeding that back. And that was taking around a three to four week iteration.\nPL: And now?\nGK: Well and now, well because we're able to pull the data on the fly and we can run the simulations in the cloud automatically, and we can print the results back into the client database automatically, something that was taking three weeks now takes three hours.\nPL: Wow! So AI and tech are already having a big impact on our working lives and their economic impact is on the rise too. Professional services giant PWC predicts that AI alone could boost UK GDP by 10% by 2030. Now that growth may generate more jobs but AI and tech could also replace jobs that exist now.\nJonny Gifford: My name's Jonny Gifford, I am the senior adviser for organisational behaviour at the CIPD.\nPL: But you already know that because Jonny is an old friend of the podcast and he's often shared his research findings with us in the past. This time he's leading the CIPD research into automation in the workplace and a new report called The Impact of Emerging Technologies on Work.\nJG: There's no doubt that automation is a key part to the future of work. It's something which has the power to make massive changes in how we work, a huge number of cognitive and physical tasks can now be automated and the number's growing.\nThe problem is that it's often difficult to tell what's going on because the debate is very polarised. And you've got these two overly narrow positions: you've got the doom-mongers who say that robots are going to take over and we'll have poor quality jobs and mass unemployment and then you've got the utopians who say that we're all going to be freed up to write poetry in the afternoon, realise maybe the 15 hour working week that Keynes so famously predicted.\nAnd there's some research which points to a large number of jobs being made redundant, for example being computerised, but when we look at tasks within jobs the number seems to fall dramatically and looking at tasks seems to be one of the keys to how we should look at this because it's not jobs which are automated it's tasks within jobs that are automated and for the most part jobs will be augmented by technology.\nPL: Tasks, as Jonny says that is the key word here because when you listen to those doom-mongers he talked about much of their anxiety focuses on whole jobs disappearing to AI and robotics. That is already happening but much more commonly it's parts of jobs that will be eaten up by tech. now sitting next to Jonny we also had Jennifer Cable. She's a talent management consultant at PA Consulting, CIPD's partners on the research.\nNow you've worked together on this big piece of research, you've talked in depth to three organisations about how they've been implementing AI, how it's been received by their people, what did you find from that?\nJennifer Cable: Well one of the interesting things that comes out of the research is that perhaps employees, you see those same two groupings: the doom-mongerers [sic] and the people who are very optimistic and what we're seeing in that is while those are the people you hear about in the press actually there's a much wider variation of passion and response from those who are involved in AI. And in fact quite a significant proportion of people are really excited and have found that there have been benefits, it really has liberated and created great opportunity.\nThere are of course others that perhaps haven't had such a great experience with AI but that range of experience, we've got the doom-mongerers [sic] and the scare stories kind of persistent in the media and we see that in a same employee real lived experience of AI both positive and negative but a huge range of things in between.\nPL: Overall based on the research Jennifer paints an encouraging picture of the impact that tech augmentation is having on people but it is clear that if human reactions to tech aren't factored in overall performance can suffer; people become less motivated; there's less helpful human/computer interaction. And overall the organisation becomes less sustainable. So let's get back to Atkins what does Gwion think that all their new tech means for the employees who used to do their jobs in different ways?\nGK: Essentially what that does it takes time out of existing tasks. Now what that's enabling us to do is to use that time to actually think more creatively, more laterally, more holistically, about the problems, so the real client problems and the customer service we're trying to provide. So that actually means that we're getting smarter in relation to the service provision. That means that actually the end-user gets a better outcome.\nPL: So you've got a bunch of smart people who've now got more thinking time.\nGK: Yeah.\nPL: Presumably you have also lost some people have you?\nGK: We haven't lost anyone but we probably haven't needed to recruit at the same levels that we have before because actually you spend a lot of time and effort in training, educating, that the main knowledge is exactly what you want to retain because that is the only real differentiator between say traditional engineering consultancies and the tech giants, they've got vast amounts of data, they've got access to all the algorithms but they haven't got the main knowledge of actually how different forms of infrastructure and stakeholders engage with that infrastructure and that data.\nPL: So that brings people to the fore again as a very important asset?\nGK: Absolutely.\nPL: So a slightly unexpected outcome there, it's not just about the tech you're actually highlighting the need for smart people to do some thinking?\nGK: Oh absolutely. They are at the heart of that digital transformation. They're the ones with the creative ideas, they're the ones actually who know in the real world how people react. They can bring the emotion, they can bring the intelligence - the human intelligence aspect - that at the moment the programme can't.\nPL: Yes and as you say at the moment, and playing devil's advocate, presumably if you play in all this human thought and response and emotional reaction to what you're doing you can see how a couple of years down the line you could produce technology that would replicate that and would you then still need the people to do the thinking?\nGK: Well and therein lies the conundrum. As that evolves and as it does become more intelligent will we continue to envisage ever greater solutions or ever greater benefits from the technology? We might not be able to imagine where we might end up so I think it might take a leap at this point but you just don't know is the answer.\nPL: A pretty frank assessment there from Gwion about where they've got to with tech and where they may, or may not, choose to go in future.\nJonny and Jennifer's researchers interviewed 136 people from three organisations in three different sectors. They wanted to explore how they perceived the tech that now plays a part in their work. Useful and labour-saving, were their most popular choices when they were asked to choose from 14 positive and negative words. And over 90% felt confident about using the tech but they had some reservations too.\nYeah I was interested to see and I pulled out one statistic which was around the kind of change in workload, which is as you know a big issue for most working people and about half said they didn't really see much change in their workload after the AI had been implemented, which surprised me. I think it was roughly about a quarter said there was more, about a quarter said there was less.\nJG: But the pace increases.\nPL: But the pace increased and I did think that was really key. So nearly half of them were saying, 'It's the pace.' So they are working harder aren't they? They don't have a bigger workload but somehow they're working faster?\nJG: By contrast the amount of work that they have on their plates doesn't seem to vary so much. My reading of that is that again it's a sensible application of new technology. So there's only so many hours in the day, there's only so much work a person can do, so in effect my reading of that is that the employer's kind of regulating the amount of work that people have on their plates but they're enabling people to do things faster.\nJC: There is a hugely positive spin to this report, we are seeing a number of people who have experience of working with different types of AI and automation really reporting a positive well-being. For example we have 33% of people saying they spent more time working on more interesting tasks.\nBut it's not all a good story. There are other people who found that actually they didn't feel the monotony of their work changed. And there were people who were saying, 'Well I didn't really see any benefits, there were pitfalls associated with it.'\nSo that raises an interesting question about is it the type of technology, is it the way it's implemented? Or is it actually the readiness of the employees or the readiness of the technology?\nPL: So people need to be ready for the tech and the tech needs to be ready for the people. And that's all the people, not just some of them.\nAsif Sadiq: So my name's Asif Sadiq. I am the head of diversity and inclusion for EY Financial Services.\nWhen you look at any sort of artificial intelligence, robotics and so on, there's this whole piece around who's designed it? Is there diversity within the design? And has diversity been factored into the end product? And there's numerous examples of when that hasn't been taken into consideration. There was some software designed for robotics and they didn't consider anyone who was black, so couldn't facially recognise black people. Similarly there's designs where products have been put together for designing access in gyms and you find that because of the way the technology has been designed and those people might have biases themselves, or unconscious biases, technology had been designed where when you think of a doctor the automatic assumption is it's a man and therefore access for a doctor in a gym would be to the make changing rooms not the female changing rooms.\nPL: Okay.\nAS: So I guess there's all these kind of things.\nPL: We're talking about trust here.\nAS: How do I perceive the technology if I don't have trust in the most simplest of technology? And just to give you a very quick example on that a lot of different banks and online systems, including the HMRC, are using voice recognition software where they ask you a question and you input yes and then you give further details. Now my English, I would consider this fairly good, but I still of course being from an ethnic minority background, pronounce certain things slightly differently and I always struggle with those softwares because it will not recognise certain things that I say. Therefore I dismiss it straightaway. And that's I think a big, big issue. So if I can't trust something that basic how do you expect me to trust something that's going to take over so much more?\nPL: Well this is the interesting thing isn't it because as you say it lies at the heart of the whole debate around AI and tech because the thing about data sets you imagine they're a thing but they're created by humans aren't they? There's a selection process and everyone brings their inherent biases, unconscious biases, or implicit biases, to that process. There's the designers themselves, who are they? Are they all white men? Who knows? We don't know, there's no transparency. And all the tech that's coming into our workplace stems from that.\nSo from your point of view absolutely as someone from an ethnic minority why on earth would you believe it was any good for you or anything to do with you? So do you think, I mean this is the thing I think that isn't being discussed that this is the real barrier to adoption that millions of people feel this stuff is not for me. It doesn't know who I am.\nAS: Exactly and I think even more so it's where you have experiences and then the experiences are not positive the likelihood of you then using it again or using any further technology is next to none. So everyone's currently talking about Alexa and the advancements in that and how it doesn't pick up certain accents. So again that is a barrier. So it's supposed to be a great thing for everyone but is it really for everyone?\nPL: And that's a global technology.\nAS: Exactly.\nPL: I mean does this surprise you?\nAS: No, no it doesn't because I mean and that's on languages right? There was another example around YouTube where YouTube when they changed something on their software on how to upload videos and they discovered after a few hours that, I can't remember what number but a large number of videos were upside down and then when they looked at it they discovered that actually the way they'd designed it was for right handed people not left handed, and anyone who was left handed if they put it up it came up upside down.\nUnless you've built into the processes the diversity of thought, diversity of experiences, which you can't really get through surveys or saying that we consulted a large group of people it is actually in the design stage and then the whole situation arises that actually when you look at this sector there isn't much diversity. For diversity to truly bring about innovative ideas you don't need 20 people like me but you need a mix of people, a mix of everything. That's when you've got true diversity. And that goes for any industry or in any sector.\nPL: So Asif's point about tech trust is as relevant in the workplace as it is in our lives outside work and Jennifer agrees if we don't trust tech we'll be far less likely to adopt it.\nJC: Well this is it so it's do I feel that I personally am going to be better off? So I need to have confidence that I'm still going to have employment, that perhaps I might have greater opportunity, that I'm still going to be able to contribute and in fact I'm doing a thing that's going to help me. And these examples here I think are where the organisation as a whole is looking for cost efficiency but perhaps there's a surplus of work so therefore I'm still going to be employed as a result, so there are other things I can do.\nThe outside of this of course when we look at the doom-mongering reports I think you do see an awful lot where if you've got very repetitive tasks that are taken over by a machine I may not cease to stay in employment with that particular employer but that's not what we're seeing in this survey because those are not the kinds of tasks that we're seeing replaced with these particular examples.\nPL: Gwion has some strategies for employees who may be real assets to the organisation but who have concerns about the tech that's being introduced and what it might mean for them.\nGK: Well I've some quite practical solutions to that, I am a practical guy by background, so things such as reverse mentoring are a real obvious solution to that problem and actually that demystifies a lot and takes away a lot of their fear.\nPL: Does it also play into how you reward people because presumably in the past it was about how much time they might spend resolving whatever the issue was, now it's not so much about the time is it because technology's going to enable them to perhaps come up with a solution faster but it doesn't necessarily mean they're being less valuable to you? So in terms of how you build clients, how you pay your own people, is that an issue too?\nGK: Yes that's a real issue. So some of our very best people that we're equipping with this independent thinking and with knowledge of the art of what's possible and we're deploying that in real life scenarios, they're at a premium within the market. At the moment we've kind of got a very inflexible benefits approach within the industry and so those people probably have more value in different industries at the moment which have got maybe some more advanced thinking of it and I'm thinking of the software industry in particular where potentially you're paid and your benefits are related to the value that you bring in and you may be paid over a shorter period of time on say a consultancy basis to produce something, an outcome, rather than on say a time-based salary.\nPL: Right so that's clearly an issue isn't it because you don't want to be losing these people...\nGK: That's right.\nPL: ...to places where they might be better rewarded so you're going to have to rethink the whole way you do it.\nGK: Yes so actually the salary and benefit structure we're having to really think hard about what is going to be models because I don't think that this is going to happen overnight but what models are we going to need to deploy going forward.\nPL: And finally back to Jonny and Jennifer. It sounds, listening to the pair of you, as if the researchers, you found it encouraging in terms of how this is going to play out, amidst all the doom we read and hear about that actually you do see that it's a real positive force for good if we implement in the right way?\nJG: Broadly I think so. We're looking at concrete examples within this research. I think that one of the things that we need to do to get beyond the polemic of both the doom-mongerers [sic] and the utopians is to be less fixated with the futuristic technology and to look at what's happening now with recently developed technology, because there are really concrete examples out there, we don't need to speculate about the technology of tomorrow, we can look at the technology of yesterday and today as it's happening now.\nSo that's what we're doing with this research is to take really concrete examples of how in particular automation, AI and robotics are being used in practice and it's perhaps not surprising that they're used pretty sensibly. There are some glitches in the system that organisations come across, so there are risks there but broadly speaking applied sensibly the benefits are there to be had.\nJC: And what we found is less than 5% of the survey participants thought the emerging technology had a negative effect and that for me is incredibly encouraging about humans' ability to really have their life and work enabled and enriched by AI and automation rather than diminished.\nPL: That's it for this month but something tells me that we'll be looking at this subject again before long, well I say 'we' of course the podcast might be entirely automated by then.\nWhat is definite is that tomorrow is Day 1 of the 71st annual conference and exhibition. It's come round fast hasn't it? Manchester will be heaving with the HR and L&D community, all there to hear from people like Lenny Henry and Shami Chakrabarti - trust, good work, diversity, security and all the other big issues we spend our time thinking about. Now if you can't be with us this time don't worry we'll be recording interviews for upcoming podcasts so you will be able to hear from some of the best speakers right here on the podcast.

      "summary": "As the people profession evolves to meet the needs of a changing business landscape, HR and L&D teams are becoming far more integrated throughout their organisations, working closely with different functions and using their professional skills and knowledge to improve business performance.\nIn this episode we talk to CIPD’s own Director of people, Brad Taylor, as well as Kate Griffiths-Lambeth, HRD at Charles Stanley, along with her CEO and COO, to find out how their teams go about working with a range of different business areas and the importance they place on integrating the HR and L&D functions throughout the organisation.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:23:55\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb:This being the CIPD podcast we often hear from their expert researchers and commentators. With 350 people across the country it's a busy place with a reputation to maintain as the most authoritative voice on people management, but what goes on behind the CIPD's own doors and how does the organisation get the best out of their people? We pinned down director of people Brad Taylor on one of the CIPD's own hottest topics right now - how HR and L&D can drive performance.Brad Taylor: HR and L&D can so much better add value to the business if they're integrated within the business, not seen as a separate function and sitting on the side, putting together its own agendas, the sorts of initiatives that it thinks should be going on, but actually working with managers, understanding the business, understanding the issues that they're facing, where do they want their business to be, and then developing those range of solutions around that to help them achieve that.\nPL: It sounds like common sense doesn't it but it's still by no means mainstream really is it?\nBT: That's right it does sound like common sense and I think there's a need for conversation and debate to take place on both sides as to what sort of things does HR and L&D need to stop doing in order that they can get much more closer to the business, working with the business and really add value to them.\nPL: So how does it work here?\nBT: So here we have evolved a partnering model, so we have HR business partners, but we also have Learning and Development partners as well and their role is, as much as possible, to be out with the business, talking with directors, heads of department, line managers, understanding the issues that they're trying to tackle and then developing strategic or tactical solutions that they can deploy that will enable them to achieve those objectives.\nSo we're moving away from a historic HR function that tells line managers here's what you need to do, or, you did that wrong let me tell you what you should have done, to much more what are the frameworks that we need to put in place that means that those line managers can use those frameworks as effectively as possible.\nPL: And how do you arrive at the overarching strategy that makes all that possible, because obviously these are individual relationships between various HR partners and their opposite numbers but clearly there's a direction of travel for the CIPD so what happens at the start of that?\nBT: So we start with the overall organisational strategy, what is it that the organisation is trying to achieve and then we speak with directors and with heads of department and with line managers and people to really understand what are the issues that they're facing, what things are working really well for them, but where are the challenges.\nWe have an internal staff consultation group, a sounding board, which we have trained specifically on how to have strategic conversations with directors to understand those issues and we also have a regular, always on, employee pulse survey, so that people can tell us what are the areas that they are satisfied in, what are the areas that are most important to them.\nAnd from all of that we then constructed our people strategy around three core areas. So those areas are effectively the CIPD experience, what does it feel like to work here with us? And so therefore what's the culture in the leadership that's supporting that.\nSecondly what does the future capability of the organisation need to look like to help people understand where we're going and giving them the development opportunities to go into those roles.\nAnd then the third area is how we have a strategically aligned outcomes-focussed business. So how do we make it as easy as possible for people to get things done.\nPL: So that's how they do it at the CIPD. But how about a very different organisation with very different challenges. Charles Stanley is an investment management company with roots going back to 1792. It's one of the oldest firms on the London Stock Exchange but it operates in a business environment that is fiercely competitive, tech-reliant and constantly evolving. And while Charles Stanley does treasure its history there is nothing old fashioned about the way it drives performance.\nKate Griffiths-Lambeth, a lawyer by training, is group director of human resources. Paul Abberley is the CEO and Michael Bennett the chief operating officer. Now we all sat down together in their Bishopsgate HQ to talk about how they believe HR and L&D can drive business objectives. Here's Kate.\nKate Griffiths-Lambeth: It's impossible to my mind to do a good job in HR if you don't understand what the business is trying to do and to work with it to achieve those objectives. So it's not, you know HR for years has said we need a voice at the table, actually step forward, have a voice, talk with people, learn and work with the areas to achieve what needs to be done. So we have here in Charles Stanley HR business partners who work directly and very, very closely with each of the divisional heads. I work very closely with Paul and with the rest of the executive team. I view myself as part of the team, I don't view myself as slightly distanced and I think that's where the nub of change needs to be.\nPL: And that is the change isn't it, recently. Paul I'm interested, obviously you've worked at other organisations how has it been there, I imagine quite different?\nPaul Abberley: Well I've been working in finance for about 35 years so I've seen the complete trend and I see sort of three phases: in the old days it was personnel.\nPL: This is Paul Abberley, the CEO.\nPA: The move towards HR was a recognition that the impact of good HR practice on your staff would make a big difference to profitability. I think what's new nowadays is if we've gone from personnel to HR where HR is seen to be supporting the business, the third stage, which I think we're still in the early stages of in most companies, is viewing HR as a way of powering performance, so actually putting it front and centre and saying, can you use HR insiders to drive performance as opposed to just support performance that's driven by their executives.\nPL: Back at CIPD HQ in Wimbledon I put some of the points from the Charles Stanley team to Brad Taylor. Does he agree that HR and L&D should be doing more than simply supporting the business?\nBT: I agree with that. I think that the role of HR should be to understand business as much as it possibly can. What are the things that are going on within the organisation that's making it easy to be effective and what are the things that are getting in the way or restricting the organisation from evolving and developing? And the only way to achieve that is to be close to the business and working with its leaders, working with its people, putting the things in place, the channels in place for that information to come back in so that it can go away and think about these things and then work with the business to develop solutions.\nPL: Now of course a shift like that doesn't happen overnight, at Charles Stanley integrating HR and L&D into the business is an ongoing process and it began several years ago.\nPA: Well from my viewpoint learning and development, when I joined the company, was very much around technical skills. It belonged more under the heading of personnel frankly than HR. I think the change in the last few years is that we've said learning and development is not just about what you need to be able to do but how would you go about doing it? So bringing the behaviours and the values closer to the technical skills, which can have a bigger impact on productivity than simply giving people better technical skills.\nPL: Brad agrees. L&D isn't just about skills, values and behaviours they're critical.\nBT: Skills can be taught. Values and behaviours is something that I think organisations need to be good at, first of all understanding what matters to them and then secondly how does it identify those within people, both within talent that it's looking to bring into the organisation but also existing talent across the organisation as well. What sort of signals is it sending out to say, this matters to us and this is important, versus this doesn't.\nAnd I think sometimes organisations can fall into the trap of trying to be everything to everyone and that sends an unclear message because people will draw different conclusions as to what's good and I think HR has a role in helping leadership have that bigger view, that sort of high level view as to what's going on across the organisation and where's the climate of the organisation going.\nPL: Here's Kate again.\nKG-L: You can also use L&D as a way of helping transform a business. So we founded a group leadership development programme very shortly after Paul became CEO. We deliberately had high performing stars from across the organisation on it. That gave an opportunity to reduce the silo mentality, for people to have a shared attitude about what we're trying to do. It's almost like using it as a communication channel.\nPL: So this group leadership development programme is a joint venture that's breaking down barriers right across the business and generating useful strategy ideas.\nKG-L: Paul set those individuals on the first cohort and we're now on to cohort four actually and every single cohort has had a CEO challenge for them to go away and come back to and present either to the board or the executive committee, that is a business-related issue that we needed to resolve.\nPL: What sort of things?\nKG-L: We've looked at flexible working. We've looked at how do we enhance collaboration and communication across different areas.\nPL: Yeah, do they enjoy it, it sounds fun?\nKG-L: I think they love it.\nPL: So I mean obviously they get to the end, this is over the course of a year?\nKG-L: People have said it's life-changing. People have actually said that it's really made me think about things in a different way.\nPL: So everything they do, not just stuff that might be affected by regulatory issues but the way they operate in the entirety of their job role changes?\nKG-L: Yeah.\nMichael Bennett: And if a number of people have worked in an organisation for a long time this is absolutely the first experience of this type of training that they've ever had.\nPL: This is Michael Bennett, Charles Stanley's COO.\nMB: No intervention at all and so from that point of view it is completely different. For some of them it is a shock.\nPL: So from your point of view what sort of behavioural changes are you seeing, not just in the general employers but amongst line managers I suppose is the most interesting?\nMB: It's very much the way that the managers are leading their teams and actually challenging their teams to become more productive, to become more effective.\nPL: And you're getting better outcomes?\nMB: Yeah, significantly better outcomes in terms of that breadth of thinking and the extension of what they're doing, and how it fits into the bigger picture.\nKG-L: We also see it in things like Paul runs an Ask Expert session on the last Friday of the month which is filmed and anybody across the company, anywhere can ask questions but the kind of questions that people are asking now it's not, why doesn't the lift work?\nPL: What are they asking?\nKG-L: They're much more, what are our competitors up to; when are we going to do it? So people are thinking more strategically. They are interested in where the business is going toward and why. They want to know why we're changing the pricing on something or what's happening with the launch of the CSD app, or which are the market sectors that we now think we ought to be going into, what does an ideal client look like? I don't think three years ago people would have asked you those questions?\nPA: They certainly wouldn't have asked any of those sort of questions. It's been a profound change.\nPL: These shifts are also producing wins by encouraging employees to be more curious about the business and they're also generating some unexpected career moves.\nKG-L: It's good for people to see that you can progress and that you're not always going to automatically look for someone externally to step into a role. And I really appreciate the fact that Charles Stanley is prepared to give people opportunities outside their immediate level.\nPL: What sort of things?\nKG-L: So people have moved from IT into front office areas. People have moved from compliance to work directly into client-facing roles. Our head of strategy was originally in the finance department.\nPA: Absolutely and I would add to that that when you encourage mobility internally clearly there are frictional costs because there's disruption if someone leaves Department A, Department A's got to backfill, but it's paid off many fold in terms of improved productivity because you have people that have worked in more than one department and that helps break down the silo mentality.\nPL: Indeed. They ((0:12:21?)) with them.\nPA: ...so that the productivity impact is profound, well worth the frictional cost.\nKG-L: It also sometimes enables you to understand the organisation better. So we've got another chap called Eliot who's moved from finance to work for a while in an operational role in the investment management area. When he was in finance, I mentor Eliot so I have a fair amount of discussion with him, he was sort of, 'I don't understand why they don't just do this, on paper it's blindingly obvious. We should just do this, this and this and then we'd get that.' And it's only having sat in the operational area he's said to me, rather ruefully, 'I now understand why...'\nPL: Why they don't.\nKG-L: But at the same time he's able to discuss, 'Well if we could sort this and this out we would be able to do that, and that would be obviously better for everybody.' So because of both his knowledge from the first area where he was working and where he is now he's much better positioned to help carry the business forwards.\nPL: So this effort to mesh L&D and HR with the business means that people are moving sideways or diagonally in a way they never used to do. Now does Brad see that at the CIPD too?\nThey mentioned that with this more inclusive approach to everything the organisation does in HR, L&D in driving performance, they had seen people move in completely unexpected directions in terms of their career paths within the organisation because the whole thing had become more transparent and they'd seen routes that they hadn't thought of before. Have you found that at all? Has that happened here at all?\nBT: Yes we've tried this at the CIPD and what I've found that the HR business partners have been able to do is to challenge line managers in their thinking either about the career paths where they think their people could go but also where they might perceive limitations or restrictions because the HR business partners are very well placed to look at the organisation much more holistically and see where there's opportunities for certain strengths to be better deployed. And what we're also keen to do, as part of our evolving approach with this, is to help people tell us more about the skills and capabilities that they have that don't directly relate to their day job, so the sort of hobbies and activities they like to do perhaps outside of work that we might have opportunity to use on certain projects and programmes that we're doing within the CIPD.\nSo an example would be we have someone in my own HR team who works on payroll who has a very keen interest in photography and videography, so we've been able to give her opportunities to get involved in that, in putting videos together for the CIPD, or working on some of the photography that we need with part of our collateral.\nPL: Back with Charles Stanley they explained how vital it is to explain these new ideas to everyone and that is where head of comms, Joanne Higginson is making a really big contribution.\nKG-L: A lot of it comes down to communication and in a funny kind of way L&D is communication.\nPL: Well it is indeed but how do you handle the comms end of it?\nKG-L: When Paul first became CEO and we did our first engagement survey one of the things that came out was that people felt that communication was dire.\nPL: All right, not unusually.\nKG-L: We have appointed an excellent head of PR and Comms and Jo has taken us from a rating on the engagement survey of being poor to now being excellent and it's things like the Ask Ex Co, the creation of various magazines, publications, some of it perhaps slightly gimmicky so when we launched our values we printed the values on M&Ms and put M&Ms round on everybody's desk, but it's a way of getting the message across.\nPL: To get people talking about it.\nKG-L: Using things like screensavers, so actually when you come in and you log on in the morning there's a message there for you, it might be at the moment the message about risk but we've used that again with the values, with conduct outcomes, lots of different ways of getting messages across.\nPL: So you're road-testing various routes of disseminating these ideas and what, cherry-picking the ones you feel are working best, the ones that are going down best?\nPA: Yes absolutely. some of them work better than others and if they don't work you drop them and that's absolutely fine. I think the key element in this is to ensure that the L&D related comms are wrapped up in broader commercial comms. It's dangerous to separate them and you don't want people thinking okay this is an HR thing. So if they get something from the CEO which talks in very quantitative terms about the latest monthly P&L and then seamlessly moves into something around a challenge you might be having with a particular value then that really emphasises to staff, even if subliminally, that actually these things are very much bound together.\nPL: So they're thinking creatively about how to communicate this stuff to the employees and the CIPD also think hard about how to communicate their new ideas to their people.\nBT: Posters down in the main reception when people come in that talk about our strategy or the sort of initiatives that we're working on, through to working with our employee consultation group, talking about the strategic inspirations and what we're doing, through to blogs, the director's blog about the individual strategies that they're working on to try and encourage people to get involved and take part in contributing to those but also then relaying back here's the progress that we've made, through to news articles on the intranet and then to help people find those articles on the intranet we have a weekly email that goes out every Thursday that highlights the key stories and things that took place that week.\nWe've even started, over the last few months, doing a blog after every senior leadership team meeting where one of the directors will take turns to just blog - here are the things that we spoke about in the meeting - so that people get a sense of what's on our minds and the direction that we're taking the business in.\nPL: Yes and what went on in the meeting room that they weren't party to.\nBT: Yes.\nPL: How nice. But nothing printed on M&Ms for you?\nBT: We've not done the M&Ms yet although it sounds like a good idea. I think we could look at that.\nPL: And that is the thought that's running through all of this as far as I can see this idea that you have completely moved away from the idea that there is HR, there is learning, there are courses, there are things you'll need to do and it's all hung off this skeleton of business performance and driving the business.\nBT: Very much so.\nPL: Are you finding Kate that you're getting much more buy-in from people when they don't think, this is something I've got to do, it's some box-ticking exercise, they understand where it might take them career-wise, where they might contribute to the business.\nKG-L: I think people are actually seeing the tangible difference both for individuals and for the business as a whole.\nPL: That is encouraging isn't it because I mean it's an issue for lots of organisations this, you know pushing that stuff to the bottom of the pile for a lot of people, senior and junior, it's not their day job but it sounds as if you're trying to enforce the message this is your day job, or at least it's part of your day job.\nKG-L: It's part of it yeah.\nPA: And again a cautionary note because the path is never entirely smooth with these things, to the extent that you're successful in improving the awareness you also make a rod for your own back because the expectations of the staff go up, so they say, 'Yeah we get this now let's do more of it,' and to some degree the staff's expectations can run ahead of the executive function's ability to deliver some of this stuff so they say, 'Let's run faster.'\nPL: Examples?\nPA: I think the pace of change and restructuring so there's still quite a lot that needs to be done in terms of transforming the firm, when you're looking at it from my perspective I can see risks and rewards in terms of the path we would take and if it's restructuring a particular division then the staff in that division, or even outside that division, might say, 'Well let's just go ahead and do it. Let's crack on, why wait?' I'm looking at it from a risk-adjusted perspective and I'm thinking, well there's a few things that could go wrong here but the staff would say, 'No, just do it for goodness sake. Why are you prevaricating?'\nPL: The final thing I wanted to ask you really is for people listening to this, your advice for people who are still living in the usual world where these things are less integrated, more siloed, still slightly the old model of HR sitting in one corner, L&D sitting in the other and the business being somewhere over there, what would your tips be, pitfalls, advice?\nPA: Well the first thing I'd say is you need at least one person in the organisation that's experienced this elsewhere. I think a second point is lots of communications before you even start because you have to prepare your staff for what you're going to be doing next otherwise you'll just race ahead of them and they'll just be left bewildered by all the change. So I think experience and comms before you start are the two key things.\nMB: It's getting the right person. So if you're going to embed a business partner in an area they really have to be the right person, both from the point of view of knowing what we're trying achieve as a company but also being able to appreciate and understand the people they're representing, the people they're working with.\nPL: What was the hardest part?\nKG-L: The change here so far, educating people that it was possible so that they would make the stab to do the change because I've got a person in my team who joined in 1969, he's never worked anywhere else, why would he know there's a different way of doing things? And there are a lot of people across the company but it did mean that for many people doing something different it just hadn't been on their horizon.\nPA: And I think firms also need to be aware that there's no reverse gear. That's another cautionary note, once you go down this path it's no good in 18 months saying either, 'Well we're bored with that,' or alternatively saying, 'Well this is all too difficult we're going to go back to the old days.' There is no reverse gear, once you open up this approach to staff they will embrace it inevitably and then you have to have that long-term commitment to see it through. So if you're not really committed, you know, don't start unless you're really committed to doing this properly.\nPL: As you probably already know the CIPD is drawing up a new professional standards framework reflecting the themes we've been talking about. Here's HR chief Brad, he's been very involved right from the start.\nBT: Yes so the new professional standards framework is coming, a lot of work has gone into this including speaking with our members to understand how they use their skills at the moment as HR and L&D professionals but it's looking at what does it mean to be a modern HR or L&D professional? What is it that the CEO, the leadership teams, would expect of the people profession to really be able to help the business to understand why things are happening in a certain way? Why are people behaving in a certain way? What are their expectations of work? How can the organisations think about how work can be done differently given the way that the world of work is moving?\nAnd I think that's what will really demonstrate HR and L&D's value at the table in being able to articulate these things. We understand people, we understand why they behave the way they do and we understand what things need to be put in place to make the organisation as professional as possible and all things will be coming out in the New Year.\nPL: So not long to wait. Feel free to share this pod with anyone involved in driving performance at your own organisation, or indeed anywhere else, it might be useful.

      "description": "Episode 140: How can learning and development professionals drive performance and productivity in their organisations?",
      "summary": "In the changing context of work, performance and productivity are key considerations for organisations of every size. Today’s L&D teams play a vital role in helping organisations to address these issues. In order to do so, learning must be embedded at the heart of their businesses and this may mean a significant shift in learning culture. L&D teams must seek to revolutionise their approach if they are to drive productivity and performance in their organisations.\nIn this episode we explore the latest research from Towards Maturity which looks at L&D in high-performing organisations and how they are able to achieve astounding improvements in their performance and productivity. We discuss the role L&D practitioners, senior leaders and managers play in driving these changes and challenges they may face. And we hear from an organisation that has already implemented many of the recommendations from the research.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:19:41\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: Your report was feisty.\nLaura Overton: Feisty. That's an interesting word.\nPL: Laura Overton is CEO at Towards Maturity and an old friend of the podcast. Now she's co-authored a report looking at what sets high performing organisations apart from the rest.\nLO: What makes you say that?\nPL: Do you know the reason I said it was feisty because we pulled out various quotes from it, and this is my personal favourite 'The L&D industry is in flux and overwhelmed and under-skilled and less than 50% of L&D professionals have the ability to consistently drive the seven key priorities we've highlighted for modern professionals' That doesn't sound great does it?\nLO: It doesn't sound great but I think it's just a reflection of the fact that everyone in work is overworked and under-skilled. There's so much change, technology, transformation, is having such a massive impact on the thinking and the behaviour of organisations that learning professionals aren't alone in this space but I think there is a deep awareness that they need to be much more agile. We've found that in the research over the last year over 90% of learning and development leaders are saying, 'We want to be able to help the organisation respond faster to change.'\nPL: It's a real concern though isn't it because I think elsewhere in your report you make the point that organisations are turning away from L&D and reaching for change consultants and external professionals and people outside their organisation because they're not understanding the connection between well-designed and delivered L&D and business performance. So is this first and foremost a communication breakdown?\nLO: I think it's a communication breakdown but I also think first and foremost a lot of business leaders are looking at their learning functions as cost centres, as those who are just generating courses, proving compliance and they're not expecting anything else. Expectations of learning and development have been set low and no one's breaking the mould.\nPL: Towards Maturity has been investigating how learning innovation can impact on a business for 15 years now. This latest report analyses how 700 top tier global organisations have achieved impressive improvements in productivity and performance. It also looks at how the rest of us can do the same\nAndy Lancaster: I'm Andy Lancaster, head of learning and development content at the CIPD. This report was really important for CIPD and we were really interested to distil the things in terms of learning and development that directly drive performance, hence the title of the report Driving Performance and Productivity. So we now know that whatever sector, whatever organisation you're in performance and productivity are two things that are likely to keep your senior managers awake at night. So now we need to think about learning which is relevant and impactful in a workplace that's\nchanging, where globalisation is creating all sorts of complex challenges, where the diverse workforce now has a variety of needs, where we need to think about delivering learning across dispersed locations. And for that to be the case we just can't have an old paradigm where we have occasional face to face courses but we now need learning which is delivered in the heart of the organisation. So at the heart of this report we looked at the data to see against those kind of factors what are the things that will really drive performance in organisations and we found some very interesting conclusions.\nPL: One of those conclusions was that high performance learning organisations are, on average, seeing their productivity and performance leap up 24% as a result of learning done well.\nAL: What we found in the research was some real common sense factors which really drive performance from a learning perspective. But the interesting thing is even though these are real common sense they're not always common practice. So there's some very practical concepts and ideas here and if we do these they'll have a real impact on learning that drives performance. And there was four key areas: goal-setting, getting there smarter, building ownership and empowering people.\nPL: And in each of those four areas the report goes on to suggest practical and applicable ideas for building effective learning.\nLO: I think what the headlines for me were that actually these tactics are not rocket science. They are not, you know investing in the latest and snazziest artificial intelligence or robotics or redefine who you are. It's about going back to the basics. Goal-setting for example, what we found had a correlation back with productivity and performance was the whole issue of managers discussing with staff what they expect them to be able to do differently as a result of a formal learning intervention. How simple is that? And yet it has such a powerful correlation with that individual coming back and being able to connect and yet a fraction of us are actually taking these strategies and making them work.\nPL: So let's take each of the four areas in turn. First goal-setting.\nAL: What we found was the organisations which are really good at driving performance, the objectives of learning are discussed with individuals before they start the learning process. So this is about planning before someone even engages with learning and great learning organisations have these conversations to really prime people before their learning experience.\nPL: Not only this but there's ongoing support from line managers\nAL: So there's that kind of process going on to ask and shadow and coach someone to ensure the learning is being applied. And lastly we also saw a third important trait where there's a real strong communication between line managers and supervisors and learning and development. In other words we need to think about revisiting learning, maybe a few weeks, months or even years from the learning activity, to understand how those goals are being met.\nSo some practical tips from our leaders and learning network who had a look at the report, firstly we really need to integrate goal-setting as part of our one to one supervised meetings. It's no good not to have those discussions going on.\nAnd goals really need to be objective and not subjective. And also we really see for goal-setting an active engagement between learning and development and line managers. It's really good that we invest in our managers to have those great performance conversations.\nAnd we also need to define how a goal is going to be evidenced. So if we're going to provide some learning how can we see that that's really being evidenced in the workplace? And this kind of continuous feedback needs to be in place.\nSo some really practical things we can do in terms of making goal-setting really objective but also tracking how the learning is having an influence of the delivery of that learning within the workplace.\nPL: The next part of the report, getting there smarter, looks at how to use insights to improve learning transfer.\nAL: And what we found from the research study was about 50% of the real top learning organisations were now actively using learning analytics to improve the design and delivery of their learning services. So what we're seeing is a real emphasis on understanding what we're trying to measure and perhaps more specifically why. It's no good us measuring everything we need to be very targeted in thinking about the smart measures that we have to understand how learning is affecting performance.\nAnd what we're also seeing as well this is about quantitative and qualitative data. So this is not just about numbers but also thinking about great stories, great case studies which can evidence how learning transfer is taking place.\nAnd for that there's a number of things which we can see really underpin this. Firstly the data we're looking at needs to be business data not learning data. So we need to understand that the learning is driving a business outcome. And to that extent often L&D professionals need to get much more confident in the use of data and metrics and in particular how data and metrics are used in the business.\nAnd also that really requires us to think about stakeholder relationships because often the data is not owned by learning and development it's owned elsewhere, maybe customer services or finance. So that stakeholder relationship is really important.\nPL: Laura has thought hard about the barriers that can obstruct that synergy between learning and business performance.\nWe were discussing earlier actually this issue of designing L&D around the objectives for the organisation and breaking that down into departments and how that can work in organisations because well alignment, why everyone is doing what they're doing.\nAnd there still seems to be in common practice this idea of L&D as being somehow siloed from the core purpose of the organisation and we've been talking about that for years in podcasts and in print and yet it still persists, why do you think that is?\nBecause L&D professionals they arrive at events, they educate themselves, I don't think there's any lack of intent on the part of L&D as a profession, is the resistance at the other end is it more that C Suite just still hasn't grasped how learning and development can directly play into their business objectives?\nLO: I believe so. I think it's because of the language that we use. Now I'm not saying that learning and development professionals should drop the language that sets their profession apart but we need to know how to interpret it for business. And that means first and foremost starting where the business is at. So for example in this report we're talking about driving performance and productivity because that's what's important to government; that's what's important to business leaders; that's the point where we should start talking about what we're able to do for organisations, that point of creating value for an organisation. If we can establish our credibility by saying, 'We understand what's important to business right now and we believe that we can help you drive that,' suddenly the business will say, 'Maybe this is worth discussing. Tell me more,' and then we can start to bring our expertise to apply the solutions to those business problems. We can start to create value. We can talk about business value rather than talking about models or learning management systems or compliance or look how much money I've saved you. Really talking about the issues that matter to business actually starts to address that communication breakdown.\nJonathan Holmes: I'm Jonathan Holmes. I work for NFU Mutual and I'm a learning technologies manager.\nPL: Learning technologies?\nJH: Yes.\nPL: Interesting job title is it literally tech end of L&D?\nJH: Yeah it is so I have a team of learning management system analysts and a team of digital designers. So it's the physical technology and the software.\nPL: Jonathan and his people are featured in the report as a great example of an L&D team which is driving high performance. So can we check, just talking about the strategy, how NFU Mutual designs and conceives its L&D strategy across the board?\nJH: So it's about understanding what the various business units have, in particular the profit making side of the business. What are their imperatives? What are they changing? What's their strategy?\nPL: So what sort of things do they say to you then? What sort of things are they preoccupied with?\nJH: So very much around performance, very much around productivity. One of the key themes for us and them at the moment is what does productivity look like and therefore what sort of performance indicators are we looking to try and instil, trying to achieve, in order to allow us or to enable a level of productivity that importantly we can all agree on.\nPL: Yes not much point starting if you don't know where you're going.\nJH: Yes.\nPL: Okay so you understand, you have conversations with the various areas of the business about what they're preoccupied with, what they're changing, what their aspirations are, what their business objectives are, and then back in your department you sit down and do what?\nJH: We're very much an internal design and delivery organisation at the moment. We have teams of very specialist designers. So we may be building learning journeys, learning pathways, to enable that productivity. We do a lot of discovery at the moment around the required knowledge, skills and behaviours that are critical to that final success.\nPL: What sort of things, give me examples?\nJH: In terms of what the knowledge might be for example?\nPL: Yeah.\nJH: So working in insurance we're currently working, or just about to start working with our customer services team to really help them refresh what it means to be in terms of the knowledge and the competency levels within NFU Mutual, as well as investigating, so from my side, the technology side, investigating what tools do we have that can enable to competence uplift and the measurement of that competence?\nPL: So as well as talking to business leaders Jonathan's team also talk regularly to employees on the ground and from this they've designed a learner journey.\nJH: This is really to engage the business with three simple ideas around engaging with their audience, gaining some commitment, measuring where they're at at the moment in terms of their knowledge, skills and behaviour. Secondary, providing the input, activating. And then the final piece of our journey is the acceleration. So back in the workplace how is your learning being embedded and how is it developing your performance.\nPL: This concept nicely mirrors the third wheel in the research findings which is about encouraging and enabling people to take ownership of their own learning.\nAL: Now we're well aware that self-directed learning and learning which learners are engaged with there's much higher levels of motivation around those learning processes. So rather than having learning imposed on you as a staff member to include you as part of the design and delivery process is really, really important. So what we found was in great learning organisations high percentages now are understanding how people not only currently learn but also want to learn. And we make assumptions that people want to go on courses but the reality is there are many ways in which people can learn in the workplace. So there's kind of intelligence about asking learners how can we help you improve? Direct questions about what would be useful to you? And really involving learners in the learning process and learning design is really important.\nWhat we also found as well great learning organisations also have really strong communication plans around learning. So conversations really matter in terms of building that two-way kind of relationship around learning.\nPL: So how do you make that work?\nAL: Firstly you allow people to have their own career goals. This is not about the organisation just telling you what to do; this is about you owning your development. And also asking questions, what do you need to do your job well, what's stopping you from being great at your job, will give us real insights.\nAnd also a number of organisations now are really building great libraries of learner-generated content, learners sharing their own stories, creating their own videos and podcasts, just like this podcast here as well.\nAnd we're also seeing some really creative things going on now. Some organisations are having personal learning budgets which allow people to invest in their own particular learning solutions. So ownership is at the heart of learning that drives performance and we really need to engage learners as part of the learning process.\nPL: Here's Jonathan Holmes again.\nJH: If we're piloting new ways of working and we're always looking for continuously developing our offering, that might not necessarily be changing content but it might be changing the format of training. So we're constantly surveying, constantly asking questions, again with line managers getting their feedback on whether or not...for example would they recommend this new method of delivery? We use the term piloting quite a lot but my view is we're not really piloting, we're iteratively improving. So yeah it's a constant conversation.\nPL: The last chunk of the research is about empowering people and support mechanisms that drive performance. One of the mechanisms that is often overlooked is building in time for people to reflect.\nAL: And really interesting, this was perhaps one of the most interesting things for me personally, in this area of the report we also found that great learning organisation really encourage time for reflection. You're probably in the same situation as I am that your Outlook diary is chaotic and we just don't seem to have enough time to stop and think and great learning organisations that are driving performance are encouraging staff to stop and have time to reflect on their performance and reflect on their learning. It could be individual; it could be discussion groups, communities of practice. So it's really important to think about how we can encourage that reflective piece.\nSo just some practical ideas around empowering people. I think we've got to make learning intrinsic to our organisational culture. So part of that is have really good coaching conversations between managers and staff as well and part of that is this kind of reflective piece but also we're now seeing communities of practice, collaboration and discussion, allowing people to have those active discussions really are empowering them as part of their learning process.\nSo part of L&D's role is really to scaffold great collaboration but also to look at the barriers which might prevent this empowerment and to think about how we can put measures in place which really empower people to not only take control of their learning but also to apply what they're learning as well.\nPL: You'll find the tools on the CIPD website. If you're keen to know more about the self-directed learning that Andy was talking about last month's podcast was all about that so find it wherever you found this one. And looking ahead here's Andy again with a run-down of upcoming L&D events.\nAL: So what's coming up for CIPD in the next few months and also in terms of our work with Towards Maturity. Well perhaps the most significant thing is we're going to be launching our new professional standards framework which will define the knowledge which underpins great learning and development and also the skills of learning and development professionals. So those particular standards are going to define very practical things that we need to have in place and this will drive brand new professional development themes for CIPD which will be developing content but one thing we're really interested in tracking is how our new professional standards map against the new learning organisation. So we're now doing some work to see how those skills which we know learning and development professionals need will actually drive the new learning organisation. And that's the research which we'll be releasing later this year.\nPL: That's it for this month and if you found this useful feel free to share it round your networks and of course feed your comments back to us. We are always keen to hear what you think. Thanks for listening.

      "description": "Episode 139: We look at the rise of self-directed learning in today’s organisations and the challenges and opportunities it presents.",
      "summary": "Self-directed learning is nothing new. As early as 1840, self-development has been celebrated and today, with the rise of new technologies and social platforms, self-directed learning is more accessible and relevant than ever before. So why are many organisations resistant to the idea of self-directed learning?\nSelf-directed learning represents a move away from traditional, classroom-based learning, empowering individuals to take charge of their own learning needs. It allows learners to proceed at their own pace, according to their own needs and in a style that suits them. However, it is not without its challenges.\nIn this episode we explore what self-directed learning looks like in today’s organisations and what challenges and opportunities it offers for both the individuals and their businesses. We ask how L&D professionals can best support self-directed learners and what conditions are necessary for self-directed learning to be successful in an organisation.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:11:04\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: 30 years ago a Canadian academic published a study that challenged all the old ideas about how we learn new things. Alan Tough argued that adults just didn't need formally certified educators because they learnt perfectly well by themselves. But self-directed learning in the workplace isn't quite as simple as that. Even though with digital it's easier than it's ever been for people to find stuff out learning and development professionals still need to balance autonomous learning with the organisation's objectives and that balance isn't always easy to find.\nVirgin Media discovered that for themselves three years ago when they launched an online portal management academy as part of their self-directed learning strategy.\nDavid Chivers:-Month by month you could go in and look at the users of that academy: there were four people in there pretty much every month because we'd done that very much, you remember the film Field of Dreams with Kevin Costner 'if you build it they will come' we'd gone right well there's a great digital portal everyone will use that now won't they?\nPL: And they didn't come.\nDC: And nobody went there because we hadn't built what they needed. The learning that was on there was kind of standard learning, a little bit of our tools, so we needed to build it for the learner, with the learner to draw them in.\nPL: For the learner, with the learner says David Chivers there. He's head of Learning Operations at Virgin Media, but how to do that? Let's start by getting back to basics and talking to a couple of experts. Barbara Thompson is from PA Consulting and David Hayden is an L&D consultant with the CIPD. I asked them both for a definition of self-directed learning.\nBarbara Thompson: It means two things. It's one that you're providing the framework, the resources, to enable people to do what they're doing naturally and from the bottom up perspective it's that they have the time and the support to be able to follow their passions and dreams and motivations.\nDavid Hayden: I think from my perspective one of the things that it clearly isn't is anarchy within learning. So I think sometimes self-directed learning has been translated as people then often do whatever they want to do.\nPL: A free for all...\nDH: Absolutely.\nPL: ...with your budget.\nDH: And absolutely it's not that, like you say it's about a framework.\nPL: Because it's as Barbara said it's this idea of enabling people to do what they already want to do in order to do their work better, be more productive, whatever it is and I'm wondering, because this is all we're hearing about now self-directed learning, everyone's talking about it. Social learning obviously is part of it but self-directed learning is this the flipside of the constant change environment, that it's really the only sort of learning that can quite keep pace with the pace of change?\nBT: I'm not sure actually. I think it has always been pervasive, it always exists and the degree to which the organisation understands full motivations and attitudes will never be as pronounced as what the individual would know about that.\nPL: But that's what I mean really that people know what they need to know don't they?\nBT Yeah absolutely. So it will always be there bubbling up but it's the degree to which L&D can join their party rather than L&D saying, 'Well come and join ours.'\nPL: And while fostering a learning culture is vital the learning that goes on does need to walk in step with the business's aims and objectives. At Virgin Media that was the challenge that triggered a complete overhaul of their L&D strategy.\nDC: So this was a big push for us in Virgin Media. So for a number of years we've not really aligned any of our learning function to our business priorities, so over the last couple of years we've gone through a bit of a transformation where we have brought in some additional roles that are business partnering roles that work and sit as part of the senior leadership teams in each of our divisions to understand their direction, where they're trying to go, and then to start to build the learning programmes and support tools and devices that will sit behind that so that we're more aligned to where they're trying to go as an organisation.\nPL: That's interesting can we dig into the detail of that a bit? So you've got people across the organisation who are tasked with this idea of thinking about business imperatives and how that should translate into learning...\nDC: Yeah.\nPL: ...bring them together and then?\nDC: Absolutely. So we've got six people who sit across the division and they are actually targeted on the business performance of their divisions as well as their L&D outputs as well. So the success of that division will determine whether they're successful as well. So that's a key driver for those individuals.\nPL: So they're invested.\nDC: It makes sure they're invested in everything having an end result. But the biggest thing for us is measuring any learning that we do from an ROI perspective and not just what a lot of learning professionals are great at doing the level one and level two feedback and understanding whether people enjoyed the course or learnt something but actually that next level of learning transfer - are we seeing that happening in the business, are people taking the things that they've learnt, either online, digitally or in face to face programmes and implementing them? And then is\nthat impacting the key business measures? So are we actually starting to drive customer satisfaction? Are we actually driving better sales? Are we actually driving quicker turnaround in terms of faults that we're fixing etc.? So if those aren't turning and the dial on those isn't improving we look to then go back and say, 'Okay how do we alter those learning programmes? How do we improve them to start to turn those down?'\nPL: Okay so backtracking a bit to objectives that's the sort of thing you're talking so do you set, what a specific number of objectives or objectives around each department? How does it all come together into a strategy?\nDC: Generally people will set around eight objectives a year. Four of those will be business aligned so they'll be about where is my division going. So if I'm setting up a customer support division for instance it'll be about four significant objectives as to what that division wants to achieve this year.\nPL: And what might they be?\nDC: So those would be anything from customer satisfaction for instance. So one of the biggest drivers in our organisation and across our industry is MPS. So we're always looking to drive that up and ensure our customers are happier with the service that we provide them. So typically you would see that sort of measure in their objectives on an annual basis. So four that are business aligned, then there'll usually be a couple that are around the learning programmes that they're pushing out and bringing some sort of innovation or future technology into those programmes. And then there'll usually be a couple of individual objectives for individuals as well to push up.\nPL: Okay so they know what they want to achieve and in terms of delivering the learning and encouraging the learning how does that then work on from that process?\nDC: Yes, so lots of different ways in Virgin Media we do this. So we have lots of different sites. So our main portal is a site called iDiscover which we've built internally with our own resource. So we use that to communicate extensively to the workforce but more than anything we also believe in a relentless pursuit of engagement and comms in a physical manner as well. We have a lot of contact centres and we have a lot of our people out there in the road. So we encourage our learning professionals, and there are quite a few of us there's around 140 learning professionals in Virgin Media, to actually get out and be involved in team meetings and scrums that they have in contact centres; directors' meetings to promote some of the learning that's going on and how it's going to benefit their overall performance.\nPL: For Barbara and David it's less important to align with specific business objectives than to provide a framework, a business context. But without clear objectives how do you measure impact? Well they both agree that's all about gathering and sharing stories.\nDH: I think it's looking at where things are going really well and analysing what's going on here, how has this happened?\nPL: How do we get to here?\nDH: How are we getting here, yeah, and finding out actually people are doing some of this stuff off their own bat and being engaged. So okay how can we then not only celebrate that but sow the seeds in places where it's not going so well.\nPL: Yes but the whole process is more sophisticated isn't it than it ever used to be and more subtle in terms of how you're evaluating it and what it's actually bringing to your organisation? And what I'm interested in is how you capture those stories of getting from A to Z and share that because that must surely be part of the process mustn't it?\nBT: So to give you an example of one of the techniques that we use we get people to draw a graph for three or six or twelve months and say what are the things that are dragged down or enhanced performance, articulate what those are and then that's when people start talking about their story. So they might say, 'Oh I watched a fantastic TED talk and it really helped reframe X, Y, Z. Or I had a conversation with a peer. And that's how you surface some of their stories. And then what we do is we go a little bit further because we like stories to be much more user-centred rather than stories that's driven out from the centre. So we say then, 'How did that impact you? How did that contribute to X, Y and Z?' And we'll zone in on that particular sequence of events and we'll have that as a user story that we can talk about learning in a 70, 20, 10 frame.\nPL: And how do you then distribute that?\nBT: We have an informal system where we're able to upload videos, or we might show them, well we do advocate showing them within the classroom experience as well, so it might be that you're talking about a particular theme, wouldn't it be great that you can then bring in a video story about how someone has developed in this way. So it's to think about how you can use it in a number of different guises.\nPL: And selling this approach at every level of the organisation can make the difference between success and failure.\nBT: If we create the tools and we support people with the tools to help them with this the missing bit is line manager support. So I've been in situations where I've walked past someone who was looking at, it just so happened to be a TED talk and someone said, 'Oh you've got the time to be doing that haven't you got a job to do?'\nPL: That must have made you sigh!\nBT: Well it did make me sigh because it's to be applauded that anyone would want to take out time when everyone's incredibly time poor to want to look at something to help them do something better but if you don't create a parallel culture to support that then that's an absolute pitfall.\nPL: Just a couple of years ago Virgin Media L&D was 80% face to face - not any more!\nDC: We've gone on a big transformation to take on board a lot more digital because a lot of our learnings, particularly in some of those volume contact centre places that I talked about are used to an instant search and finding an instant solution plus they\ndon't have a lot of time off the phones because we want them talking to our customers and serving our customers. So we've had to build bite-size learning because that's what they've asked for. So we do a lot more videos; we do a lot more animations; we do a lot more infographics, stuff that they consume in two to three minutes, between calls with customers, can just upskill themselves on any challenges that they're facing throughout the day as well.\nPL: So you're tracking all that obviously about who's doing what, how do you encourage them to do it?\nDC: Ah ha it's a good question. So we encourage through trying to get off on the right foot to start with. So when people are inducted we talk a great deal about the learning that we want them to do but we also talk about the options available to them, the career paths that are there for them. So if you took my own function for instance it's a learning function, around - I don't know the exact figures - but around 70% of the people that work in our learning function started with us as a contact centre agent or a salesperson or a technician or an apprentice, which is just fabulous. So we are all about internal growth and a lot of what we do is get them to think about their career paths and where they want to go longer term.\nPL: That's interesting okay so they see the wins for themselves as well as the wider organisation. Is there an argument that self-directed learning generally benefits the individual sometimes at the expense of the organisation?\nDC: Yeah I don't disagree with that, yeah absolutely. There are times, and you can look back through some of the tracking that we've done over the years of some of our programmes where we sent people on things like MBAs and the programmes that they wanted to do and shortly afterwards they've left. And many organisations will have the same story and actually that's a failing for us as an organisation because 1) there's nothing wrong with they going on that programme but have we actually asked the question as to how much it's going to benefit us as well as them because that's what the key is to really successful learning it's something that's going to drive business performance and enhance the individual in the way that they work.\nPL: So how does that work then if an individual goes to a line manager and says 'I want to do x,' are there protocols around that sort of questioning now?\nDC: Historically no, yes there are now. So previously it was very much there's a budget that each division has and you kind of dip into the budget and if someone says yes, happy days! Now we have a lot more governance around that.\nPL: When it comes to that idea of drawing people in and encouraging this self-directed element of learning David and his team constantly monitor how individual learning elements are going down, be it video, infographic or whatever. And they tweak their output as that data comes in.\nDC: It's all about how well they're landing so we'll look at user stats; we'll look at time on a site, so we have some great videos that are three to five minute in length, some five minute videos really are the key ones that we first launched and when we launched them out there they were used and lots of people were going on to them but everybody started switching off at about three minutes 20, so no one watched\nthem to the end. So why are we producing a five minute video that nobody's going to get to the end to. So we'll go back and we'll go, 'Okay let's refine that and if there's some great points in that last minute and a half let's draw them in so they're into a three minute video and we'll time it.\nPL: Interesting so analytics are key.\nDC: Hugely.\nPL: Let's talk a bit more about measuring outcomes from this how do you do that?\nDC: So a lot of it is based on the individual programmes that we're building so we don't have a set of generic measurements for L&D that are, here's our success measures as such, what we'll do is for each programme that we build we'll set the success measures for that up front. We'll say, 'Okay what's our target where do we want to get to? And what do we think this learning intervention can do?' So if it's NPS is currently at 25% and we want to get to 35% is learning going to get us there? I can tell you now no! But maybe learning can get us 1% of the way. So we'll say, 'Okay let's see if we can get 1% of the way.'\nPL: So you are setting targets?\nDC: And we'll track on that. Absolutely we set targets for ourselves and we don't always reach them, we're realistic about that but we learn from when we haven't reached them.\nPL: Yeah how tough is that because it's quite tricky isn't it designing those things and setting... I mean it's a bit of a guessing game isn't it setting a target?\nDC: Yeah.\nPL: And obviously if you set them too low then it's meaningless.\nDC: Yeah absolutely. It is very much a guessing game but one of the things that I would stress we've brought into our learning culture is, and a phrase that I use all the time is embrace failure. So we miss targets all the time.\nPL: But that's okay with management?\nDC: And I'm okay with that yeah but the whole management might not be as pleased with it but as long as we can see that we're then looking to take that information of where we've missed and build on it and improve for the future then that's the positive step. For many, many years we had no targets, many of our learning programmes didn't have set learning objectives in them, so actually being able to measure anything was non-existent. So we're a giant step from where we were and management are accepting of that because we're very lucky that we're an organisation that's got a culture of innovation, creativity, challenging the norm. So sometimes we get things wrong because that's kind of the organisation that we are as long as we learn from it then that's positive.\nPL: Great but what about the pitfalls and when you're walking that tightrope between hands on and hands off there will be pitfalls.\nBT: If it's left as a wild west approach, by that I mean that you don't provide help people with the context, if you don't help people perhaps with a framework in which they can access things, if the experience is really poor and people are having to click 50 times to access self-directed then what you just do is you just switch people off and of course we're adults it's absolutely fine for people to go and look at things in their own time which might not have the organisational context but in some curricular areas, if you take safety as an example, you want it to be very tailored based on the needs of the business. So the pitfalls are if you make it hellish for people then guess what they're going to go outside and do those things.\nDH: The pitfalls are around how we label it, so if we label it as the next big thing then it's not going to work; the other thing didn't work so why would this thing work?\nPL: So is the trick not to label it at all, you don't call it anything?\nDH: Yeah absolutely. We've spent a lot of time basically saying we control learning. We'll control what you train in. So it is pushing against a tide of all those years of control around that. In some organisations we've allowed people to abdicate their development tools.\nPL: All a bit paternalistic.\nDH: Absolutely and people come to events, whether it's online, whether it's face to face, in a passive way expecting to have something done to them rather than involving and engaging in a lot of organisations.\nPL: Harnessing everyone's innate natural curiosity sits at the heart of a self-directed learning culture but as Virgin's David Chivers happily admits L&D has to keep learning too.\nDC: We get it wrong all the time. I guess the best example of us getting it wrong is we launched a load of online videos for our technical community, so these are engineers that dig up the roads and lay the cable that allows us to connect to our customers and these were brilliant videos, I mean they were amazing because we built them all ourselves as these brilliant animated videos of people talking about how the network works and faults that could go wrong, and put them all out there and made a big song and dance of it, got into all these meetings and the engineers came back and said, 'these are great. These are really good. We love these. We can never watch them.'\nPL: Why.\nDC: We said to ourselves why, yeah. Because they're in vans driving around on the road so how can they watch a video? So they said, 'Do you know what would be great is if you could turn these into podcasts.' So now we do a series of podcasts that our engineers can listen to.\nPL: Audio podcasts?\nDC: Yeah absolutely, that they can listen to in the van when they're moving between customers. So that's an example of us being directed by the learner as to the type of solution we provide as well.\nPL: The CIPD has fact sheets on a whole range of people topics, check out the ones on digital learning and learning methods for places to start plus there's a mooc platform FutureLearn where there are two self-directed online courses if you'd like to dive a little deeper.\nNext month productivity - how do top tier organisations get such great performance out of their people?

      "summary": "The practice of organisational design and development is changing and its profile is growing in the world of work and HR. Organisations are looking to OD experts - and sometimes HR professionals with only limited OD expertise - to help them resolve the many and varied challenges they face. But there's confusion about what OD is and some questionable truths about OD often go unchallenged. Together those issues can create significant organisational risk.\nIn this episode, we talk to OD experts Dr Naomi Stanford, Sadie Sharp, Gary Cookson and Warren Howlett about how OD is changing, what it can do and the role that HR can play.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:18:27\nTranscript\nGary Cookson: Say you met me at a party and said, \"What do you do Gary?\" and I said, \"I work in OD,\" you'd say, \"What the hell's that?\" and you'd be right, and how do you explain it? I'm not sure you can.\nPhilippa Lamb: Could you explain what OD is?\nGC: You could say that my role is to help organisations change and organisations improve, but then the follow-up question would be and how do you do that? And there's no way in a couple of minutes that I'd be able to keep your attention and avoid you going off to talk to somebody else at that party.\nPL: That's Gary Cookson he's in HR with years of organisational design and development experience and he's right there's a lot of confusion about OD, what it is, what it does. In the early days it was mostly academic territory. There was really very little out there in the way of understandable text or tools that practitioners could use. Now though that is all changing and OD is evolving fast, driven by all the other changes affecting work and the workplace. Here's Warren Howlett he's the CIPD's head of content.\nWarren Howlett: OD some people might say is driven by the massive shifts that we've seen in the workplace. We've seen it in automation of production; we've seen it in the services sector, now in the white collar workplace. We're seeing automation and a cognitive process automation of white collar jobs and we're potentially starting to move into the exponential part of the change curve and it's no wonder that organisations rate building the organisation of the future as their top priority in recent business surveys.\nPL: So that's driving interest in this as a field whilst in the past it's been a very academic discipline now as you say it's coming much more onto the ground in organisations of all sorts.\nWH: It definitely has changed. I think one of the most interesting things that has evolved in organisation design and development is a greater availability of good information, good guidance, good resources and tools for organisation design and development. So there's an opportunity for people who are not necessarily specialists to get involved in organisation design and development.\nPL: And educate themselves.\nWH: Yes.\nPL: Warren is very focused on all this right now because the CIPD thinks that OD is even more important now than it's ever been. But do organisations themselves actually know that and how much do they understand about how to use OD. Sadie Sharp is a business transformation consultant. Her work is all about helping organisations redesign how they operate. Now like Gary she has a lot of on the ground experience with a very wide range of corporate and public sector clients. I\nasked both of them how OD works. So as an OD consultant how does the process usually work?\nSadie Sharp: Obviously the best level to be brought in at is when they are trying to say we want to change direction, we know we need to change but we're not quite sure how to do that.\nPL: And the worst?\nSS: The worst is, we've done this come on in and help us make it work, which is kind of putting the plaster over it really.\nGC: I'm Gary Cookson and I'm the director of Epic HR.\nPL: So when organisations come to you what sort of tasks do they tend to ask you to organise for them?\nGC: Well when I was in house as an HR and OD practitioner it tended to be larger scale OD projects. So I worked for 12 years at a housing association. I was head of HR there and some of the large scale OD projects that I dealt with in that time would have been organisational restructures, business process reengineering work, a move of head office location and consolidation of a lot of different offices into one, culture change and embedding new values and merger of two organisations and a wholesale change to terms and conditions. So that's just a flavour of some of the things.\nPL: So what sort of tasks do organisations have in mind when they call you in specifically?\nSS: Usually it's triggered by your typical areas of pain such as having to shave a significant amount of money off their operating budgets, or there's been quite a lot of transformation in the sector in terms of competitors, a significant shift in operating technology platforms, those sorts of things. So they're normally brought upon them by a change in external circumstances or finances.\nGC: So sometimes you're lucky enough to have a burning platform and if you have then that galvanises the organisation to some degree and enables everybody to get behind the particular change that you're trying to drive and bring into the organisation. But where you haven't got that...\nPL: You've got a cold start.\nGC: Yeah where you've got a cold start and you're doing something because you think it's a good or the right thing to do that becomes quite difficult to try and build enough momentum and get that guiding coalition together to try and establish a real foothold for change.`\nSS: Yeah so normally what I will do when I'm particularly managing a large organisation design project is spend the first probably four to six weeks doing nothing other than just getting to know the business.\nPL: And how do you do that?\nSS: So I literally immerse myself in the business.\nPL: Physically?\nSS: Physically immerse myself in the business. So I've done some work with tarmacking firms where I've actually gone out on the front line and learnt how to tarmac the roads and operate the machinery.\nPL: That's a useful skill.\nSS: Absolutely it did me wonders on my driveway.\nPL: At what stage do you get to the point where you start designing a strategy, a way forward?\nSS: So I wouldn't even start designing until I have tried to spend quite as much time as possible with mid-level managers because the challenge is if you start designing and you come in with those preconceptions in your head around this is what the organisation needs it shows, on one level or another and the mid-level managers say, \"Well you've made your mind up already what's the point anyway, you're going to do it to me!\"\nPL: So they feed into the process.\nSS: They do absolutely.\nPL: You draft up ideas.\nSS: So you draft up so a lot of the approach I tend to take with large organisations is collaborative working groups, quantitative surveys, telephone interviews, those sorts of things, as well as actually sitting alongside and doing a week in the life of senior managers, for example. But the reason why I do that is if the high level boardroom in the business and the chief execs and the management team are saying, \"This is the state of our business; these are the problems we have; this is how ready our people are for this kind of a change; it's really being able to shine a true mirror up to those perceptions because sometimes they're on point and other times actually there is a massive chasm between the boardroom's view of that and the front line realistic, pragmatic, view of that, shall we say.\nPL: And how about measuring success, measuring outcomes?\nGC: It depends what you're trying to achieve. I've cited five or six different projects that I've been involved in but they'd all have different success criteria so I don't think there are common success criteria because it's highly specific and contextual.\nPL: But in terms of expectations, management expectations of what a successful OD process looks like what do they tend to ask you for?\nGC: They tend to ask for metrics that you can measure before and after and they will tend to be things like engagement rates, they might be things like attrition rates, absence rates, so some of the more traditional HR indicators. But then it's okay to get those and you will have those bits of data and as an HR director it's fine to have those but that's not enough to measure the success of the OD initiative, so you need to look at other things too and have like a balanced scorecard approach.\nPL: What sort of things?\nGC: Financial measures, productivity measures, performance measures, as well as the HR measures.\nPL: Skipping lightly over the very difficult part of implementation because obviously that's going to vary from organisation to organisation, what do your clients expect from you in terms of outcomes, because obviously one of the sacred cows of OD is that 70% of the interventions actually do nothing or indeed can create harmful outcomes, what do they expect from you though?\nSS: I think the biggest thing that a lot of organisations will expect from OD these days is to see a marked change in the way that the organisation feels as well as looks.\nPL: And how do you measure that?\nSS: Exactly and again I know measuring the effectiveness of OD interventions is always a hot topic and I guess the challenge here is sometimes trying to manage their expectations, saying, \"You came to me saying that your organisation isn't as effective as it needs to be because it feels like it's broken, because it feels like there's conflict, it feels like the culture is wrong and you've got anecdotal stories that will support that so it's not completely in the air but you have almost feelings and perceptions-based evidence that brought you to me so therefore don't discard that feelings and perceptions-based information after the OD.\"\nPL: Do clients have expectations of measurable financial outcomes\nSS: Yes most of the time, as I say, because it is often triggered by the need to reduce operational cost, rightly or wrongly that is often the expectation.\nPL: And is OD in a position to say, yes we can do that?\nSS: I think OD is certainly in a position to say, I can help you achieve that but actually whether or not these things bed in, whether or not the processes succeed, all of those sorts of things, it requires ongoing management. So I think this is the other thing with a lot of OD from an external consultancy perspective it's really important that when you're going in to do that with your client you do it with them because what you don't want is obviously the second that you leave that it's like, well it's done now we can just go back to business as usual. So rather than having to do the old change approach of unfreeze, change and then refreeze and we'll be safe for the next five or six years, everything is moving away too quick to be able to do that they need to learn to embrace change as the constant.\nPL: Early in her career Dr Naomi Stanford worked for big multinationals like Price Waterhouse, BA, Marks and Spencer and Xerox, now she's recognised internationally as a leading OD thinker, practitioner and author. Now when we met I asked her about tech which is now playing an increasingly interesting role in the field.\nNaomi Stanford: So for example if you have good organisational data on people's capabilities, their pay scales, who they report to, you can then start feeding that data into manipulable form so that if you say we want to downsize 10% in Coventry and relocate people to somewhere else what would that look like in terms of spend, in terms of people's reporting lines, in terms of the capabilities that we would need to develop? And it really speeds up the process and allows you to model different\nscenarios so you can say, we want to downsize in Coventry, but you might say, but maybe we could also downsize in Bristol and then you can compare the two.\nPL: As you say the outcomes you get from that depend on the quality of the data you feed into it,\nNS: Correct that's right yes.\nPL: But I mean I must say I was surprised that hadn't been going on already because it seemed like a common sense use of technology but you also told me about something which I hadn't thought of which was the idea that you could model specifics around individual people and their networks. Tell me a bit about that.\nNS: That's right. So there is a lot of work going on on social network mapping and organisational network mapping. Now you can map, and the technology is sophisticated on this, by tracking voicemail, email, text messaging and what have you from one organisational individual to another, so you can build up very complex networks of individuals who they're interacting with. And there is some method, I don't quite know how they do it, to filter out the football conversations and just make the work conversations.\nPL: So this rests on the idea that if you move Helen from job role A to job role B she'll lose the network she currently uses in job role A because it won't necessarily be relevant so she won't be as effective, and then what, it then moves to what can the organisation do to assist her to build a new network?\nNS: Yes well there are a couple of things if you're looking at specific individuals which inevitably it boils down to at some point in a design, although I do try and emphasise roles not people, if you start to say, well would Helen be better than George in this post? Then you can start to look at the networks and then you can start to say, well if she's been here x number of years and has built up that extensive network in the organisation and to contacts outside is it going to be useful in the role we're thinking of putting her in? Has she got the skills and capabilities to develop another network as quickly? As soon as you disrupt someone's network you've disrupted their ability to act in the role. You can't automatically assume that because someone is good in one job they're going to be good in even a similar job because that doesn't take into account the network they have to have to do the job.\nPL: I think this is really interesting, the question it immediately flags in my head though is ethics, because this draws on very personal data doesn't it, and the willingness to give it.\nNS: That's right. You can actually do some of the work just by wandering round, seeing who's talking to people or seeing what's going on.\nPL: Observation.\nNS: Yes that's right.\nPL: And right now as the CIPD develops its professional standards framework for the HR community OD is set to play a very significant role in that roadmap. Here's Warren again\nWH: As the CIPD we're the professional body for all of the people profession, and not just HR, so OD and D's increasingly important for us as an organisation, it's one of our most popular areas for information resources. I think what's also really interesting is that we're starting to see perhaps broader interest in organisation design and development than we've had in the past.\nPL: I think what we're still finding is that there is a huge amount of confusion about what OD and D actually is and where it lives in terms of responsibility for driving it, what are your thoughts on that?\nWH: I think as we think about people professionals more broadly, let's take HR generalists for example, HR generalists are very often the gatekeepers of data around people within their individual business unit and also connecting that to the organisation. They often have a really good knowledge around the system within their business unit from a people perspective and then how that connects with other systems within the organisation. So if you're an organisational design specialist you might be coming into the organisation or already be in the organisation and have the knowledge skills and behaviours of that profession but it's actually within parts of the HR function that there are individuals who can best enable and support that organisation design professional in doing their job. So there's an important synergy I think between the two that often gets perhaps misunderstood and it's not a competition between one or the other, they need to work together.\nPL: And obviously in the real world, in smaller organisations particularly and in straitened financial times for everyone often there is no OD specialist in the room is there, it's HR who are expected to meet those objectives?\nWH: I think that is a harsh reality and it may be the HR person that's having to get involved in those types of activities.\nPL: So a real area of focus for HR in terms of developing themselves?\nWH: Absolutely and that's reflected in how we're thinking about our new professional standards framework.\nPL: Yeah.\nWH: So this is a big change for us, we are building the professional standards framework for the future of the profession. It's been a couple of years of work in the making and what we've identified is that organisation design and development needs to be a greater area of focus for us moving forward. So it will be its own specialism area within the professional standards framework on its own.\nPL: Yeah that's interesting. So much more emphasis on OD and D and when is that coming to pass?\nWH: So we are drafting the standards at this point in time, working with experts in the relevant fields and pressure-testing them with a small audience. We'll be going out to a broader audience across the summer and then looking to launch towards the end of the calendar year.\nPL: So in terms of the new professional standards framework obviously it's work in progress right now but what can we expect in broad terms?\nWH: So within the context of the professional standards framework organisation design and development will have an area of specialism that's similar to how we focus on HR and L&D today so it's a big shift for us as the CIPD and as the CIPD we will need to support and enable organisation design and development professionals so we've got a whole schedule of work around additional information resources, events, training and development that we are scheduled to build over the next 12 to 18 months.\nPL: So that's very good news isn't it for all those people listening to this who are sitting in organisations thinking, I don't have budget necessarily for an OD external practitioner to come in and help me do this but if they do from what you're saying it's going to equip them to work better with that person.\nWH: Absolutely. What we're not looking to do in organisation design and development as the CIPD is to in any way replace or displace what organisation design and development specialists do in their roles and what we would like to do is to raise awareness more broadly across the people profession of some aspects of organisation design and development so people professionals can better enable and support better decisions about organisation design and development.\nPL: The OD residential summer school is running in London this month and it's in Edinburgh in September. Warren will be hosting an OD conference in October so if this does sound like something you need to know more about book your place and check out the fact sheets on OD and D on the website in the meantime.\nIf you'd like an OD qualification to shine up your resume, the CIPD offers short courses like the Advanced Award in OD and D. Now handily you can do that one in modules throughout the year or fast track it in five consecutive days.\nThanks to Warren and this month's other guests: Sadie Sharp, Gary Cookson and Dr Naomi Stanford.\nThanks for listening.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

      "summary": "The business and ethical case for diversity is clear and well established, and today we’re seeing notable progress on gender. However, research shows that we’re still not seeing the same pace of change in racial equality at work. While one in eight of the working-age population is from a BAME background, this group still only holds one in sixteen of the top management positions. Despite governmental and business focus, we are failing to make a meaningful and lasting impact.\nSo what is holding organisations back? In this episode we hear clips from an event in which senior HR professionals discuss why they believe progress remains slow and why we find it so difficult to talk about race. We also hear from television broadcaster June Sarpong MBE and CIPD’s Membership Director David D’Souza as they discuss what organisations and HR can do to support and encourage change.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:26:56\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: So welcome to the podcast and today it is the second episode of our diversity series. Now last time we looked at unconscious bias this time we're getting our teeth into an issue that is more taboo and that is why are we comfortable talking about gender in the workplace but not race?\nNow in ten years' time nearly 20% of the UK workforce will be black, Asian or of minority ethnic origin but we have to ask ourselves how well they'll do at work compared to their white colleagues because right now a third of black employees feel that discrimination is undermining their career progression. That is according to the CIPD's own research.\nToday we're going to hear some views recorded at a recent CIPD forum where a range of experts got together to talk about the BAME work, and it's worth saying at this point that that forum was conducted under the Chatham House rules and the clips we're going to play you we recorded them afterwards which is why we're attaching names to them.\nNow I've got two guests with me to discuss the clips, that's David D'Souza, CIPD's own membership director, and June Sarpong MBE, TV presenter and author of a great new book called Diversify. Thank you for being with us.\nJune as I said to you earlier I started reading your book last week, I'm really enjoying it and I was struck by a term that you coined which is 'the others', do you want to explain that?\nJune Sarpong: Yes of course. So the reason why I decided to look at the various disenfranchised groups that I look at in the book and call them 'other' was because I think a lot of the time we use quite extreme language when it comes to this issue and I think most people are in the middle, which is they're comfortable with people that remind them of themselves. And everybody has an 'other'. And so I think if we can look at it in these sorts of terms then we take the shame out of it and that way people can be honest and address their unconscious bias, address where their limiting beliefs are and then hopefully start to change as individuals.\nAnd I think that's really important because when we use really extreme words like racism, which let's be real does exist, I'm not one of these people that thinks it doesn't exist, it's real, but I would categorise racism as some of the people that we saw marching at Charlottesville. Do you see what I mean?\nPL: Sure.\nJS: That is what I class as overt racism. I think most people are somewhere in the middle which is just they discriminate in a way which is unintentional and in a way that they don't want to. But we've all been conditioned to think a certain way, so\nunless you are somebody that's exceptional chances are you have these sorts of beliefs.\nPL: Well the book as I say is interesting obviously it's a wide sphere, you cover age, power, class, it's really interesting.\nJS: Disability.\nPL: It is a really interesting read, for the purposes of today we're just talking about BAME but I think you'll be interested in the clips we've got and the voices you'll hear are Pamela Hutchinson, she's from Bloomberg; diversity consultant Frank Douglas and HS2's Mark Lomas. Let's kick off with their thoughts on why gender seems easier to talk about than BAME.\nFrank Douglas: Every while man knows a white woman, which is to say that women are part of the C suite's personal orbit. They go home, there's a wife, a daughter, a mother, a grandmother. At work women make up an increasingly larger part of the workforce. On the other hand with black and Asian, ethnic minority staff, there are very few BAME's in professional orbit of most C suite executives and quite obviously there's probably even less in their personal orbit when they go home. That creates discomfort and that also starts enabling stereotypes.\nPamela Hutchinson: I think we find it easier to talk about gender rather than BAME diversity, well for starters I think BAME in itself is a difficult concept to even get your head around. I mean what does it really mean and who does it apply to? And I think we get so caught up in the language that we find it difficult to talk about for fear of offending, whereas gender you've got male and female and that's pretty much it.\nMark Lomas: How often do you walk into a room of senior HR professionals and see a black or Asian man? Quite unlikely. How often do you walk into the board and see black or Asian people represented there, particularly in the sector that I'm from which is construction, infrastructure, engineering? Very unlikely. So those are the reasons why we find it difficult, it's because there aren't enough of those people in those rooms to normalise the presence, to normalise difference and make it easy to talk about.\nPL: So Pamela says gender's easier to talk about than race, just generally easier. I mean obviously gender isn't the binary issue it used to be in the past but it's perhaps less complicated than race and it is interesting how many people I meet and you will meet too who actually don't know what BAME means. Do you find that?\nDavid D'Souza: Yes. I think it's one of these areas where unless you step towards it, unless you express a genuine interest and unless you care enough to do that it can just seem rife with complicated terms and I know that there are a number of times that people may challenge the usage of BAME I think the use of the wording around\n'other' is a really interesting one because it helps you recognise that there is difference but actually makes it less jargony in some ways. But language is definitely a barrier to conversation.\nPL: And anxiety about getting it wrong?\nJS: Yeah and I think also one of the things we have to be quite honest about is that where race is concerned, if you look at the history there's been all sorts of horrific structures that have been put in place and I think the problem with race per se is you also have to look at how people are conditioned. So in western countries white people are taught to believe that they are superior to people of a different race, whether you like it or not, even if it's not overt just because white is the standard for normal that means that's what you're going to get. So first of all you're dealing with the fact that people have been conditioned to have beliefs around superiority and inferiority and then the other piece which is really important, particularly when we get to the men is the fact that men of colour are seen as the primary source of fear in our society.\nSo that's another thing. So number one, without even knowing it when your image of a scientist, you think of scientist, you think white man. When you think of leader you think white man. When you think of anything to do with leadership, power or influence you think white man. And there's a hierarchy and perhaps next is white woman, elite white woman anyway and then it goes on and on and on. And usually people of colour are at the bottom of that.\nSo if we get into the workplace our idea of who is actually capable of running a business, of growing a company, of strategising and so on and so on, without even realising our idea is usually not a person of colour and I think that's why it's really important to start challenging these limiting beliefs. But we have to understand where it's coming from.\nPL: Yeah I mean Frank's point about we all know white woman, I mean I was thinking about this on the train on the way here this morning and thinking is there anyone in the country who doesn't know a white woman and there probably isn't is there?\nDDS: I don't have the stats on that but I'd be quite comfortable going out on a line and saying that there isn't.\nPL: Which is interesting because when you think how many people do not know someone who doesn't look like them and there'll be millions of people who don't know.\nJS: Yes we did some recent polling on that particularly issue and what we found was a third, 34% of British people do not have a single friend from a different ethnic or cultural background.\nPL: That's a big number isn't it?\nJS: That's a big number. It's probably more actually.\nPL: Organisational fit is something I wanted to talk about and I was going to ask you David about this because this has been a big thing and HR has promoted this idea of bringing people into organisations who are right for the organisation, has that got a role to play here though because is that slightly becoming shorthand for low risk organisations, people who are kind of like us, people like the people we've already got?\nDDS: If you do it lazily then absolutely, that's part of the problem. But I think if you do it mindfully and if you go, actually what are we trying to create here? We are trying to create people who are respectful of others, who want to value people's thoughts rather than their backgrounds, then actually it's a really positive thing because that's what you can aim for in terms of fit. But if what you say is actually we'd just like more like some of the last ones that we had, where you know if you profile...\nPL: More of the same.\nDDS: ...if you did more of the same for the FTSE 100 you would end up with essentially entrenching some of the problems that we know we have currently.\nPL: I'm interested because obviously June you talk a lot about the business case for this some sectors of employment are better than others and actually I was thinking about yours on the way here too and thinking that the media quite a long time ago got its head around the fact that they needed non-white presenters for commercial reasons.\nJS: No as somebody who works in the media I think my industry talks a good game but in reality it's terrible.\nPL: Well that's what I mean because people in front of cameras you get more diversity but you walk into any broadcast organisation it's a sea of white middle class people isn't it?\nJS: Yes I totally agree it really is.\nPL: So that was the point I was trying to make really that some organisations are in the foothills of understanding the commercial imperative but they haven't actually embraced it fully.\nJS: Yes 100%. And I think also back to what David you were saying about more of the same, I think one of the things that companies need to look at, particularly B to C businesses is the talent pipeline. So if you know you are sourcing talent from only Russell Group universities straightaway you know what you're getting. That's more of the same and actually maybe it's looking at new ways and in fact I've got an article about this on your blog, maybe it's looking at new ways of sourcing talent. So where are we getting our talent from and where are the groups that we haven't even tapped into and shown our industry exists? And I think that's really important for any leader, for any HR professional. It's the thing, okay normally we look at Russell Group university students, normally we go to the same headhunters etc. you know what we're going to throw that out of the window and we're going to say, \"We want this kind of person, come and we will train you ourselves within our organisation,\" because even if you have people of colour or you have people with disabilities and they've still be educated in the Russell Group system that in itself is still kind of more of the same, so we also want diversity of thought.\nPL: All right let's move on to causes and listen to some more clips about what's holding up progress.\nPH: I think one of the things that holds back progress is that we're not honest, we don't have real truthful conversations. Everyone is skirting around the issue, again\nbecause of fear of offending or being accused of being racist and so we don't really get to the heart of the topic.\nFD: The UK at its most basic is a class society and so we're much more comfortable talking about class. I always find it interesting whenever I read the newspaper if there's ever a crime story or anything the first paragraph always has the price of the person's home to establish where they are in the social setting. But race is something that we just are very uncomfortable with and we don't touch it, and many C suite senior executives don't know what to call black people, I mean I've had CEOs ask me, \"Do I call them black? Is it people of colour? Is it coloured?\" I've even had someone say. So they're not even sure how to start the conversation. So it's a muscle that they've never exercised. Now if you can't even start a conversation about an issue then you're going to have no chance of addressing the issue.\nML: Two things, transparency and accountability. If you don't understand what you're doing and what the effect it has then you've got no hope of ever changing anything. Some of it is wilful ignorance. I just don't want to know because then I might have to do something difficult. And when it comes round to accountability, accountability is not only you get rewarded for this, you get the stick for that, but it's accountable for doing something different. Have you done the same thing for 20 years and it not worked? Well if you have you should do something different because blatantly it's not working. So for me transparency is very key, accountability is key. And again those are two things at senior levels of the organisation when you talk about diversity you will see a lot of people go, \"Well you're talking about positive discrimination then.\" No, no one's talking about that. And I think one of the primary problems when you try and have that conversation is this idea that we live in a meritocracy. Actually I'm not from the UK, I'm from Bermuda and I've never seen a culture which is so interested in fairness and yet so completely oblivious to the fact that it's not a meritocracy at all.\nSo that makes it very difficult because a logical outcome of believing it's a meritocracy is that those people who are different and don't benefit from the sponsorship, the networking etc. and don't make it through, aren't as good. And therefore you get into a pity model and I think that's why the change is difficult. But transparency and accountability are key to the change.\nPL: That is interesting isn't it?\nJS: Yes.\nPL: I mean I think it builds on the point that you're making about Russell Group universities, this idea that we kid ourselves that we're living in a meritocracy.\nJS: Mm very much so and we're not. And also I think it's about valuing different skillsets and realising that actually certain groups bring something else that's equally valuable to a first or a 2:1 or whatever.\nDDS: And the challenge about admitting that it's not a meritocracy is that's a threat to the people who are traditionally successful because it means they have to admit to themselves that they didn't get there purely on merit but actually there are attributes that maybe where they grew up, maybe the people that they knew, it may just be the\ncolour of their skin there determining that level of success and that is a threat to ego as much as anything else.\nPL: It's hard to believe isn't it? And you can discuss this with high achievers and it's the last thing they want to admit to - understandably, perfectly understandably, but it is there isn't it and we need to look that in the eye a bit more directly?\nDDS: Yeah I mean I'm regularly asked by our students how I got to be relatively successful in my career and my answer is I was born in one of the richest countries in the world, in a home county, went to a grammar school, I'm white-skinned and I'm a guy. That's quite a head start compared to lots of people and until we start admitting that to ourselves it's very difficult to confront the challenges to other people.\nPL: You were laughing when there was the talk about, \"How do we refer to people who aren't white-skinned?\" So come on tell us.\nJS: Yes, yes, first of all black is fine, it's nice, it's good, you can say the word 'black'. A lot of people are scared to say it.\nPL: Well when I was a small child you could not say that.\nJS: I know.\nPL: So the language changes doesn't it?\nJS: No but that was never black people that thought that, black people always liked the word 'black', white people were scared to say the word 'black'. So Philippa you can say black as can you David.\nDDS: Thanks.\nJS: You've just found out you are haven't you love!\nPL: I think I should explain at this point we've been having a conversation about David's ethnicity and he's discovered some interesting things about his own background.\nDDS: It's fluid, it's fluid.\nJS: He's ethnically fluid. So where black is concerned we can say that. Also I think in terms of what to call people sometimes you just have to ask as well and I think ask without the nervousness and the guilt attached to it, just ask.\nPL: So we did a series podcast last year about the experience of LGBTQ people in work and we did I think three or four largely drawing on people's own experiences and that was exactly the same conversation, it was about no one knows what to call me. No one knows how to say this stuff. They're terrified of using the wrong term. And so there's this distance, this chasm opens up, even amongst people who, with the best will in the world they just are terrified of screwing it up.\nJS: Yeah and I think sometimes you just have to ask.\nPL: Yeah that was exactly what most of those speakers said to just front up and ask.\nDDS: Yeah I think if you care enough about it you'll find a way to have those conversations. It's almost an easy get out to say, \"Well I wasn't quite sure of the\nlanguage, I wasn't quite comfortable so I just stayed away from it and left things as they were.\" If you want to be part of the solution you have to be part of the conversation.\nPL: Yeah well that's perfect actually that brings us on to what we should be doing. Let's hear again from our experts again at the forum.\nML: That's a good question you know what works it's really easy make a different decision.\nPH: Gosh I don't think anything has worked so far or else we wouldn't still be talking about this topic.\nML: A lot of organisations talk about mentoring. They talk about having a BAME development programme. I think the time for that has passed. That's been done for the last 15 years, has it changed anything? Maybe the power of one or two but again you walk into that boardroom has it worked? No it hasn't.\nFD: It's not easy and so what also is happening is that people are looking for easy solutions, looking for shiny objects, let's do blind CVs, let's do diverse panels and let's do unconscious bias training, and all they're doing is focusing on the medicine without actually having diagnosed is that stomach pain an ulcer, gas, food poisoning or whatever? And the medicine part is easy.\nML: Fixing the people doesn't work you actually have to fix the method by which you reach your decisions. And then that will change, that will change on its own. The women don't need fixing, the BAME people don't need fixing, the LGBT people don't need fixing, the disabled people don't need fixing. If all these people are finding your talent and your development and your resourcing process is problematic I would suggest logic dictates the problem is the process.\nPH: But I think things that can help, I think holding managers accountable for driving ethnic diversity is critical in the same way that we have done around gender and organisations have targets and goals in place, we should feel comfortable to do similar things around ethnic diversity. I also think that unless we're having real, honest conversations about diversity then it's very difficult to move the agenda forward and one of the things that we're doing in our organisation at Bloomberg is that we're having inclusion dialogues and those dialogues are about bringing people together on topics that are difficult and uncomfortable and sensitive and challenging. And we've started one on race and it was incredibly successful and it spearheaded a whole load of activities off the back of it.\nPL: David I wanted to ask you about this, because this is the nitty gritty isn't it for practitioners, do you agree with Mark that the time for mentoring and development programmes is over because a lot of organisations are just getting started, they think that's the way forward.\nDDS: I think the time for anyone thinking that's a holistic and effective solution in isolation is definitely over. Do I think they're bad things in and of themselves? Absolutely not but I think it's far too easy for organisations to select a few initiatives, put them on a PowerPoint slide and put them in the board report and not actually\ndeal with some of the root cause and some of the broader issues that are uglier, trickier, require more effort, energy and thought to walk towards.\nPL: So the sort of things like I was interested in those inclusion dialogues that\nPamela mentioned at Bloomberg's, what did you think?\nJS: It's great actually what Pamela is doing at Bloomberg is phenomenal, she's really leading the way in this space and they are getting results. I think in terms of what to do I don't think this stuff is difficult at all because the wonderful thing about inequality is you see what works for the few that are privileged. So we have a clear template in terms of what breeds success. So if we look at what we're doing for elite, white men in our society that tells us, oh in terms of untapping human potential these are the steps, let's just start doing that for everybody else. It's not complicated, it really isn't. We know we're giving them the right level of education at an early enough age, we know that once they get into our universities, again they are then developing the networks. And we know that once they are in organisations that they are being promoted at a rate that's fair - well not always - but they're being promoted. And so I think we know what works, let's just do the same for everyone else. And I think the wonderful thing about the world of work is this is where we can get this stuff right and we spend most of our time there and actually the benefits in terms of economically are quite clear, quite quickly.\nPL: So what do you want to see from employers? Do you want to see blind CVs?\nJS: No I don't think blind CVs are the way. I think what I want to see from employers is first to understand why this is necessary. Secondly to make sure that their organisations understand it too, because usually it's the mid-level that you get the problem, you're able to get the BAME talent through the door and then something happens at the mid-level and they hit a glass ceiling. So you really need to identify what's going on there or how do we change that so that those people are able to progress and we're actually able to retain that talent.\nPL: What about sponsors higher up the organisation?\nJS: That's important but the problem is usually the leadership isn't always the problem, usually the leadership wants to get this right, it's the mid-level that the problem happens at. So I think of course the leadership is important but you've got to make sure that the rest of the organisation also understands that it matters.\nDDS: I suppose my only challenge to that is that quite often leaders set the tone for the organisation. So if leaders genuinely show that they care, and they care enough not just to deal with it at a superficial level, or express support, but actually to go and then sort out the challenge at that middle level that's where you'll really make a difference.\nPL: Let's talk about regulation; because we've just had the audit on gender pay and the gap there, which produced fascinating results, well certainly fascinating from the point of view of a woman, should the government make it a statutory requirement for employers to publish data in the same way on ethnicity?\nJS: Yes.\nFD: I think we have to just not leave it to the best wishes and intentions of the organisations of what they're going to do. I think that we have to mandate that the ethnic pay gap is also published because unless we expose that and shine a light on it, it's not going to be addressed.\nPH: I absolutely believe that the government should start to make it a statutory requirement to publish data on ethnicity; I just can't see how else we're going to move this agenda forward. Organisations will be stuck in this space of feeling uncomfortable unless they are forced to do something about it.\nML: I'm not sure that would make a difference. If we were to do a race pay gap report it would just look worse because there are far less ethnic minorities at the top of organisations than there are women. Are companies going to rush to sign up to that? I don't think so. So I'm not sure that that is the solution. The solution will come from the customers, the clients, the external focus, who say we want to know or we're not buying your service, we're not using your service. That's when you will see real, real change.\nPH: We just need to do something because frankly I fear that my children will come into the workplace and we will still be in the same place.\nPL: That is a really grim thought isn't it, Pamela saying there that her kids are going to get to working age and it's going to be just like it is now. So she says yes we need mandatory reporting, so does Frank, Mark says no it's going to put employers off, what do you think?\nJS: I think we definitely need that. I think we need mandatory reporting in terms of pay but also in terms of progression because I think where BAME is concerned progression actually is an even bigger problem. So I think we definitely need that, we have to.\nDDS: I think the attention that gender pay gap reporting drew to a systemic sustained issue that was almost a scandal that we understood but didn't pay enough attention to, I think there's a similar thing happening here but actually probably on a more profound level. So I would wholeheartedly support it, I haven't actually checked out what the CIPD stance on this is yet.\nPL: We know what your stance is though!\nDDS: So apologies to anyone else in the organisation that I've now committed to it. But I absolutely think that the only way that you get attention paid to some of these things is to show the stark reality of them and it will be a good mechanic for that and I would actually like to see the reporting dealt with in a slightly more thorough and nuanced way than we had with gender pay gap reporting as we..\nJS: That's a good point.\nPL: What do you mean?\nDDS: So I think there were certain quirks with gender pay gap reporting, including things like people excluding partners or actually media, self-employed contractors, things like that.\nPL: Which is the bulk of the industry of course.\nDDS: Absolutely. Let's genuinely look at who the people that are being employed by organisations and what's the breakdown in payment for them and let's get right to the heart of those issues and also let's not let companies off the hook if this happens to be the case year after year. So there are challenges around from an HR practitioner's point of view, how some of those figures are put together but actually I think the more detail that we get so there is no question and there is no gap that an organisation can step into and go, oh but it's not quite like that, get people to publish it so we know it is quite like that and it is unacceptable.\nPL: And you think that data will drive the sort of societal change that Mark was talking about, contractors, consumers, clients saying, \"Well what are you doing about this?\" to the organisations they interact with?\nDDS: The media has a role to play and I think we saw that with gender pay gap. It made good headlines; good headlines make for good conversations and in fact having something, to use your word 'other', having actually slightly remote concepts of it that you can talk about the fairness of makes it sometimes a bit easier to have the conversations then and how they apply to your immediate surroundings.\nJS: That's so true, very true.\nPL: We're out of time but a really good discussion.

      "summary": "Recruitment is a fundamental process for every organisation. Get it right and it can strengthen company culture, improve productivity and performance, and positively impact wellbeing and diversity. Get it wrong and the negative effects can be far-reaching for individuals, teams and organisations.\nSo how do HR professionals ensure that their recruitment processes are fair and unbiased and so attract the best talent?\nIn this episode, we talk to three HR experts about the impact of unconscious bias on recruitment. We look at how unconscious bias can creep into to any decision-making process and offer advice on what HR and managers can do to address the effects of unconscious bias in their organisations, particularly at the point of recruitment.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:19:49\nTranscript\nAlasdair Scott: So at any given moment we're bombarded by around 11 million different insights or inputs into our brains.\nPhilippa Lamb: This is Alasdair Scott.\nAS: We can only really handle 40 of them at one time.\nPL: He's a business psychologist and inclusion specialist.\nAS: And so we use heuristics to manage that data and to manage those inputs. Now of course they can be really, really helpful, when we walk into a room we can see perhaps a blond person or a black man and we can put them in those boxes and that's nice. But those boxes are pretty biased and it comes from a very organic, natural place, because as human beings we're trying to make our lives easier.\nPL: Unconscious bias is the focus of this episode, the first in the two-part diversity series and recruitment is the starting point according to Ksenia Zheltoukhova who's Head of Research and Thought Leadership at the CIPD.\nKsenia Zheltoukhova: Our unconscious bias can create a certain environment in the organisation and we became to say that's normal so if people look around and they only see a particular type of person around them they begin to think that this is the kind of person that is successful in this organisation and therefore continue to conform with that type of norm furthering the lack of diversity in organisations.\nPL: And just in recruit that image.\nKZ: Exactly. This is why the interest in unconscious bias is very strongly linked to recruitment because this is the main source of new types of people in our organisations and if we fail to recruit for diverse candidates this is how diversity issues in organisations perpetuate.\nPL: So how does unconscious bias actually work?\nAS: I put it down as two different things you're either in the one up group or you're in the one down group, okay? The one up group, those individuals who perhaps are dominant, are in positions of power and the one down groups are those individuals who are either subject to any discrimination off the back of those individuals in the one up group. So people in the one down group are people like women, various sexual orientations, race that is not white. Now those individuals that a lot of the time are subject to our biases. Now it doesn't just stop there because actually there are other more interesting nuances in our biases that go beyond just these characteristics. So there are things like white pumps or shiny shoes, right? You look at me quite confused.\nPL: No I think I'm getting this it's stuff you don't like.\nAS: Stuff you don't like. The thing about this is where does that come from?\nPL: Now regardless of whether it's about shiny shoes or any other differentiator unconscious bias can work both positively and negatively.\nKZ: We can decide not to give someone an opportunity because we ascribe certain characteristics to them that they don't necessarily have, but that also means we can favour someone unfairly because we think they have positive characteristics, again that they don't necessarily hold.\nPL: And it's not only the obvious protected characteristics like race, gender, sexual orientation that we need to be aware of here.\nKZ: People may discriminate against someone just because they think in different ways or they think at a different pace, we recently published a guide on how to deal with neuro diversity in the workplace. So this is for example people who have Asperger's and similar. This is not traditionally what we've seen as a protected characteristic in terms of diversity and so the tests and training to deal with those types of biases may not be readily available but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything about it.\nPL: Well shall we turn this on the head then and look for solutions.\nAS: Yeah.\nPL: So starting at the beginning or this process, your ad, your shout out for people to join your organisation there's pitfalls right there aren't there with the language.\nAS: Absolutely.\nPL: Gendered language, stuff around asking for competitive and determined people tends to bring in male candidates.\nAS: Absolutely.\nPL: Lots of stuff around that?\nAS: Absolutely. It's really funny actually I was looking at a website last week and it was for a tech company and I was doing a bit of an audit on their attraction, one it's full of language that's incomprehensible and if you look at the kind of roles that they are advertising right now many of them are not in that sort of tech data space, many of them are recruiting into their people team.\nPL: So they don't need to be technical in their language?\nAS: Don't need to be technical in that language. Their technical, software skills which they are looking for so talent managers, L&D professionals, they're looking for a chief people officer at the moment too. Certainly it's alienating so that even that assumption that you're going to understand I guess what an SSIOS is, I've no idea what it is, it's ridiculous. Then you go into the imagery and the website. So it's a soft thing. So full of white men, white, middle-aged men. So if you're someone who's either an ethnic minority or you're a woman - this is a very ambitions start-up and they've missed the mark already.\nPL: And when you said all this to this client were they surprised?\nAS: I've not said it yet.\nPL: You haven't said it yet.\nAS: I'm sharpening the claws right now.\nPL: So you sort out the language in your job ad. Next you need to think hard about where you advertise because that choice can invite bias into the process too.\nKZ: Certain age groups may be more likely to use particular channels, especially social media. I think it's less of a problem now than compared to when we did the research a few years ago but still being aware of what type of candidate is most likely to come across your job advert is useful.\nPL: Okay the ad goes out applicants apply with their CVs but not so fast CVs are a very unreliable route to diversity.\nAS: What you don't know about me is my background is not creational psychology so my bread and butter is in the science of people at work and it's been long understood within that community that things like CVs and references are the least valid predictors of performance in the recruitment process because they've got their biases not just from the characteristics that you see, identifiable characteristics, but also the applicant's own manipulation of their experience as well and how they've positioned themselves, perhaps elevated their role as well.\nPL: So the embroidering aspects of CVs.\nAS: The embroidering. So personally if I was going to be quite blunt about it I don't think CVs should be used in a recruitment process period.\nPL: But people need some data don't they about their candidates?\nAS: You can get data about candidates but you can be a bit more smart about it. So you can be using scientific data in your recruitment process. So again going back to psychology you could start using things like measuring individual differences or beyond CV. So you can be looking at motivation, personality, your value sets.\nPL: On the other hand Ksenia argues there is good evidence that blind CVs do have merit. And we should probably explain for people who don't know what a blind CV is.\nAS: Yeah so a blind CV is basically that you kind of omit the CV process all together or you take away any identifying characteristics from the CV.\nPL: So no names.\nAS: No names, no addresses, no date of birth if you have one, no pictures, no nothing.\nKZ: And we found that anonymising Cvs is an effective intervention for increasing diversity in organisations and reducing bias in recruitment. So that's one of the things we recommend our practitioners do consider. Anonymised CVs on their own are not going to solve the problem but what you might consider is using CVs or anonymised CVs as a gateway.\nPL: A gateway to what exactly?\nKZ: Now you have to realise you won't solve all problems at once and so there is bigger work to be done by learning and development practitioners but also more broadly by people leaders in terms of how they foster the inclusive climate, inclusive culture in their organisations. And unconscious bias is just part of it. All types of\npeople, practices and policies send a message to employees on whether they would feel they will be included or not in that organisation. And so I would suggest that if that's not even a bigger task for the practitioners that they consider their strategies and approaches as a whole as well as focusing on unconscious bias training as a specific intervention.\nPL: Jon Dawson is HRD at Mandarin Oriental. He told me how they devised a very creative version of blind CVs for a big hotel recruitment drive.\nJon Dawson: Well I was opening a hotel and we had to recruit 250 people and what we actually did as a first recruitment event we actually hired an art gallery in Fitzrovia in London, it's a creative area and the brand was very creative and we actually hired this art gallery and we told all the line managers, what we're going to do is do a recruitment event and all you need to do is be here, at this time and this date and we'll bring the people and we'll go from there.\nPL: And just mingle.\nJD: And just mingle. Well the managers were actually expecting us to come with CVs to hand out. Some of the managers then, when we had no CVs said, \"Well how are we going to know about these people?\" and we said, \"Well what actually we want you to do is anyone that has a name badge is a guest and has come to find out more about this brand we're creating, anyone that doesn't have a name badge obviously works for Addition Hotels and we want you to mingle.\" And the first hand went up from the front office manager and he said, \"Well how do I know where they want to work and what experience they've got?\" and I said, \"Well that's the whole point.\"\nPL: Ask them?\nJD: \"All we want you to do is write down their name and get into some really engaging conversations.\" What some of the managers didn't know is the majority of the people and CVs that had first come through the door, had got no hospitality experience whatsoever. And what actually happened at that event, after all the invitees had gone, the managers were just so passionate, \"Wow, I spoke to Sarah, I spoke to John, they were fantastic and I can't wait to get their CV tomorrow morning.\" So when we did the wrap up and gave them the CV it was sort of, \"Wow they've never worked in hotels or hospitality before!\" and we said, \"Well if we'd have given you that CV first would you have considered them?\" \"Hmm probably not!\" That was one of the most successful events I ever did. There was around 150 people we invited to that event and the hire ratio was 78%.\nPL: And then that brings me to that thought that has been raised in the interviews we've done in this podcast were people saying you need to standardise interview questions and you need to do score card marking, is if you don't then that unconscious bias creeps right in even in the best intended things you find someone you like, that likeability thing creeps in and before you know it you're thinking, 'Yeah, yeah that's the girl for the job.' What do you think?\nJD: The model that we created from that talent event was very, very much...the first conversation was those natural conversations where you get that gut feeling, I really want this. But then when you look at how we want to make up that team you need\ndifferent characteristics and that's the second part of the interview process, so it wasn't just a case of a talent event and they've come in and got the job.\nPL: No I get that but you were from a much more standardised way after that\nJD: Yeah so when they actually came in we developed a competency framework around standardisation. And again there were two different interviews, the line manager then interviewed with a HR professional and then there was a final stage of the interview process which was the general manager or hotel manager. So the time to fill did take considerably longer but the results in the end were outstanding.\nPL: It's natural to gravitate towards people you gel with but there's good data to support the theory that employers hire people they like best on a personal level. So natural chemistry is a red flag. But how do you bias-proof your interview process?\nAS: So telephone interviews. So I like to call telephone interviews the voice of the recruitment world. You laugh so the telephone shows the voice, you don't see the person so you don't see any body language, you don't see any things that they're wearing, so of course you can't be biased. Of course you can! People's tone, their pitch, and particularly in the UK, their accent. And so again back to cultural programming, some accents we just don't like that much although there are some accents we really like. So, I forget where it was from but there were statistics that suggest that the majority of people in the UK find, I hate to say Scousers, the Liverpudlian accent, aggressive, unintelligent and untrustworthy.\nPL: And Geordies are the good guys.\nAS: Are the good guys. Or people from Inverness apparently as well.\nPL: Oh really ((laughs))\nAS: Yeah apparently ((laughs)). Now I'm from Inverness, I just wanted to say that.\nPL: So you're all good then.\nAS: But what happens, again it's implicit, people don't realise why do I have this regard for people from Liverpool? But that will put that person after that telephone interview firmly in the 'no' pile.\nPL: But of course face-to-face interviews are an ideal stage for our biases to play out on.\nAS: Crazy hair, Albert Einstein would go in the 'no' bucket.\nPL: Okay.\nAS: Long hair on a man, Richard Branson would go in the 'no' bucket. Blond women, Marissa Mayer would go in the 'no' bucket because people might think, 'Blond they look...'\nPL: Ditsy.\nAS: Ditsy. So these fantastic people I've just mentioned because of people's prejudices about half of amazing people would be disregarded by the recruitment process.\nPL: So avoid looking at likeability and, says Ksenia, ask everyone the same questions.\nKZ: So having a very structured set of questions that you ask candidates at further stages of recruitment so they all have a fair chance of performing well.\nPL: So is that standardised questions?\nKZ: Yeah that's it so you have an interview guide that makes sure you ask candidates the same questions across and also that you use the interview process to gather data and make decisions towards, rather than making the decision in the process.\nPL: There's a great fondness I think in all of us for the organic interview isn't there, the wide-ranging, let's see how it plays out, interview, full of pitfalls presumably?\nAS: Totally, absolutely. I'm split between this actually.\nPL: So the suggestion is you standardise questions, you mark them with score cards, so ideally you eradicate bias.\nAS: You're objective in that, it's an objective process. Now there's pitfalls in each solution because you do want to get a sense of the individual and the personality. Now we know a couple of the limitations of objective recruitment, interviews rather, is the candidates going out into the marketplace and posting them on things like Glassdoor because you're asking the same question to all candidates, but on the flipside of that you can do very accurate comparison of two different candidates and get their responses. So for me it's always a bit like when you're doing a scientific experience you put that Glassdoor thing in your limitations box. So what you can do is formulate different questions and measure the same phenomena. So you can reposition the question differently. So you can get a bank of ten questions that you know will measure that skill that you're measuring.\nPL: Example?\nAS: How you have defined teamwork for your organisation is one thing, so what does it look like in, I don't know, British Airways versus Diagio, it can be two very different things, depending on the culture and how they want to work. That's one thing. And then it's about what's a good example and a bad example within that culture and that framework. And then that helps you build your scoring criteria and how you've defined it. Once you've built that and you understood what it looks like for your organisation then you can start building questions off the back of it.\nPL: I wanted to ask you about gut feeling because this is the thing that people always talk about and I'm intrigued by this because in the course of doing these podcasts, you know obviously we've done podcasts about neuroscience, neuroscience practitioners have said to us, \"You need to listen to your gut because your gut is telling you itself so you're not perceiving consciously and it's good data to lean on. And of course then we'll encounter people who are talking about unconscious bias and they'll say, \"Absolutely not! You should not be listening to your gut because it's just telling you all the stuff that you always thought.\" Where do you go with gut?\nKZ: I would suggest that people need to educate their gut a bit more so unconscious bias can't solve the issues of diversity in organisations and more so the unconscious bias awareness and also unconscious bias training doesn't tell you which decision to make, it still won't tell you which candidate to hire or which candidate would be best for the job, that's still the manager's decision. I guess the point of being aware of the different types of people and how this come across is to understand that you might be prone to bias and to take that into account when you make the decision. So perhaps your intuition or your gut is one factor and you may be naturally attracted to a particular candidate or a particular decision in the process but this training is about stopping and asking yourself, 'Why am I thinking that? Why is my gut telling me to do this?'\nPL: Alasdair has a great example of how gut feelings are not to be trusted.\nAS: There was a hire manager that I worked with a number of years ago and we were just sat down and this was when I was doing psychometric feedback and giving recommendations and I thought we'd found an amazing candidate for there, like on paper psychometric profile was hitting all the sweet spots and we'd done a lot of work to identify what those sweet spots were - amazing! Didn't get the job!. And I'm like, that's really, really weird. So I went and had a debrief with the hire manager and I was like, \"What happened? They were great!\" She goes, \"Oh I know yes I know, but there was just something in my gut.\" And she said this, \"Something in my gut I just don't know what it was.\" And I'm like, \"Can you elaborate? We can't just use that as evidence.\"\nPL: Find out!\nAS: And she said, \"Well Alasdair, you know what it was?\" and like, \"Yeah really keen to know,\" she said, \"You know white pumps!\"\nPL: Black mark ((laughs))\nAS: White pumps and I was like, \"What?\" And she said, \"Nobody wears white pumps after August bank holiday weekend!\" And I was like, \"Oh I'm sorry I didn't get the memo on that one.\"\nPL: It's not easy to identify, let alone eradicate our own biases so how to guard against them. Well Alasdair has a simple fix he thinks two heads are better than one.\nAS: Whether you're an SME or a big organisation just have someone there as your conscience and a sounding board afterwards.\nPL: And there's a clear and important role for HR here.\nKZ: We expect HR professionals to act as experts on organisational behaviour and cultures and so without having to make decisions for the organisation in terms of the type of culture it wants to strive to or the types of people it wants to recruit, it's leading those conversations at a very strategic level: what do we expect of our people; how do people fit into our organisation echo system; how do we want us to function; what are our people goals in the next five to seven years; hat are the external trends that are impacting our decisions about people, because even if as an organisation you might take a particular stance on diversity and inclusion societally,\nwe have certain expectations of businesses and how they act and how they include people in their workforces. So that's an interesting tension for HR to hold as well. So it's about having that strategic conversation, asking the question, I wouldn't put it quite so grand as being the conscience of the organisation, but certainly being that educated facilitator of people conversations in the workplace.\nPL: Educated facilitators, neatly put. Thanks to Ksenia Zheltoukhova, Alasdair Scott and Jon Dawson.\nNext month in part two of our diversity series we'll be chewing on a tough question: why does it seem to be so much harder to discuss BAME in the workplace than gender?

      "summary": "What is the connection between productivity and engagement? It’s a key question for organisations and much debated in the HR community. Do engaged employees always work harder, smarter or more efficiently? Does a productive worker always mean an engaged worker? Can you measure the relationship between productivity and engagement?\nIn this episode we look at both sides of the engagement/productivity debate. We explore the evidence that links the two and we discuss the many ways in which engagement (high or low) can impact an organisation. We also offer advice for HR professionals on assessing their own companies’ engagement levels and tips on getting a better understanding of the productivity and engagement relationship.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 0:15:59\nTranscript\nPaula Leach: There is something different about outlook, there is something different about the way in which teams embrace and just get working on something even if they don't know the answer.\nPhilippa Lamb: That was Paula Leach, head of people at the Home Office, pondering one of the great mysteries of our time, the productivity puzzle. Now Paula spent nearly two decades working with Ford in the US where on average workers produce 30% more an hour than we do.\nPaula: So you could describe it as ambition or you could just describe it as just starting.\nPL: Interesting. So perhaps more of a willingness to embrace failure along the way as well.\nPaula: Yeah it could be, there's definitely an optimistic outlook.\nPL: Now of course Paula wouldn't suggest that something as intangible as outlook alone could make us 30% more productive. And another driver that always pops up in any discussion about productivity is engagement. We've all heard that story about the janitor at NASA. President Kennedy asks him what he's doing and he replies, \"I'm helping to put a man on the moon.\" He became a symbol of the engaged worker and, so the theory went, if workers are engaged they will get more done. But what does being engaged actually mean and does that theory even stand up? Paula and her team are now midway through the Brexit process, one of the biggest manpower projects since the second war, so she's no stranger to the challenge of building teams to tackle large tasks. Here are her tips for creating a productive team.\nPaula: An absolute focus on the process and really understanding how you can create the smoothest, leanest, most frictionless process from beginning to end is the first key to productivity.\nPL: And that's worked really well for the automation industry hasn't it, which in some ways, as you say, is a simpler animal than others because you are making a thing, you bring in resources, you turn out a product, more complex for other organisations.\nPaula: It is more complex for other organisations but the trick I think for many organisations is to try and simplify the complexity and if you think about things from an end to end experience you can usually draw some line through that. So there's a process discipline. There's also a discipline I guess it's really around the highest performing teams that you can have and I think that translates itself into a people business a bit more than a component business. And that is that the more we're able to have everybody understanding exactly what they're doing in contribution to common cause and operating at the highest productivity that they can that's sustainable, so I say that because I don't think human beings have the capacity to operate at full 100% all of the time without the ability to recharge and pause, but understanding how we create, not only the mindset but the skills and capability I think it's how that translates into a people system.\nPL: So the factors you've been describing in terms of raising people performance they would all come under the umbrella of engagement, in its broader sense for you?\nPaula: No I don't necessarily think it is just engagement. I think it's a blend.\nPL: And we hear a lot about the role, the supposed connection between engagement and productivity but it's hard to demonstrate it sometimes isn't it?\nPaula: It is, yes it's about how engaged somebody's feeling, it's about their wellbeing such that they have a predisposition to being able to operate at their best performance, it's also about having the clarity of a goal and being able to understand what good looks like. So it's absolutely got to be yes about shared purpose, clarity of goal, clarity of my role in that and what great looks like and me being motivated to do all of those things.\nPL: Which all sounds eminently sensible and yet many organisations have done their homework, put theory into practice, rolled out engagement schemes and seen very little, if any, gain. The hard truth is there is no straight line correlation between engagement and productivity.\nPaula: Well so we're dealing with human beings so to have all of those things completely lined up sounds great on paper, to actually try and achieve that in an organisation is really, really difficult, partly because they're complicated and there's lots of different things that pull us in different directions, even if we have one overall goal there's lots of diversions, but also because people have feelings. That motivation and our productivity is affected by all the things that are happening around us and how we respond to that and then multiply that by however many hundreds, thousands of people you might have in one organisation.\nPL: So good engagement scores don't necessarily tell the story of what's really going on in people's heads?\nPaula: So I love an engagement survey and I think it's really important because it's a moment in time and it's one way of trying to understand what's happening in your organisation and if you don't have those measures it's quite difficult to get anonymised aggregated information about an organisation, how it feels and about how individuals feel.\nPL: There's a but hanging in the air!\nPaula: The but is it isn't the be all and end all. I think using it as a platform, using it as a springboard and ensuring that we give people the ability to follow up with that voice is really, really important.\nPL: So we know the engagement survey is a starting point not a destination but what does it tell us about productivity? Do engaged employees always work harder, smarter or more efficiently? And if it's not being emotionally, cognitively, physically engaged that makes us more productive what does?\nWe asked two experts to help us untangle that puzzle - Dr Ilke Inceoglu is professor of organisational behaviour and human resource management at the University of Exeter Business School. Duncan Brown is Head of Consulting at the Institute for Employment Studies where he leads on HR and reward.\nSo when it comes to productivity how big a part do they think engagement plays?\nDuncan Brown: Yeah that's the 64 million dollar question and it's so hard to answer because it raises really a key question about what's productivity and what's engagement. For the past 20 - 25 years there's been ups and downs but broadly we've grown about 2.5% to 3% and yet since the crash in 2008 we've at best grown at half of that. So a lot of debate about why is productivity not at the levels. And what seems to be emerging is the human factor but what that component is, the extent to which it's employees engagement and beliefs and commitment to high productivity or to what extent it's their skills, or even their pay, some people argue people's pay is too low and that's what we should be doing increasing their pay. So lots of debate.\nPL: So there has been, certainly in recent years, a huge amount of time and resource devoted by the HR community and management generally to this idea of raising engagement in the workforce but that hasn't translated into better productivity has it?\nIlke Inceoglu: When we look at the macro level it's very difficult to show that.\nDB: Yeah and interestingly it hasn't really translate[d] whatever engagement is. If you can measure it in most national measures and corporate measures it hasn't actually translated into higher engagement either.\nPL: It's interesting you say that because we talk to organisations all the time who flourish their engagement scores and say, \"Look how well we're doing,\" but your general sense is across the economy?\nDB: Yeah. If you look at the major providers in these areas generally they're showing flat ratings. They generally show the UK and Europe are low compared to the rest of the world. Employee involvement comes out as a far more significant driver of performance than virtually any other HR practice.\nPL: And what exactly do you mean by that?\nDB: That actually workers are consulted, they're spoken to, they feel their views are inputted and they are taken account of.\nPL: So it's employee voice it's not necessarily autonomy it's voice?\nDB: Yeah and if you take, probably the best summaration [sic] of Engaging for Success, the movement that the RPD's heavily involved in, their first report in 2009 they highlighted four generic factors that they thought would be high engagement and high productivity and voice was the most significant of those.\nII: We also have some new research showing that employees find challenging work can be engaging, so job complexity, job responsibility, but that only makes people engaged if that's also supported by the relevant training so they can actually do the work they are supposed to do well.\nPL: There does seem to be this sense, certainly in areas, the NHS, that even adversity is bonding people together, because it's such a testing environment and that adversity drivers performance in its own way. So it's the flipside almost of everything we might attempt to do in terms of building engagement. It's a negative experience but it is driving engagement. Would that be a fair analysis?\nDB: Definitely and I think in a way, the NHS has done some fabulous work really with although interestingly they call their survey which they use nationally the Staff Survey, they don't call it the Engagement Survey, but they've got really good materials that they use, guidance for managers, how to think about the engagement and the motivation of your staff and how to work on improving it. In a way it's a kind of model example of if you are going to use engagement that's probably the way to do it, tailoring the thing to suit your setting and your staff seems key.\nPL: So has that been a long-standing problem do you think in this whole debate that everyone's been looking for convenient silver bullets?\nDB: Imagine, yeah.\nPL: Can I just pursue this adversity, productivity out of adversity idea because I am interested in it because we've seen examples in the past in very hot-housey environments, aggressive environments in the City, trading floors, no one would say they were pleasant places to work, yet extremely high productivity in some of those instances, obviously very toxic, other environments, the military springs to mind, lots of occasions where people aren't bonded by pleasant experiences, by things that HR and management are doing, they are bonded by the sense of common purpose aren't they, that they're doing something worthwhile in adversity. It's powerful isn't it? A powerful driver.\nII: Very actually and looking at my own research we also find that sometimes people find that something that they find quite challenging and if you ask them do you actually want this responsibility or this level of workload they might say, \"I'm actually not sure,\" but then they are put into that situation and they master it, that can be highly exciting and elevating.\nPL: So has the community been looking at this idea of engagement the wrong way round do you think? Have we been driving on the small, making an environment too embracing and generating complacency perhaps? Do we need more edge, bite, difficulty in our workplaces?\nDB: I think there's certainly an argument that the concept has outlived its usefulness, from my perspective I think looking over the last decade I think it was initially quite helpful to get people aware of the importance of knowing how their staff felt.\nPL: Yeah and actually thinking about their people as more than just parts of the machine.\nDB: Exactly and I think they were very convinced by some of the research and so I think that was very helpful but then as you implied almost then the adoption of common survey tools, we all did the survey and we all competed to get the highest participation rates and the top employer to work for and all that stuff. And also HR picking up almost common templates of best practice when whatever evidence there is, is it's got to be tailored to your own workforce.\nII: So I wouldn't write off the concept yet but I think it's a really good point that it's been overused.\nPL: I'm going to ask you an annoying question given you've given me a great, long, useful list of all the stuff we should be doing, they don't do all that stuff in France and yet they're still 20% better than us on the productivity front, why?\nDB: That's a great question actually which economists keep asking themselves. I mean certainly I think skill seems to be a key area, coming back to the skills agenda, I think the recent OECD analysis of the UK really said we had an unusually high proportion of low skilled jobs and that's of course been a key area of growth in the economy. Skills I think is a key area.\nII: Yeah skills and areas for development. Skill use and opportunities to learn more are linked to engagement. So that could be one. The research hasn't really looked a lot at factors outside work that also influence your engagement levels, work/life balance is one that has been linked to engagement. That's probably where the French, well we know that the average working hours are lower, so that could be another aspect contributing to it.\nPL: Are cultural issues more central to this than we know?\nII: Yeah the drivers of engagement could differ across cultures. I think some people have looked at it. As an example in some cultures, for instance China, cohesion is a lot more important. So that's something that could drive engagement more. I think feeling excited about your work then in countries in Northern Europe or in the UK or Germany.\nPL: That's an interesting point you need to look at your own organisation if we're taking it down to the tiny level to know what needs...\nDB: Or your own countries yeah.\nPL: Your own country, your own sector...\nDB: If you're the Prime Minister up there.\nPL: ...your own organisation to know what needs to be done. Interesting discussion. Thank you both very much. I get a strong sense we'll be talking a lot about this in future.\nSo what can we take from this? Most people agree that a highly engaged workforce is a good thing but companies need to be thoughtful about what their engagement scores are actually measuring. You can be engaged yet unproductive or highly productive in a role you're not actively enjoying. So relying on engagement scores to understand where the energy lies in your organisation may mean you are missing the bigger picture.\nFor more on engagement and productivity head to the CIPD website for a wealth of reports, briefings, blog posts and of course our archive of podcasts all about people and work, the professions longest running podcast series.\nThanks for listening.

      "summary": "There’s not a week that goes by where the spotlight isn't being shone on corporate governance, from the collapse of Carillion to sexual harassment at work and the latest President’s Club scandal. In the wake of the 25-year anniversary of the Cadbury’s Corporate Governance Code, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has launched a new consultation on the code.\nIn this episode we ask what’s gone wrong with corporate governance in the UK? How do we create a better system for the future? And what opportunities do we have now to encourage Board practice to be more progressive and ethical in nature – from a human capital governance model, to a new remuneration committee.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:21:15\nTranscript\nMary Inman: So I think ideally corporate governance should set the tone from the top. In terms of what it's supposed to achieve, being the visionary, I think it's setting the moral tone and the moral compass.\nSaker Nusseibeh: I think the current answer is that corporate governance is about ensuring that the company abides by the law, this is not the right objective, the objective should be about achieving holistic returns which incorporates not just short-term profitability.\nPhilippa Lamb: So the voices you heard there were Mary Inman and Saker Nusseibeh. She's a solicitor at Constantine Cannon, they are an American law firm specialising in whistle-blower cases and Saker is with Hermes Investment, one of our largest institutional asset managers. And with Barclays, Carillion and now Oxfam it's no wonder that everyone is talking about how organisations should be governed.\nMary and Saker both took part in a round table in London recently where a mix of regulators, academics, business leaders and policymakers, they all came together to brainstorm ways to make corporate governance work better.\nYou'll hear a bit more from them in a moment, first though let's meet two experts who've come along to the CIPD's Wimbledon HQ to add their ideas to the mix - Stefan Stern is a long-standing friend of the CIPD podcast, he's director of the High Pay Centre and a former management columnist for the FT; Ed Houghton is senior research adviser Human Capital and Governance here at the CIPD.\nSo before we get into the detail on governance and what actually needs to be done about it shall we kick off with why so many influential people are calling for change?\nStefan Stern: I suppose it's the build-up of scandals, crises, meltdowns, situations where apparently robust, successful businesses are signed off by accountants and investors are told everything's fine and then suddenly they're not fine, suddenly they're in terrible trouble or there's scandal, there's very bad behaviour, which apparently people knew about for many years internally. So something is going wrong at the top of organisations, which is where this thing called governance is supposed to happen. The truth from the shop floor and through the organisation is not getting through to the board or is somehow being denied or shut out of the boardroom and that's a very bit problem and people are rightly worried about it.\nPL: And this isn't fringe organisations is it, this is household names who should know better?\nEd Houghton: Well indeed I mean it's another month, another corporate governance scandal. So these events seem to be fairly frequent and they seem to be large in magnitude and we have a corporate governance regime which is known globally, a leading regime, it's a management system which is incredibly effective and yet we still see organisations failing in these ways and so well I would imagine the debates are going to be now is what is broken and what needs to be changed to improve the system to enable organisations to be productive and effective and also mitigate against these very significant risks to their reputations?\nPL: Now obviously another big issue here is whistle-blowers. We've seen stories cropping up on that this month, we had the scandal last year at Barclays Bank where the CEO illegally tried to unmask a whistle-blower and obviously there is plenty to talk about there - we'll get to it later if we have time. First though let's hear a bit more from Mary and Saker about the Chatham House Conference and in this clip they're talking about what they think is wrong with the way governance works now.\nSN: This idea that companies are there just to generate profits and nothing else is a mistake. The idea that there is a separation between companies and society is a mistake. And the idea that somehow employees are a separate being from citizens, who are a separate being from business is a mistake. If you look at it in the round citizens own the companies that they work in and they own the companies that shape the society that they live in and therefore the discussion should be about what kind of society are we building with ultimately our own capital and our own company.\nSo when you look at things like employment policies for example and the gender diversity question which is now on everybody's mind because of the BBC and others, the question is this, look we own these companies, do we want them to employ us whether we're men or women, whether we're of different colours of skin on whether we have different ethnicities, whether we have different orientations or not? That's the straight[forward] and which is the most efficient? And I think if we concentrate on holistic returns ultimately we find ourselves building sustainable businesses and because we build sustainable businesses they're more resilient and because they're more resilient and more sustainable in the long-term the financial return becomes even better.\nMI: So I think part of the problem with corporate governance right now is that the directors are out of touch. I think part of it is just set up by the fact that they spend only a few days a month or a quarter, depending on what their situation is, that there's a disconnect between what's going on in the C Suite and the Board with what's actually going on down at the organisation.\nPL: So what do you make of that point Mary's just made about this disconnect between the C Suite and the rest of the organisation?\nEH: I think in terms of non-executive directors tending to spend very little time out on the shop floor as it were, understanding the business...\nPL: If any.\nEH: ...understanding the work of prospective...if any, there's a challenge in the induction of non-executive directors onto boards and the time that they spend through the induction process getting to understand the business and I think there's the incentive that needs to be put in place to enable non-executive directors to have that space to go out and understand the organisation and what that means is actually having the flexibility and the opportunity within their role to go and understand the organisation. But then also to use that independence, the independence that they have to be able to think about the organisation from a different perspective. That's the value they should add as a non-executive director. But speaking to some of our senior members we've found that actually their view is that non-executives are not remunerated enough for their role at present, actually non-executive directors don't have the incentive to go out and understand the business because they don't spend enough time and also the amount of money they get to do that is fairly low for the level of skills and expertise that they have. So there's a disconnect I think.\nPL: That's interesting because it's not often you hear about directors being underpaid but in the case of the non-execs you think they are. What do you think of that?\nSS: Yes I mean I think more attention is being paid to this. Derek Higgs, as part of the combined code of governance reforms reported on non-executive directors, very strong on the point about independence, he was the person who suggested this idea that we should have more non-executives or independent directors in the board than executives, which has caused quite a change in boardrooms and I think the principle there was probably quite a good one. But this is a longstanding problem, Tiny Rowland, the industrialist, said that his non-executives were like baubles on a Christmas tree; and Michael Grade, even more colourfully, said that non-executives in business seem a bit like bidets in the bathroom, no-one was exactly sure what they were for but they added a touch of class. And we're still wrestling with this problem what are they really there for and I think Ed's got a good point if we really want a serious contribution from non-executives we're going to have to probably pay them a bit more and ask for more hours and more effort from them.\nPL: But should that be a thing that companies themselves are demanding or should that be a thing that regulation demands.\nEH: Good point I mean I wonder if it's a mix of two. I think being in this space with the corporate governance code refreshed, the Financial Reporting Council is undertaking at the moment there's an opportunity to ask these questions and to think more about actually how we structure some of these concepts around the roles and responsibilities of each of the members of the board. I also think there's a bit of pressure at the moment as well is to shrink the size of boards not grow them and so in terms of getting the right level of expertise in the room you have to be very expert if you're going to have a smaller board to be able to have the impact that you need to have.\nAnd so these pressures are weighing down on the corporate governance system I think which means that there's a challenge to try and evolve it to think about these things in a new way and other than trying to challenge the age-old debate of whether or not the right amount of time is spent by non-executive directors maybe there also needs to be a debate of actually what kind of skills and capabilities do these directors need to have to add value in modern organisations and that is something that I think the Financial Reporting Council will start to pick up more, hopefully in the responses that they get to the corporate governance consultant.\nPL: So some questions for organisations about selection?\nEH: Exactly.\nSS: Yes and this is where we have to use this word diversity don't we because we want different types of people in the boardroom, different types of voices, outlooks, backgrounds, not the Old Boys' Club, not only one sort of social cadre, not people with one limited sort of background, perhaps only finance for example and not a cosy group of chums who all know each other already. Independence should mean this word challenge, it should mean good difficult questions that are hard to answer. There should be an element of abrasiveness without it becoming a fight but a boardroom that just keeps agreeing stuff in a cosy way, in perhaps a rather somnolent way, is going to lead to troubles in the organisation.\nPL: Sure, so the echo chamber idea.\nSS: Exactly.\nPL: Is there also an issue around people having clutches of non-exec directorships?\nSS: Yes I think that's right. I think investors are waking up to this one too, the idea that you could have a huge portfolio of part-time roles and be equally and seriously committed to all of them is really not standing up to scrutiny anymore. Similarly chairing really it seems to me, more than one company seems like a big ask but certainly more than two would be too much for any human being I think.\nPL: Yes and yet not unknown.\nEH: Well indeed and I think there's debate about incentivising non-execs, asking them to take on less responsibilities and actually focus on delivering value in a smaller number of organisations, I think is probably a more effective way of getting the most out of a non-executive director.\nPL: Okay well shall we move on to other thoughts about what needs to happen to improve governance, that's where we seem to have got to right now. Let's hear a bit more from Mary and Saker\nSN: So there is a place for government to change in this, however there's a change which is cultural as well in education. We have to effectively reintroduce the idea that working within the framework of a company brings with it responsibilities as well as privileges and that works all the way from the management down to the lowest worker within the structure because they're all equal. And I think where HR can come into it is to help bring about a culture that highlights responsibility. In my own company, which is a financial company, we pay half our bonuses for people being nice, because nice thoughts encapsulates a lot of behaviours.\nMI: I don't think, and this is ironic since I'm an attorney, I do not think more regulation is the answer. I think there's plenty of regulation, I think what government needs to do is the enforcement arms actually need to enforce. So for instance in the example of the current scandal at Barclays with Jes Staley, their CEO, seeking to unmask a whistle-blower, what the FCA very much needs to do here is to slap him on the wrist. Since the FCA has put into place whistle-blower champion programmes and has said that that is a priority coming out of the financial crisis that we want to have an avenue for people to bring to light problems sooner the FCA has to bring consequences to bear.\nI think HR has a really important role to play in terms of being an avenue, a conduit and a support mechanism to allow the employees' voices to be heard. I think the problem that exists now is that far too many employees see HR and the compliance arms as more compliant and not compliance, meaning they're compliant with the status quo and with the things that are broken. In fact I think HR could be the original employee champion, and that's what they should be but instead I think they're seen as placating the status quo.\nPL: Okay well listening to that, it seems to me there's quite a lot of agreement round the table and with those two actually about where the problems lie so maybe it would be useful at this point to move on to how do we make it happen and obviously there's the role of HR within organisations and then there's external governance. Shall we start with HR because Mary is not impressed is she?\nEH: No I think there's a real role for HR professionals to lead the way when it comes to championing employee voice to boards and ensuring that boards through their decision making consider the workforce and the impact of their decisions on the workforce and if we do believe in this idea of the culture of an organisation generating and creating value and creating the environment through which people can perform and succeed we have to be clear that there is one function in an organisation that will be able to help you understand your culture and that is HR.\nPL: Do you think most boards are ready to hear that from their HR director.\nEH: I don't think they are. I think many boards have a skills deficit when it comes to HR expertise. There's also a challenge when it comes to getting those skills to the board level, so most senior HR professionals getting to that ceiling where they don't then move into an executive director role sitting on the board. And there's also then the space for HR professionals to then move into non-exec roles in other organisations and there are not enough HR professionals wanting to take that step. And in our interviews most recently we've picked up on a really interesting theme that's around the subservience of HR to management and to executive to deliver data, deliver insights, but to not help make decisions.\nPL: It's understandable isn't it they are employees so there is a difficulty there?\nEH: Indeed and we think to lead you have to be able to challenge and be an effective HR person, you have to be able to stand up and make that case and it may mean that you are operating in a way which is challenging your most senior stakeholders in a business. But to be a good professional you have to do that.\nPL: Agreed but that does rest on them being able to hear it? What do you think Stefan?\nSS: Yes we're talking about this thing called culture really which is difficult and hard to pin down as we've heard from some of the contributions. There is law in place, there's the Companies Act 2006, there's this thing called Section 172 which lists the duties of a director, which are very clear in fact and you don't comply or explain with the law you comply with the law and yet of course we don't see any legal action, as Mary was saying, we don't see enough cases being brought.\nCulture is hard to pin down. Too many people from a finance background essentially in the boardroom and numbers are what public companies, in particular quoted companies, are all about, hitting targets, delivering returns to shareholders and unfortunately in this area of culture and people and HR this adjective 'soft' is used in contrast to the so-called 'hard' world of numbers, but actually as we all know, if we're honest about it, even the toughest business leader in the world, the people stuff is actually what really matters, that's where the financial performance comes from in this world of intangible assets and knowledge and ideas and creativity and so we've got to find some other language I think to talk about the human contribution, the contribution of people at work, as opposed to technology and get away from this idea of it being soft because it's not, it's absolutely crucial. It's, as they say, business critical. And that's what HR has got to do and I think perhaps HR has to find some new language, forceful, dynamic language, that brings this home to people.\nPL: And new aspiration from what Ed's saying to actually step up into these non-exec roles.\nEH: And there are very good HR professionals out there who are wanting to take this step and I think more need to be encouraged because reading these corporate governance scandals on a fairly frequent basis now there's a common theme of people and culture coming through and so there's a real space for HR to move into to be able to lead these organisations through this mess that they seem to be getting themselves into again and again.\nPL: What about regulation, do we need more regulation, external regulation?\nSS: Well the code is being revised. It's been a long saga corporate governance reform in this country, it's over 25 years. As a young journalist I went to the launch Adrian Cadbury's first report in 1992, so we've been at this for a very long time. And so it's been done very carefully and thoughtfully. And then as Ed was saying the combined code in this country is copied and borrowed, imitated, around the world and Britain is seen as a leader in governance and yet human nature and bad behaviour still will always override rules. I mean very ambitious people or very clever people and certainly bad people will always find ways around rules. So that's why people and behaviour is what's really crucial in the end.\nPL: But surely also it must be about enforcement because it sounds as though we're not seeing enough enforcement are we?\nSS: No. I mean I do admire, I do like this American concept of the perp walk, you know, the perpetrator, the arrested person, being marched, possibly in handcuffs...\nPL: Dear!\nSS: ...possibly not, in front of the cameras. And I think business people have got to know that ultimately the Companies Act 2006 is the law, it's not optional, it's not voluntary, you've got to obey the law and that's my advice to listeners, do not break the law and certainly do not get caught breaking the law.\nPL: I don't think we want to infer that.\nSS: When people are caught breaking the law there should be sanctions and there should be punishment and people say this out there on the street, no one has gone to gaol because of the financial crisis.\nPL: Well indeed. I mean we're tight for time sadly but I'm going to drag in, because I think it's relevant here, this issue of whistle-blowers because frankly if there isn't enforcement and there's not the will internally then whistle-blowers are another option aren't they? And we are seeing more and more of that come through and indeed Mary's own firm had a big success the week we're recording this actually where a British company was brought to book over their dealing with the States and indeed I believe that the American Regulatory Authorities got on board and involved and what is interesting to me is of course the UK whistle-blower will financially benefit because in the US you get paid for blowing the whistle. Now what do we think should we have that here?\nSS: I think we're heading in that direction, unfortunately. I think we've got to be very careful about that as they are in the States.\nPL: Vexatious claims and all that.\nSS: Exactly they've got to be checked very carefully but it should not really be seen as a pot of gold for blowing the whistle.\nPL: And the downsides are huge aren't they for whistle-blowers?\nSS: Yes and companies are often so bad at dealing with whistle-blowers and yes the Barclays example was a particularly troubling case of let's find out who said this and let's...\nPL: That was astonishing, not once but twice.\nSS: Yeah so no I mean whistle blowing is a last resort but it's got to be an option for people and good companies that think seriously about these things want to get the truth as quickly as possible from wherever it comes, even if it's difficult, even if it's unwelcome truth.\nPL: Well that's the thing isn't it as you say and it will bring about that perp walk that you're saying that we need to incentivise executives to behave properly. Do you agree Ed should we be financially incentivising whistle-blowers?\nEH: I think Stefan hits the nail on the head when it comes to talking about it as a last resort so I think in terms of organisations looking at the employee voice, emphasising employee voice through mechanisms and systems like engagement surveys, like opportunities for employees to meet executive teams to share their insights and ideas I think we have to be able to use those systems first before we get to whistle-blowing. In terms of incentivising it, as is the American system, I think control over that and the appropriate measures need to be in place as well as the right kind of investigation systems and processes to like you say warn against those vexatious claims but I also think there's some merit in it and actually if it does lead to the size of the cases that you do see in the US and individuals do get something off the back of their probably quite hard soul searching they had to go through to take the step to whistle-blow.\nPL: Yes high risk.\nEH: Then it's a very high risk for an individual in a profession, it may be very difficult to come back from and so incentivising may be the right option. We need to see exactly how it would work in the UK system.\nPL: Yeah interesting. Thank you. We are out of time but a fascinating discussion. Thanks very much indeed. Our thanks also to Mary and to Saker for their insights.

      "description": "Episode 133: We explore recruitment fraud, its impact on organisations and what HR can do to protect themselves and others",
      "summary": "In the second part of our cyber security double-bill, we take a closer look at an area of increasing concern: recruitment fraud. Between September 2015 and September 2016 over 1200 instances of recruitment scams were identified as costing victims an estimated £500,000. With individuals losing out, and organisations and the recruitment industry facing increasing reputational damage, we discuss the factors contributing to the rise in these cases.\nIn this episode we hear from experts from SaferJobs, Cifas and CIPD on what to look out for and the steps businesses and HR professionals can take to protect themselves and others against recruitment fraud.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:11:04\nTranscript\nLee D'Arcy: Fraud is on the increase - we know from our numbers. If you talk to the Office of National Statistics and the police they're all saying fraud is a major issue and it's so much easier now for people to commit a crime in their bedroom with their laptop than it is to actually do it physically with all the CCTV cameras that are around. In the old days people would put a stocking over their head, wouldn't they, and go into a shop with a cucumber in a plastic bag. Now they just stay in their bedroom, get their laptop out and pretend to be someone else.\nPhilippa Lamb: Remember Lee D'Arcy from Cifas? We talked to him for our first podcast about cyber risk back in December. Today we're bringing you part two, and while people often do talk about this sort of risk as an IT issue, as you'll hear it's very much about people. 96% of cyber security breaches are down to humans, not tech and it's happening everywhere. Here's another voice from last time, Keith Rosser from Safer Jobs.\nKeith Rosser: Eastern Europe, Asia, all over the world, certainly in parts of Africa too we've found that actually fraudsters can set up with a computer and operate anywhere globally and facilitate fraud in the UK.\nPL: For this episode we're looking specifically at recruitment and the fraud risks facing jobseekers and recruiters. In 2016 there was a sixfold increase in the number of reported recruitment frauds against the previous year. Why such a huge increase? Well that's because recruitment has gone online.\nKR: It is much more tech related. In fact we see much more online applications and online transactions that are fraudulent. It's just so easy now. The internet has enabled so much more opportunities, if you like, to commit crime. The biggest thing that we see is identity theft and identity crime.\nPL: And the latest numbers around this are really shocking, one in ten of all jobseekers said they'd come across this sort of thing and nearly half of them suffered financial loss.\nKR: We get jobseekers who are duped into giving away personal details online because they think they've got a job offer. We get people who get duped into premium rate phone scams for what they think is an interview and of course it isn't.\nWarren Howlett: The folks who are targeting these fraudulent job adverts will be focusing on folks who perhaps have less access to information or knowledge about the recruiting space and they'll be encouraged to apply for a job from a well-known brand and all of a sudden someone who's purporting to be from that organisation is asking them for some money.\nKR: So are told by what they think is a legitimate organisation that you need to pay money for training or a police check prior to starting the job.\nWH: For a visa or asking them to pay for a work permit.\nKR: But of course there is no training or police check and there is no job. We had a lady recently who was about to leave Italy to move to the UK for her dream job literally had organised her full relocation, found out the day before the move that it was a scam, lost the money, had already given up her home in Italy and had to...\nPL: You get the picture, these scams have really disastrous consequences for jobseekers and of course they're damaging for recruiters too. The voices you heard there were Keith Rosser, from earlier on, and the CIPD's head of HR content, Warren Howlett. Keith chairs Safer Jobs, it's a non-profit created by the Metropolitan Police to raise awareness and combat crime in the job seeking and recruitment arena. So as we've heard there are recruitment scams around entirely fake jobs, but there are also criminals who create real jobs with the sole intention of stealing money.\nKR: We get lots of boiler rooms, and boiler rooms are criminal networks where they set up, I guess, cold-calling sales operations and they trick people into working in them and when the people start and they think they're going into a sales role they find that perhaps the accommodation or the costs they're incurring are greater than the salary and to pay for it they have to hit targets and then they find themselves stuck. Generally [what] boiler rooms do is they target vulnerable people to release savings for investments that aren't real and we saw just this year two very large, well known, job boards had boiler room organised gangs on them that duped over 4,000 people into applying for boiler rooms in the UK and abroad.\nPL: I think this is a fascinating subject because when I started researching it for the purpose of this podcast I have to admit I knew very little about it. I'd heard very little about this sort of recruitment fraud until this year. Has it really ramped up or have I just been behind the curve?\nKR: It really has ramped up. So it's very big in the United States and what we've seen is a move away from the United States into other parts of the world and particularly into the UK market. So in the last two years we've seen a 300% rise in reports, people being affected by a fake job and technology as a great enabler is also a great facilitator for these kind of operations so there's more people looking for work online but also the fraudsters are becoming so much more clever about what they're doing. So it used to be a year or two ago that a jobseeker would have to apply to an advert and they would get then hooked in but actually what happens now is the fraudsters are actually targeting jobseekers and moulding the fake job to the jobseeker and contacting them on things like social networking sites and saying, \"I see you're a HR manager and actually we're looking for a HR director, you fit the bill, you look just the right person,\" and they persuade the person into the scam and actually directly target them and actually that's a new method we've seen over the last six months.\nPL: And that's for the purposes of identity theft?\nKR: It could be identity theft. We had a gentleman recently who had a genuine job, resigned from his genuine job thinking he'd got a new job, gave his personal details to the employer, found out there was no job and is now unemployed, then found out that a car had been bought on finance under his name, two companies had been set up under his name.\nPL: And it's really horrifying isn't it? And I've seen figures suggesting that one in ten jobseekers have been affected by that. It's a huge number, and nearly half of them apparently had financial loss.\nKR: Yeah. And I think where this is so sad is that so often these scams are targeting the most vulnerable people. So they're targeting people that may have been out of work for six months. We had a case recently of a person who had not been in work for about three to six months, living in London, had a family, two small children so struggling to make ends meet, finally got offered the job they thought was their way out of this. However the job required them to pay for up front training and up front checks, so the person borrowed money from family members to be able to pay to be able to start his job. Of course, then found out there was no job. So not only was still unemployed but had borrowed money from family members just to start the job. So you can imagine the sort of situation that leaves people in.\nPL: These are terrible stories and if you're thinking that none of this could really affect you or your organisation well listen to this from Warren.\nWH: The number of organisations that have been negatively affected is also staggering. So you've got big household names, and they're the typical targets of fraudsters because they're looking to use a name that will attract the attention of a candidate. They go to the full extent of having email addresses that will look like the organisation, they'll have folks that are calling purporting to be from the organisation, actually undertaking an interview with the candidate. So all the way through to the candidate actually receiving paperwork and thinking that they've got the job until they turn up for day one and it doesn't exist.\nKR: We have a range of sectors, a range of sectors and a range of well-run organisations who even have people turning up on a Monday morning thinking they're starting their new job and the organisation has to turn them around and say there is no work and there's a real brand reputational problem there for organisations.\nPL: And these are sophisticated scams aren't they complete with very convincing websites? It's not the sort of thing that even a well-informed person would immediately spot.\nKR: They're cloning websites, they're using company email addresses with perhaps one slight variation in the formula so it's really hard to spot. The emails look and feel right. We've seen job application or job offer letters genuinely branded by the organisation. We've seen many cases where, and this is really important for your audience, the HR manager or director who is on the email or in the job offer letter is actually the genuine HR manager.\nPL: So even if you check it looks legitimate.\nKR: It's the fraudster's found out who the HR manager is at XYZ company and has used their actual details.\nPL: And I've seen a number of organisations have now got chunks on their website explicitly aimed at people who might be considering going for a job there talking about how they recruit and warning people about scams. I know I've seen one from Total, they're by no means the only one are they?\nKR: Yeah that's right, hotels, oil and gas, retail, they seem to really suffer from this.\nPL: So how can you guard against recruitment fraud/ as a job hunter you can start by educating yourself about the most common scams. Obviously look for iffy spelling or grammar in any documents or emails from addresses not linked to the company they're purportedly hiring for. And always tell long distance, potential employers you'll make your own travel and accommodation arrangements if they try to charge you. And for employers? Well there's the Safer Jobs initiative where Keith Rosser is chair.\nKR: But also we work with recruitment companies and job board so that a HR department, to ensure their supply chain is compliant, can work with recruiters and job boards that are partners of Safer Jobs. So we're looking at that total transparency across the supply chain and making sure that ultimately every jobseeker knows there's somewhere they can go to get free help and advice.\nPL: This sounds great. How do people get on board with this?\nKR: It's really easy. For a HR professional in an organisation literally just have to contact us online via the website. All they have to commit to doing is putting our logo and text on their site so it's a message to jobseekers. We'll add them to our site as 'these people are safe employers', and what we will do in return for those organisations is any jobs online under their name which aren't legitimate they can report to us and we'll get them taken down. If I were to tell you that in 2015 we would have had about 700 people come to our website a month, currently we easily see 50,000 a month. So you can see how much it's grown in that time.\nPL: Food for thought. Thanks for listening.

      "summary": "The past twelve months have seen enormous changes in the social, political and economic landscapes: new policies and changing market conditions; new ways of working and changing employer/employee relationships; and changing values and demands for accountability and ethical practice.\nWith businesses changing seemingly faster than ever before, the role of HR and L&D professionals has never been more important.\nIn this episode we explore what top HR, L&D and business experts see as the biggest challenges and opportunities facing organisations and people professionals in 2018. We look at leadership, collaboration, technology and organisational agility and how HR and L&D roles in each of these areas contributes to making businesses more productive and ultimately more successful.",
      "full_text": "Duration: 00:24:12\nTranscript\nPhilippa Lamb: Doesn't that sound of an orchestra warming up get your heart racing, all that anticipation about what's to come? That was the wonderful conductor Gernot Schultz with Manchester's Piccadilly Orchestra at this year's ACE and we'll be hearing more from him in a bit. First though what's on the agenda for you as we barrel headlong into a brand new year? Well here are a few thoughts from a very unscientific straw poll when we asked conference delegates what they reckoned their senior leaders might be thinking about at the start of the New Year.\nThink about your board of directors in their board room what is the biggest thing they're going to be talking about?\nFV: What did they do on the New Year's Eve ((laughs))\nMV: Revenue.\nMV1: GDPR\nFV1: CIPD\nPL: Why is that?\nFV1: Start of the year instead of having a diet think about CIPD.\nMV2: Bringing in more revenue ((laughs))\nFV2: Q1 orders for us, Q1 revenue, money and what it's going to cost them.\nFV3: Values and behaviours, so what is it that we're actually looking for? How do we want people to turn up in the workplace?\nFV4: It will be culture, culture, absolutely culture.\nFV5: I think the change to data protection laws.\nFV6: Retaining staff is a big one for us, making sure that we get good people and that we keep good people.\nPL: Some of those may well chime with you too and today we're going to explore what we think HR is going to be talking about this year. You won't be surprised to hear that AI tops the list or that productivity is on there too and we've chosen two others which we're suggesting will be even more important this year than last and that's agility and leadership.\nNow talk about tech ramped up last year as stories about AI and machine learning became regulars in the news. Clare Dillon left Microsoft Ireland's leadership team a couple of months ago to start her own consultancy. Now she helps organisations make the most of emerging tech so she knows more about all this than most of us. For her it's the sheer range of technologies that makes right now such a fascinating moment and she thinks the opportunities for HR are really exciting.\nClare Dillon: Most remarkable about where we are right now in terms of the evolution of technology is that it's not just one area that is evolving very quickly, it's that there is actually innovation happening in multiple sets of areas: nanotechnology, bioengineering, robotics, AI, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud storage and computing power, you're looking at wearable devices, you're looking at sensors. They're all beginning to advance together.\nPL: This isn't niche anymore.\nCD: No.\nPL: All the mainstream news programmes are talking about it all the time, largely in the context obviously of job loss\nCD: That's right.\nPL: But do you subscribe to the way of thinking that it's more about bits of jobs than jobs?\nCD: I do. What I find more interesting are the services that are actually enhancing our ability to do our job.\nPL: Such as?\nCD: Tecs.oi which is a service that analyses the job descriptions on a website and tells you whether the language is inclusive or not. So it's kind of like a spellchecker hyped up to be an inclusivity checker. And they've had really good results by helping us be better humans which I think is really interesting as an artificial intelligence agent.\nPL: Do you think that most organisations will actually end up using these technologies just to cut the cost of what they already do or do you think they will really grab the opportunity to do what they do better?\nCD: So I think they should and certainly there are reports out there to suggest that the folks that actually are going to get the most out of artificial intelligence are not just looking at it from a cost-cutting perspective because people have to become more competitive all the time, they have to look at new opportunities for growth. And the most successful businesses are not just transforming from a digital perspective but they're transforming their business models. So if you're only looking at cutting costs you're by definition going to lose because there's going to be someone coming bigger, faster, better behind you doing something more innovative.\nPL: I mean as you say these technologies are getting increasingly good at doing tasks like analysing medical scans or writing news articles - all those sort of things that we wouldn't have even thought of five years ago. Do you see a time when AI will become genuinely creative?\nCD: I've seen some research reports to say they can never replicate the creative process that humans have, however in saying that I have seen computer-generated art. I have heard computer-generated music.\nPL: And novels?\nCD: And novels. I mean humans often can't tell the difference. If you can't tell the difference between the output then maybe it doesn't matter how we got there.\nPL: I mean these are interesting philosophical questions. I mean what is art becomes a whole broader question now.\nCD: Exactly.\nPL: Where does the human fit if tech and AI can do all that?\nCD: I think about some of the functions that for example HR do and I think about the fact that they're not able to get to enough people to do them like in certain large organisations perhaps coaches are only available to the top 2% or the top 10%. And I think about the value that would be inserted into the organisation if everyone had access to that. And then I think well actually that's where the real value is it's not about replacing the folks that are there doing it because some people will still love that face to face interaction but it's about dramatically increasing the ability to deliver those services.\nPL: So it's scale?\nCD: At a scale and then you think about the planning for that and the fact that you're dealing with so many more people at that much richer level and then they're the kind of considerations that HR will have to start looking at: where are people who do need coaches? What do they need coaching in? That is a whole new set of work. So it's a different set of tasks, it won't be the same things anymore.\nPL: For learning and development professionals this sort of AI will begin to define not just how but what we learn. Here's corporate learning expert Nigel Paine.\nNigel Paine: Building up profiles of individuals and allowing learning to become personalised essentially.\nPL: Okay so what might that mean on the ground?\nNP: What it means is that if you've got some kind of online platform as you use it, it knows your role, it knows where you're struggling a bit, it knows where you're focusing; it knows where you're going very fast through stuff or slow through stuff. So it begins to build a profile of you in the background and therefore it starts suggesting rather than you having to search. An entirely personalised learning operation which is different for every single person.\nPL: So it's self-directed but it's personalised?\nNP: Yes it's personalised and therefore increasing individual productivity, because it's almost anticipating where you're going to go wrong rather than reacting when you have gone wrong and that will definitely increase productivity by possibly several percentage points in an organisation.\nPL: Interesting in these times of low-level productivity and another tech idea has caught Nigel's eye too.\nNP: Imagine Netflix for learning, so a very attractive, easy to use, very accessible platform that keeps flashing stuff in front of you and says, \"So here's a little synopsis I think you'd love this. This is 95% likely to meet your needs. This is something that the organisation is focusing on I think you've got a little gap here!\" very colourful, graphics-led, not a boring list of things and every time you click on that platform you're building up their knowledge about you. So on the one hand you can say it's scary, on the other hand you can say, \"This is going to save huge amounts of time and effort.\" And I think that will become learning that is literally part of your work.\nPL: And where is the level of excellence with that level of learning at the moment because you talk about the idea of the learning chasing you around, it's like ads chasing you around the internet isn't it and we all know how annoying that can be when the algorithm hasn't quite got it right?\nNP: Yes.\nPL: So where are we at with it?\nNP: Well we're pretty close I think. If you look at some of the experience platforms they allow you to plug in so much other resources so that's information coming from different sources. So they kind of generate themselves almost.\nPL: It's highly refined?\nNP: Yeah highly refined.\nPL: Because the argument always goes that we exist in an echo chamber if we do that because it only shows us stuff that it kind of knows that we're interested in and you don't have that diving down a rabbit hole experience which admittedly can be time-wasting or venturing into territory that you might not be expecting to venture into.\nNP: You are right and I think there are two responses to that. The first response is that it's not just you it's the organisation plus you. So it's not just learning about you it's learning what the organisation needs. And the second point is that the output of this has to be more curious, more confident, more competent learners. And once you've got that people move off on their own.\nPL: Organisational agility is on everyone's agenda for this year, not least the police. Currently tackling the many challenges of merging two very different police forces, Devon and Cornwall and Dorset, Graham Smith can talk about all this from experience. He's director of people and leadership for the combined force and to give you an idea of the scale of the job that's 7,500 people spread across 5,000 square miles. And if you're picturing people management inside the police force as a bit old school well think again.\nGraham Smith: Having come into it 17 years ago now it hasn't been quite what I was expecting.\nPL: In what way?\nGS: Policing has very much got a can do attitude and you expect it to be very regimented, very hierarchical, actually some of the most open and left of centre thinkers are some of your senior police officers.\nPL: Have we all been led astray by too much TV drama do you think?\nGS: Yeah maybe there's an element of that.\nPL: And less siloed and more creative than people might think you're saying?\nGS: Very much so. I think people would be stunned by some of the levels of creativity and some of the things that are tried.\nPL: Fascinating, I need more examples now you've said that.\nGS: I was talking to somebody about the workforce planning process that we use and how we look at demand and how we've got to constantly shape around that demand and then deal with the supply side of it and they were shocked from a private sector perspective as to actually just how creative we have been in terms of looking at the process but how lean and how fast it was. So the fact that we are taking in data, we're capturing huge amounts of information about crime and we're looking at demands on the organisation and we're looking at threat, risk and harm and we're assessing where we can put those resources in the most effective way possible.\nPL: And that's now, it's not in the future, it's constant, right now!\nGS: And that's now and then we'll go back through that cycle and we'll go and repeat it with the next set of data because it never stands still. And some of the issues around call handling I think there are areas within the private sector that would just be stunned by the amount of work that is done to ensure that we can get to calls as quickly as possible and to triage that in the most effective way.\nPL: From what you're saying it sounds like there's a lot of public misconception about how the police forces operate across the country and maybe some lessons from the police force for the private sector.\nGS: Yeah we do these things called 'organisational raids' where we'll set a team up and we will go into an organisation, so in Dorset companies like John Lewis, J.P. Morgan, and we'll put a team in and we'll say, \"Right teach us what you do, what's important for you, how do you make a difference?\" and then we'll grab those lessons and we'll bring them back into the organisation.\nPL: So you take operational lessons from retailers and the rest, from investment banking, and bring it back in and see what you can learn from it?\nGS: Yeah. And certainly at the moment there is a huge push in policing around academic rigour, levels of creativity and looking at things differently but putting the academic rigour behind that. So in Devon and Cornwall at the moment we have a programme on wellbeing that we're linked in with Exeter University, we've brought in doctorate students from Exeter to work through the research findings and we're looking at things like the impact of shift patterns on sleep quality.\nPL: And when you've crunched that data and you've got some outcomes from it from what you're saying you can turn that into practice quite fast?\nGS: We can turn it into practice quite fast and because of the level of cooperation between the police forces we'll share that across the country.\nPL: Sounds like agility to me. Paula Leach has one of the most interesting and testing jobs in the UK right now, she's chief people officer at the Home Office. With Brexit looking Whitehall has already created and filled 3,000 new posts. Brexit Secretary, David Davis, tells us there could be 5,000 more by this time next year. For Paula all this is more a resource challenge than a policy one and of course Brexit is only part of what the Home Office does every day. So whichever way you look at it it's a big job and right now it's all about agility and productivity.\nPaula Leach: It is and there's multiple ways in which we can approach that. We're used to working at scale so those numbers, although they sound very big, we're working in a system which is very big and delivering across the whole country, so proportionally it's challenging but it's not something that we're not used to doing. The open challenge for us is when do you make the choice about committing to those resources given that we're not entirely sure exactly how we will need to deploy? And secondly what range of options do you look at? So this isn't just about hiring more people, it might be about how do you create capacity within an organisation. So that can mean a number of things, including choices that we make about prioritising work, it might be about where we base work, it might be about how we balance skills in the organisation. So all of that is part of this, it's not just about incremental resource in an organisation.\nPL: And obviously at the start of that challenge it's finding them isn't it? And when talk about these 8,000 new people you don't just whistle them up from nowhere do you?\nPLE: Actually whenever you have a big change in an organisation's demand, so for example in our case Brexit could be an example of changing demand for the Civil Service resources, you have to look at that in concert with the opportunity and the opportunity is for us to go faster perhaps with some of our technological transformation and then that directly leads into skills. So that's about what's the skills mix for the future? We've already got many of these plans in place, the opportunity is whether or not we accelerate some of that and how we manage to redeploy resources that we already have, reskill them and then reach into a marketplace within the country that, to be honest, is quite saturated and quite in demand, which is the technological and digital marketplace.\nPL: As you say thinking across public sector, not just Whitehall, everyone's in a cost-cutting environment, money is tight, there's all the issues around tight budgetary constraint leading to tight investment in people, let alone tech, this sense of the returns from doing more of the same are drying up now, so is it a year when you and everyone across the organisation in its broadest sense will need to be thinking in really innovative ways because you can't just repeat what's happened even in the last post-recession years?\nPLE: Yeah I mean I can't think of any organisation that doesn't constantly need to be thinking both about continual improvement and about transformative change within an organisation.\nPL: And I suppose with Brexit I mean expectations have never been higher and it's a hard deadline isn't it, so it's not just a general aspiration to do better or be more innovative it's a 'deliver this by this deadline' situation?\nPLE: It is and it provides an impetus to us as an organisation. We're a high performing organisation, we're absolutely committed. We can't not deliver in this space and we want to do so efficiently. So that requires us to be thinking well ahead as much as we can and planning for those scenarios and that's exactly what we're doing. And those scenarios range and that makes it quite complicated because we could be talking about redeployment of resources and some extra resources, all the way through to quite significant change. But having said all of that we are doing the scenario planning, we're looking at the ways in which we can start to change now, not waiting until such time as clarity become available.\nPL: I mean I've sat here and asked you a string of questions about Brexit, I really wonder are you fed up with talking about Brexit? Is it the only conversation?\nPLE: It's not the only conversation. I think if you think back across however many years there's a version of some major change that has to be absorbed in the public sector at any given time.\nPL: But this is a big one.\nPLE: This is a big one but having said that we are where we are and looking backwards and thinking about how difficult it is isn't really very helpful, so I think from our perspective this has got to be about providing confidence in the people that use our services, providing confidence within our own employees and teams that we can meet some of those challenges.\nPL: Now back to that lovely moment at last year's annual conference when the CIPD's CEO, Peter Cheese, introduced conductor Gernot Schultz. Gernot is a long-time member of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, a musician and an educator and for Peter the parallels with his work for leaders was obvious.\nPeter Cheese: Any of you who know classical music will appreciate what conductors do. Those who don't probably think it's just a bloke waving a stick and all the hard work's done by these guys. He will demonstrate there's a lot more to it than that. You also need to understand that Gernot only met this orchestra, when did he meet you, yesterday, yesterday evening something like that?\nFV: About two hours ago.\nPeter Cheese: Or about two hours ago. So a leader coming into an organisation, a group of people and helping to lead and to orchestrate. So I think you'll find lots of parallels between the world of orchestral music and how the dynamics of orchestras work, all the subtle undertones that go on and all the divas that sit around us and all their talents and bringing them all together harmoniously. So Gernot please come up and join your orchestra.\n((Music Plays))\nGernot Schulz: The role of a conductor yeah from outside we seem to be the dictators, waving with the baton and then the members of staff do the things we want them to do, but that's not the way it really works, not at all, not at all.\nPL: I suppose if I was to make a comparison with the sort of work most people do, office-bound work, you come in as a leader of a group of experts who don't even necessarily know each other very well. You don't know them, you may know them, you may have worked with them before, you may not, and you have a very limited timeframe in order to produce a really high quality piece of work and as you say they're experts, they know they're experts so you can lead but you can't necessarily command, how do you convey all that in a very short rehearsal time?\nGS: At the very end it's a matter as, to my opinion every kind of leadership is, it's a matter of your personality, of your ability to be authentic.\nPL: So what links you with these musicians is the music, you have no other immediate connection with them I guess, that's your shared purpose, do you need to know them to get the best from them or do they need to know you?\nGS: At first I perceive their habits, how they are used to play this or that piece, that's obvious within the first five minutes. And then there is my way to see the music and now it's about this gap. So it's a hard work of integration and of coming together, my vision, which normally I don't change, at least I don't change very much, I have to stay to my conviction and to convey that in a very convincing way. Yes as I said I cannot command them, I cannot force anybody to do that, I have really to convince them.\nPL: And how do you do that?\nGS: My lifelong work to be very deep into the scores, into the music, into the composer's life so that there is obvious for everybody it's about a higher purpose. It's not about me.\nPL: Your favourite piece to conduct and why?\nGS: That's an often asked question.\nPL: A particular favourite if you were relaxing at home what would you listen to?\nGS: No music there.\nPL: That can't be true.\nGS: I have music around me all the time.\nPL: And funnily enough Nigel Paine has a bit of a thing about silence too.\nNP: We know more and more about how the brain learns and one of the clear reference points that's emerging is that we don't reflect enough and in this world where everything is full on all the time the only time we are quiet is when we sleep and that's quite useful to have a good night's sleep but I think there's a huge value in just taking even a minute or two minutes just in silence, sometimes with your eyes closed and just think about what you're learning, what is important to you and what you should focus on. And funnily enough when you do that that is what you focus on and the learning is deeper. So I'm a great believer in silence, I think we should have more silence in L&D.\nPL: And for all those people raising their eyebrows listening to this and thinking, 'Mm,' it's embedded in neuroscience isn't it?\nNP: It is, it is absolutely true. Yes we weren't meant to chatter our whole life.\nPL: That's a nice message to take forward for the year isn't it, say less!\nNP: Say less, be silent, 2018 welcome.\nCIPD Trust\nTackling barriers to work today whilst creating inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.\nBullying and harassment\nDiscover our practice guidance and recommendations to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace.\nLinkedin\nFacebook\nYouTube",

CIPD and CEB worked together on a series of podcasts to reveal insights from both organisations around this topic. Three of the podcasts are now available.",
      "full_text": "Episode 1\nDuration: 00:20:39\nTranscript\nVoiceover: Welcome to the first in a series of five podcasts from CIPD and CEB on the importance of growth-based careers. The series will focus on CEB's research on the future of career pathing called The New Path Forward - Creating Compelling Careers for Employees and Organisations.\nIn this first episode we'll be talking about why we urgently need to rethink our approach to career management. And in the subsequent episodes, we'll talk about the four specific shifts we need to make in how we approach careers, from designing experience-based careers and motivating employees, to communicating with the internal labour-market and how to get managers to stop hoarding talent. We'll delve into some interesting case studies from National Grid, LinkedIn and HCL and discuss the steps organisations can take to improve their career management strategies.\nFirst up, here's Claire McCartney, Advisor for Resourcing and Talent Planning at CIPD and lead author on the Employee Outlook series, talking about how organisations are changing and what that means for career management.\nClaire McCartney: Now the world of work is changing rapidly and often our organisational approaches to career management have not kept a pace with that change. Increasingly organisations are flatter in structure and many have adopted matrix ways of working. Many middle management layers have also been taken out of organisations during the recession, making historical career paths blurred and much less obvious.\nWe're also seeing the emergence of the concept of career FOMO, something that was written about in the Times recently, and for those of you that haven't come across the term, it's the fear of missing out when it comes to our careers and career progression. This is something that is increasingly being talked about and particularly by the younger generation, who are often frustrated by the lack of career progression opportunities they have experienced to date. This is further heightened when they compare themselves to their parents' generation and where they were at at their age in relation to things like career progression, income and house ownership. Career FOMO is also being fuelled by social media, which often projects an image of everyone else having more successful careers and glamorous lifestyles, but this often isn't the truth in reality.\nSo we therefore need to challenge our outdated notions of traditional and hierarchical career progression, both CIPD and CEB research indicates that today's careers are just not working. The CIPD's latest employee outlook research shows that around a third of employees feel it is unlikely that they will be able to fulfil their career aspirations in their current organisation and this rises to over half of 18-24 year olds.\nCurrently almost a quarter of employees are looking for a new job and this represents the highest number that it's been in over two years. And if organisations don't want to see their talented employees walk out the door they need to focus more proactively on collaborative job design and providing growth opportunities.\nWhen asked about productivity in the workplace, a hot topic in the UK currently because we are lagging behind our European competitors, employees themselves maintain that they would be more productive if there were more scope to use their own initiative in their roles, if they were given interesting work and if they were given work that compliments their skills. And with a third of employees currently saying they are over qualified for their roles and more likely to feel disengaged at work, this is a real issue.\nWe are also seeing an increase in proportion of those that are currently looking for a new job indicating they would like to do a different type of work all together, now this may be a reflection of their increasing frustration with their current career paths or just a greater desire for a diversity of experiences. Either way it's important that organisations are aware of employees future plans and that line managers are having regular career conversations with them, because they may be able to facilitate moves internally to different departments to satisfy the need for such experiences.\nThe CIPD's recent employee outlook focus on skills and careers delves further into employee's disappointment with their career progression, it finds that poor careers advice is stopping employees from getting into the right jobs in the first place, and bad line management preventing them from getting on once at work, as well as other things such as lack of effective training and negative office politics.\nThe research also finds that a high proportion of people from poor backgrounds are held back when it comes to careers because they cannot afford to invest in their own personal development by studying for a qualification or indeed developing new skills. So the research highlights the importance of line management development and lifelong learning opportunities of people of all ages.\nAll of these factors point to the need to redefine our approaches to careers. In the light of this new context we need to work in partnership with employees on their careers and aligning organisational and individual needs. We need to think about career growth in the round rather than traditional hierarchical progression, and giving employees opportunities for a breadth of diverse experiences that help to maximise their employability going forward. Ultimately we need to apply the principles of growth based careers but in a way that works in our own context and settings.\nNow I am very excited that we have this opportunity to hear some of the latest research findings into growth-based careers and innovative organisational approaches which can help shape our thinking and potentially some of our approaches to career management going forward.\nVoiceover: Here's Nicola Josephs, Senior Executive Advisor at CEB discussing their research findings and looking at how today's careers are falling short of employee and employer expectations, and what steps organisations can take to rethink their approach to career management.\nNicola Josephs: At CEB what we've found in our research over the past decade is that the shape of careers has been evolving rapidly and radically and our approach to career management has not kept pace. And at the same time the complexity and diversity of careers has been increasing we've been devolving more responsibility for careers and career ownership to our employees directly. And perhaps, not surprisingly employees aren't happy with the results and neither are we as organisations. There seems to be a growing misalignment between what employees want and what the organisation needs and can deliver on.\nSo what we wanted to understand with this research initiative is how to get our approach to careers back on track, how to get organisations and employees better aligned and how to build a career culture that grows employee career satisfaction and organisational capabilities. And here's the good news, we know the right path forward.\nSo let me start with the reason that we're having this conversation, which is that today's careers are failing both employers and employees, organisations are concerned that we are going to be faced with capability gaps in the not so distant future. Three quarters of heads of HR say that in the next 3-5 years they will have a shortage of key skills in their organisation. And that's not just theoretically concerning, that means that we are looking at a future where we don't have the internal capabilities we need to execute against our business strategy. And at the same time the overwhelming majority of employees, 70%, are currently dissatisfied with future careers at the organisation and that dissatisfaction is driving departures.\nToday a lack of future career opportunities is the number one reason employee's cite for leaving their organisation and that tops even compensation and manager quality as a driver for dissatisfaction, which suggests employees don't actually leave because of their managers, they leave because of their careers.\nSo what is it exactly about their careers that is driving this level of dissatisfaction? Well we're increasingly not able to meet their desires to continue to move up. Over the past 4 years we've seen a steady upward trend when it comes to tenure at all levels. In fact an overall increase in tenure of 30% over the last 4 years, an increase in tenure in role means decreasing upward progression. So this is one of those places where a rising trend line is not necessarily good news, especially for the majority of our employees who continue to see future career opportunities as synonymous with upward advancement. The simple reality of course is that largely upward linear careers are unlikely to return.\nNow most organisations have been stripping out management layers for the past decade for multiple reasons; cost reduction, restructuring, new organisation structures and more. And three quarters of heads of HR don't see us adding back in any additional layers over the next five years and there are no indications that organisational structures will ever look like they did a decades ago. So this is the reality that most of us are in, and that most of us can anticipate staying in: flatter organisations with longer time frames associated with upward movement. The shape of the organisation has changed, and that's a big part of why the shape of careers has changed and has had to change. But the new shape of careers and the way we have been managing against it is leaving employees unprepared and organisations at risk.\nThere are two big drivers behind the new shape of careers that's driving career derailment, longer runs and steeper rises. Now let me talk about what each of these mean and why that's creating a risky environment to both organisations and employees.\nSo longer runs, is about longer time in role. Employees are staying in role 30% longer today and they're simply not getting the broad range of development opportunities they need to perform effectively in more senior roles. Also, because employees sometimes get desperate to move, even laterally, they do not always choose wisely and we find too many end up making a bad lateral move or even leaving the organisation because of these longer runs.\nAnd when employees do finally have the opportunity to move up, they experience steeper rises because the rungs on the ladder are getting further and further apart in our flattened organisations and so when vertical career moves do happen, employees are often taking a significantly broader jump in responsibilities. And today nearly half of promoted employees, 46%, face what we would call a traumatic transition. With flatter organisation structures and narrower development, they are simply unprepared for the next big career move and end up underperforming during and up to 18 months after their transition.\nAnd that is the result of what happens when you combine a new organisation environment that's flatter, more matrixed, more diverse, more efficient, with a career culture that has employees more focussed on getting promotions than growing capabilities. And that's why we need to realign our career culture to focus on career growth not just career trajectory.\nThe thing is though, we already get that we're just not getting there.\nWhen we asked our members in our survey what elements of a career culture they want over 90% said that ideally they need the organisations career culture to be focused on growth, however when we asked what kind of career culture currently exists nearly three quarters say that it is still primarily focussed on promotions. Meaning that less than one third of organisations that want a growth based career culture have been able to achieve it. But we know that's got to be the right destination that we need employees to think of their careers in terms of growth instead of narrowly focussing on just how to get that next promotion.\nSo let's discuss how a growth based career culture looks different to a promotion based one.\nA promotion based career culture is all about the up, movement is largely vertical driven by vacancies and there is little cross functional or cross silo movement. A growth based career culture is all about the build. Employees are building and growing their capabilities through planned-for moves that are lateral and vertical and movement happens across silos and functions depending on growth opportunities and business needs. And based on the reality of the new shape of the organisation and shifting needs of the business we need to shift our career culture from promotion-based to growth-based and what we found is that most organisations today are trying to drive a more growth focussed career culture by focussing on employee ownership of careers.\nToday 90% of heads of HR and 76% of employees agree that the responsibility for careers and career pathing falls primarily on the employee, and there are clearly benefits to employee career ownership. Careers are too complex and diverse for the organisation to own anymore, careers can be better customised through employee ownership, employees are more vested and motivated through ownership and they feel more autonomous and empowered than in a culture where ownership resides with the organisation.\nAnd in order to build more employee ownership of careers we've been engaging in a number of strategies. We've been publishing and sharing examples of different career paths other employees have taken to advance their careers, we've been building out our job boards so that employees have visibility into all the opportunities that are open in the organisation and can search for jobs that are of interest to them and we offer training and publish guides all intended to help employees find their career aspirations and plan their path. And it all sounds right and reasonable on the surface. But let's take a step back for a moment and think about what's happening.\nThe organisation looks very different than it used to, even a decade ago, its flatter, more diverse, more globally dispersed probably more matrixed. The business environment also looks very different, it's a much more dynamic business environment than decades ago, and as we have been talking about, the career environment is changing. The shape of careers is evolving, it's incredibly complex, diverse, and ambiguous. And so we've put employees in charge of their own careers and then we wonder why we're not moving towards a more of a growth based career culture. And that led us to consider four key questions then, about how we look at career management moving forward.\nFirst if we're concerned that we will have skills shortages in the future and we don't think our current career framework is setting employees up to develop the right capabilities, then the first key question is - how should we design careers for capability growth? Second question is how do we motivate our employees to buy into growth based careers? Third, how do we market the right opportunities to the right employees at the right time? And then forth, how do we get managers to better support career growth by sharing talent? And the answers to these questions shape the new path forward and they show why we need to shift away from employee ownership of careers to a new career partnership.\nSo let me overview what specifically those shifts look like. With our current approach to promoting employee ownership careers we design careers around positions, motivate employees through title progression, market opportunities with a pull strategy and manage career movement by setting expectations around sharing talent.\nWhat we need to do is instead of designing careers around positions we need to design careers around experiences. Instead of still attempting to motivate employees with title progression we need to motivate them with employability. Instead of trying to pull employees into new positions through employee ownership we need to push the right opportunities to them. And finally rather than just setting expectations for managers to share talent, which quite frankly isn't making it happen, we need to create an environment that supports a talent brokerage instead.\nAnd these necessary shifts in approach represent a different model of career ownership where it's not just employee owned anymore, it's also proactively guided by the organisation, and we refer to this new approach as a career partnership, a career partnership better aligns employee and organisational interests and employee and organisational outcomes in the end. And what we know from our research over the past year and will see in the data as we talk more about why a career partnership works, is that career partnerships create reciprocal value for both the organisation and the employee and drive outcomes that matter to the business. So let me explain how we measure that.\nWe started today talking about how organisations are concerned about capability gaps in the future, we see a pending shortage of key skills in just the next 3-5 years and we also saw that 70% of employees are dissatisfied with career opportunities in their organisation. And what we've found is that career paths directly address both urgent challenges by increasing employee's career satisfaction. Let's talk for a moment about what that means and how it works.\nFirst let me explain what we mean by career satisfaction. We're not looking at a career satisfaction metric for this, simply a matter of measuring whether or not an employee tells us that they're satisfied with their career at their company. Our definition of career satisfaction is more specific, it is the extent to which an employer meets an employee's career interest compared to other employment options, and we think it make a lot of sense to have that external component to our measure of career satisfaction. Employees are consistently evaluating their current situation in the context of other options outside their current company, so we need to understand that perception in our measurement of their career satisfaction.\nAnd what we find through our analysis is that when employee's career satisfaction rises, as measured in this way, two things happen. We have employees building the skills that the organisation needs for the future which builds workforce capabilities and reduces the likelihood of future skill shortages and we have increased levels of employee engagement, which means high levels of intent to stay and increased discretionary effort.\nSo what's the impact of a career partnership on our approach to career satisfaction? Well, we can improve career satisfaction by up to 24% by designing careers around experiences compared to only 11% increase by designing career pathing around positions, even when we do that really well. When it comes to how we motivate employees we can improve employee's career satisfaction by up to 22% by focusing on how we're improving their employability through growth based careers.\nNow we do get a 17% potential lift from a focus on title progression, but it's also not a realistic option anymore, but it is really encouraging to know that employability can have a 22% impact on career satisfaction. And we get a huge impact from shifting how we market opportunities, a pull strategy clearly isn't working in terms of clearing the internal market or increasing employee satisfaction, but a push strategy can improve career satisfaction by over 30%.\nFinally when it comes to how we get our managers to better enable career growth creating a system for talent sharing, a talent brokerage in our language, can improve career satisfaction by 27%. And simply setting expectations for sharing talent is not getting movement to happen or career satisfaction to improve. So it's clear then when it comes to how we design careers, motivate employees, market opportunities and manage movement a career partnership has a significantly higher impact on career satisfaction than what we can achieve with employee ownership alone.\nSo this paints the agenda for the rest of our series, how do we move to a career partnership model that provides reciprocal value to the employee and the organisation by increasing employees career satisfaction, building employee engagement and building the workforce capabilities that the organisation needs for the future.\nThis podcast presented key findings from CEB's research on career pathing and a slide deck covering the information I've shared today is available for download on the website. Many thanks for joining us today and hope you'll join us again for our second podcast where we will focus on how we need to design careers to focus on experiences over positions.\nListen to the first episode of this five-part podcast series to learn:\nhow career satisfaction is affecting employee productivity\nwhy this should be a priority for HR and your board\nhow to future-proof your career pathing strategy.\nEpisode 2\nDuration: 00:18:36\nTranscript\nVoiceover: Welcome to the second in our series of five podcasts from CIPD and CEB on growth-based careers. The series will focus on CEB's research on the future of career pathing called The New Path Forward - Creating Compelling Careers for Employees and Organisations.\nIn this second episode we'll be discussing the development of experience rather than position based careers and take a closer look at how the National Grid use career mapping and an experience based approach to develop capabilities.\nFirst off here's Ksenia Zheltoukhova, research advisor at CIPD talking about a more individualised approach to career management and the responsibilities of both employers and employees for career development.\nKsenia Zheltoukhova: It's clear that the approaches to defining and managing employee careers are becoming increasingly individualised and complex. Although people might have a specific vision of how they want their working life to evolve they will be taking into account their responsibilities outside of work too. For example we know that 3 in 5 people will end up being a carer for someone at some point in their lives. Equally they will be thinking about availability of jobs more generally in the labour market and the modes of employment most suitable for their situation, such as being self-employed or taking a zero hour contract over permanent employment. As a result, employees will seek to make the most of their time with a specific organisation, gaining experiences that help them advance towards their career ambition beyond their current employer.\nThis new career model raises questions about the specific responsibility of employers in guiding individuals career planning and management. Is their responsibility limited to developing only such skills that are clearly relevant to the nature of operations or should it include development that is not immediately useful to the employer but can support the employee's future career path? Should the development opportunities be made available to anyone in an organisation or prioritised to include a small group of individuals in business critical roles?\nTo gather insight on the perceived responsibility for workers careers we conducted a series of focus groups with individuals working or looking for work in the UK. There were mixed reactions as to whether they expected their organisation to provide opportunities for career development or whether they saw this as their own responsibility. On the one hand people showed an understanding of the focus on continued self-improvement in order to stay competitive in the labour market, particularly this was relevant for self-employed individuals. On the other hand some respondents believed that the requirements of the job market, the needs of employers and also the availability of development opportunities were all outside of their control as an individual worker. Clearly while individuals may agree it's their responsibility to look after their own careers overall, some of them are still in the dark about the types of experiences that would lead them to their desired career goal or even ways to go about obtaining those experiences. In addition those feeling less in control of their career paths will expect much more guidance on career development opportunities from their organisation.\nTo glean the extent to which these expectations of people are matched by employers practice we have then conducted a separate survey with HR practitioners working in organisations of various sectors and sizes in the UK. First we asked the responders to provide their own definition of what talent means in their organisation. Interestingly only 2/10 respondents said that they had formally defined talent, although a further 4/10 suggested there is at least an informal agreement of what is meant by the term. More importantly in describing what talent stands for in their business the overwhelming majority of employers said it was relevant to the expertise that added value to the business or performance that contributed to the business objectives. This definition of talent translates into a particular type of offer that the majority of organisations appear to have when it comes to employee development.\nInitially nearly 9 out of 10 organisations had reported that everyone should be considered talent and supported to reach their potential, indicating prevalence for inclusive philosophies of talent management. Yet when reporting on the actual practices supporting employee development it seemed that in 3/10 organisations opportunities to enhance careers were only available to some workers, based on the value they could offer the employer. Furthermore 4/10 HR respondents said the same about availability of an attractive future with their organisation, also based on the potential value that the worker can add to the business.\nAnother interesting finding concerned the type of development opportunities provided by organisations, in our survey the majority of employers expressed a preference for managing talent according to their own organisations specific standards, so for example they would support employees to build their careers internally but not provide opportunities to pick up skills that could be transferred to other organisations. While understandable in the context of organisational interests to invest in value adding programmes and ensure that talented staff don't take their skills elsewhere, this approach may considerably limit the promise of employability that underpins the modern employment relationship.\nClearly some employees will be much more empowered than others to come up with a definition of their career goals, better positioned and more skilled to negotiate their career pathways, however others will need much more support. So what can employers do to support their organisations need for talent and performance while at the same time offering staff the types of experiences that can further their careers in the current organisation but also beyond. The way some employers are approaching this challenge shows that there are clear ways to meet both of these goals through smart design and management of growth based careers.\nVoiceover: Here's Nicola Josephs, Senior Executive Advisor at CEB talking about career partnerships and the shift from position to experience based careers.\nNicola Josephs: Today's careers are failing both employers and employees, organisations are concerned that we're going to be faced with capability gaps in the not too distant future and at the same time the overwhelming majority of employees, 70%, are currently dissatisfied with future career opportunities at their organisation and that dissatisfaction is driving departures. The reality though is that we just can't support promotion based career cultures anymore. So we need employees to think of their careers in terms of growth instead of narrowly focusing on how to get the next promotion.\nNow, I'll provide a quick reminder of how a growth based career culture looks different to a promotion based one. A promotion based career culture is all about the up, movement is largely vertical, driven by vacancies and there is little cross functional or cross silo movement. A growth based career culture is all about the build, employees are building and growing their capabilities through planned moves that are lateral and vertical and movement happens across silos and functions depending on growth opportunities and business needs. Based on the reality of the shape of the organisation and shifting needs of the business we need to shift our career culture from promotion based to growth based, we do that by creating career partnerships.\nOur current approach to careers involves us designing careers around positions, motivating employees through title progression, marketing opportunities with a pull strategy and managing career movement by setting expectations around sharing talent. What we need to do instead is design careers around experiences rather than designing careers around positions. Instead of still attempting to motivate employees with title progression we need to motivate with employability, instead of trying to pull employees into new positions through employee ownership we need to push the right opportunities to them and finally rather than just setting expectations for managers to share their talent we need to create an environment that supports a talent brokerage instead. These necessary shifts in approach represent a different model of career ownership where it's not just employee owned anymore, it's also pro-actively guided by the organisation, and we refer to this approach as a career partnership. A career partnership better aligns employee and organisational interests and employee and organisational outcomes in the end.\nSo, let's move into our focus for today by talking more about what we mean by shifting from position to experience based.\nRight now when it comes steering employees in their careers our idea of guidance is publishing specific career paths and providing employees with access to tools and plans that purport to lead them to specific positions and almost every organisation that we surveyed also shares the success stories of others who have made it through that career path the be like me and make it to the top of the organisation kind of story, inspirational and yet increasingly if we think about it unrealistic, unattainable and ultimately unhelpful because as we saw in our research our career paths become obsolete very quickly these days.\nMost heads of HR we talked to said that their career design is just fundamentally too inflexible. In a world of seemingly endless change, less than 20% of us have a career design that effectively adapts to changing needs. We had more than one member talk to us about career paths that become outdated almost as soon as they are published. So, in the end employees find our traditional career pathing efforts fairly unhelpful and only about a third of employees say that they have a good understanding of opportunities and needs in their own organisation, which means that while they still may be trying to climb the ladder we've described to them they're finding broken rungs and an unclear destination, or even a ladder to nowhere. The problem is that most of our career paths are still overly focused on positions. Now, I may be preaching to the converted here but, traditional career paths based on positions are simply unrealistic in today's environment and inflexible in the face of constant change, they don't focus enough on the relevant capabilities we need employees to be building. Position based career pathing is overly focused on articulating the series of what's, what position leads to what next position which leads you to what next position and so on. The path is all about a series of positions that seem to be clearly linked in a linear fashion to each other with the real focus being the destination and with an implicit promise of ongoing promotions. But, with the career complexity that employees face and evolving needs of the organisation, unless we help employees navigate careers better than posting a series of traditional career paths to positions that may or may not even exist in the midterm they're not going to be able to grow with the organisation and develop the capabilities that we and they need for the future.\nSo, instead we advocate focusing careers more on experiences than positions. Careers designed around experiences emphasise the path as much as the destination, but the path is not necessarily about linear connect the dots largely vertical progression because it's not about positions per se but about the key experiences that build necessary capabilities and the opportunities that provide those key experiences might not even be positions. When we're able to articulate and manage experiences it provides us with more flexibility to steer employees towards building the capabilities that are critical for the organisation.\nWhen careers are designed around experiences we see that can drive up career satisfaction by as much as 24% compared to up to only 11% for even well designed careers that are based on positions instead, think about why that is for a second. Careers designed more explicitly around experiences helps ensure that employees get the guidance they need to grow with the company, they're less likely to be frustrated around the lack of progression up the position pathway and they're more likely to be prepared when they do take on bigger roles.\nThe next question of course is how exactly do we do that? What does experience based career design even look like and how do you make it work? I want to talk about a really great example of how to do that with our case study from National Grid.\nNational Grid is a utilities company based in the UK and they stand out for us as a great example of orienting careers around experiences rather than positions. They've started this process by looking at key critical roles in their organisation and identifying the experiences needed to assume that kind of role. So it's not about just telling employees that they need to have a wide range of experiences but rather they've articulated a specific set of experiences that will build the right capabilities for these roles. For employees then, it's not about movement for movements' sake it's very intentional and transparent around why these experiences matter. Let me start by giving you an overview of National Grids new approach to career mapping.\nA couple of years ago National Grid decided to take a fresh look at how they did career pathing in the organisation with a goal of highlighting more of a holistic picture of how people can and should get the right developmental experiences across their career in order to eventually move into critical roles. They realised that the way they had historically looked at this was much too two dimensional and suggested career moves were really about climbing that proverbial ladder, instead they wanted to show the entire diverse journey that employees can take to grow into their career goals and they saw those as being about career maps rather than career paths and maps are intended to really highlight the multitude of different experiences that link entry level positions to senior level critical roles and in a more three dimensional way.\nTwo things in particular I want to highlight for you, the first piece is the approach they took determining the right experiences which is by working backwards from critical roles to determine the attributes or experiences that typically lead to success and building out the career maps from there. The second thing we really liked is their focus on the benefit of lateral moves and what they see as connector roles, a diverse range of different experiences that are distinctly laid out as being about career growth and ultimately career progression but primarily through lateral rather than vertical moves. For the employee then that helps build the logic and eliminate much of the perceived risk associated with taking a lateral move. Let's talk about each of these pieces in a bit more detail starting with how they reverse engineer, in a way, these career maps.\nThey start by identifying a set of business critical roles across the organisation and that helps to provide some definition and boundaries to the career maps, then they identify groups of experiences that build the capabilities need for that role. Now this immediately shows employees that getting to a particular career point is not about climbing up a series of positions but having the right range of experiences that you simply cannot get through a traditional linear career path, and then they also link these back to even entry level positions to show that everyone has the opportunity, with the right experiences, to move into these critical roles.\nSo, what's that take away here? That you need to start with the end in mind to frame the map and then you map primarily around experiences needed as opposed to positions acquired. The next piece gets into that middle set of what they call connector roles in more detail showing in particular how they ensure that employees see the benefits of these connector roles in terms of providing the right experiences. What National Grid has come to appreciate is that no single role gives you all the experiences you need to move up into another role, so they've sort of fractured the development experiences to show all the different ways you can get all the different experiences and build the right set of capabilities. So they'll start by looking at all the capabilities that are necessary for success in a particular critical role, then they outline the kind of different roles or experiences that help you build those sorts of capabilities and recognising that career success also comes from experiences outside of roles per se, they also highlight other ways in which people can develop those capabilities and that is one of our favourite parts of National Grids approach, because they think about how this kind of very thoughtful and holistic career and development map helps employees visualise all the different experiences they can pursue that will grow their capabilities in a way that leads to career growth. In terms of results our contacts at National Grid talk to us about both the organisational and the employee benefits to this new approach, to the organisation they feel more confident that their future leaders will have the right skills to lead the business and from the employees perspective they're finding that access to opportunities expanded because while they may not be the obvious candidate for a role the focus and transparency of the experience based approach encourages business leaders to take a broader perspective on appropriate candidates.\nThat brings me to the end of our discussion on how to design careers in the new work environment.

The series will focus on CEB's research on the future of career pathing called, The New Path Forward - Creating Compelling Careers for Employees and Organisations.\nThis month we are focusing on employability and the benefits to both employers and employees in taking a different approach to career development.\nFirst though, here is Nicola Josephs, senior executive advisor at CEB with a quick recap of what we've covered so far in the series.\nNicola: Today's careers are failing both employers and employees, organisations are concerned that we're going to be faced with capability gaps in the not too distant future. At the same time the overwhelming majority of employees, 70%, are currently dissatisfied with future career opportunities at their organisation, and that dissatisfaction is driving departures. The reality though is that we just can't support promotion based career cultures anymore. We need employees to think of their careers in terms of growth instead of narrowly focusing on how to get the next promotion.\nI will provide a quick reminder of how a growth based career culture looks different to a promotions based one. A promotion based career culture is all about the 'up' movement is largely vertical driven by vacancies and there is little cross function or cross silo movement. A growth based career culture is all about the build, employees are building and growing their capabilities through planned for moves that are lateral and vertical, and movement happens across silos and functions depending on growth opportunities and business needs and based on the reality of the shape of the new organisation and shifting needs of the business we need to shift our career culture from promotion based to growth based, we do that by creating career partnerships.\nOur current approach to careers involves us designing careers around positions, motivating employees through title progression, marketing opportunities with a pull strategy and managing career movement by setting expectations around sharing talent. What we need to do is instead of designing careers around positions we need to design them around experiences, instead of still attempting to motivate employees with title progression we need to motivate them with employability, instead of trying to pull employees into new positions through employee ownership we need to push the right opportunities to them and finally, rather than just setting expectations for managers to share talent we need to create an environment that supports a talent brokerage instead. These necessary shifts in approach represent a different model of career ownership, where it is not just employee owned any more, it's also pro-actively guided by the organisation and we refer to this new approach as a career partnership, a career partnership better aligns employee and organisational interests and employee and organisational outcomes in the end.\nVoiceover: It's clear that the employer employee relationship is changing, new research from CIPD suggests that the perception of employability is largely subjective and often determined by an employee's perceived value to their organisation. Here is Louisa Baczor, research associate at CIPD, discussing the findings and implications for businesses and their workforce.\nLouisa Baczor: We've seen a major shift in the work relationship over the past few decades, previously the employer side of the deal was about providing job security in return for loyalty to the organisation but now the deal is focused on supporting people's employability over the course of their careers and with multiple employers rather than employment in a single organisation.\nOn the face of it the focus on employability is advantageous for both employers and workers given the uncertainties in today's world of work. For employees it enables them to develop transferable skills and have more control over shaping their careers based on personal ambitions, for organisations it allows greater flexibility in shaping the workforce according to business need, but at the same time the responsibilities for both employers and employees in the work relationship have become less explicit making it more difficult for the two sides to hold each other to account. There is a risk of the balance of power shifting further towards employers who are no longer obliged to provide job security but can still choose which individuals receive job and development opportunities.\nThe new type of employment relationship raises questions about the degree of power and responsibility different agents have in supporting people's employability over the course of their careers. As suppliers of career and development opportunities, employers have choices to make over whether opportunities should be available to all employees or only those in business critical roles. What's the motivation for developing employee's career paths beyond the organisation for example? Compared with job security employability is a far more elusive concept, how do you define someone as employable? In its broadest sense employability is about realising ones career opportunities and aspirations but in the short term it is highly dependent on individuals securing jobs, so you can look at it from the perspective of individual characteristics such as ability and motivation, which enhance employability, but you could also look at it in terms of the contextual factors which influence whether an individual would be successful in getting a job or progressing in their job.\nOur new report, Attitudes to employability and talent towards a balanced work relationship, explores the attitudes towards employability and responsibilities for career development in the UK. Through focus groups with individuals working or looking for work as well as surveys of HR practitioners and line managers, we found that employability characteristics are associated with individual attributes such as skills and attitudes and are primarily defined by employers based on their assessment of individual's value to the organisation. The risk of focusing on such individual characteristics is that important external factors contributing to employability are down played, such as the supply and demand of skills in the labour market, so the onus on resolving employability issues is being shifted towards individuals, inevitably encouraging them to focus on short term career goals.\nLooking at employability through a narrow lens also risks creating pools of untapped talent for employers and may create a vicious circle of under or unemployment for groups with less bargaining power based on their skill levels or previous career history. Subjective perceptions of employers play a determining role in whether someone is seen as employable or talented and given access to development opportunities, for example we found that practitioners who had previous negative experiences of managing diversity in their organisations were less likely to target disadvantaged groups during recruitment and assigned lower average scores to these groups when assessing them against organisational definitions of talent. We also found differences in perceptions of different workforce groups, for example HR practitioners rated older workers as having a more positive attitude to work but lower potential to develop compared to young workers. Although nearly 9 out of 10 HR practitioners said that everyone should be considered as a talent and supported to reach their potential, when reporting on actual practices supporting employee development, 30% said opportunities to enhance careers were only available to some employees based on the value they could offer to the business. Responses of line managers showed that those in high skill roles or who are degree level qualified or have the skills that are hard to replace are more likely to be offered broad training and development opportunities, this approach to distributing opportunities is understandable, but it seems to undermine the premise of an employability based work relationship for some groups of workers. Those who do not already have the qualities that employers are looking for may miss out on opportunities to develop those making it difficult for them to manage their own careers.\nVoiceover: Here's Nicola Josephs once more, expanding on how businesses can help employees see the value in developing their employability and discussing LinkedIn's tours of duty as a way of creating mutual benefit for both employer and employee.\nNicola Josephs: Let's move into our focus for today by talking more about motivating our employees to see value in a growth based career culture in terms of improving their employability, both internally and externally.\nLet's talk about what this looks like and what we need to do about it. Most of us simply don't provide the opportunities for upward progression in position and in title that we were able to do in the past, in fact nearly half of employees say that it is harder to get promoted today than it was even just 5 years ago, think about that time frame, 5 years ago we were still largely in or just coming out of the great recession and still employees generally think it is harder or at least not easier to get promoted today. Even if upwards careers are highly motivating and engaging in theory they are largely a thing of the past. Our data also shows us that most of us agree that upward careers or promotion based careers are more characteristic of 10 years ago than today. The reality is that we simply have to get employees focused on and motivated by growth based career cultures instead of promotion based ones. The other side of the reality though is that right now they just don't see the benefits to them. Organisations are providing employees today with growth opportunities, stretch opportunities, job rotations, lateral moves and more, but while employees agree that these growth opportunities are present, they're not connecting them to their own personal progression. Employees see a disconnect, between career moves for growth and their own personal progression, less than a  1/4 of employees agree that career moves for growth, meaning not necessarily for promotion or vertical movement, help them advance and many see sideways moves as really being about a step backwards.\nWhat we need to do to motivate employees to care about a growth based career is focus them on employability instead of title progression. Let me overview what that means and why it matters to us and to our employees. Let me start with our definition of employability which is an employee's capability, skills, knowledge, experiences, achievements and personal attributes that make them more valuable to an employer and thus more likely to gain employment and achieve success in their career. That means internally or externally more employable, and employability is a worthy goal for both the individual and the organisation. For the employee of course it gives them more job security not necessarily within their own organisation but across the broader job market and for the organisation it creates a more flexible and higher quality workforce because of the focus on market competitiveness. What's really interesting is that increasing employee's employability actually increases their career satisfaction more than title progression does, but not only that, the more employable we make employees the less likely they are to leave. Increasing employability increases intent to stay by up to 21% and that's more than twice as much as increasing their title progression which means that employability builds loyalty.\nThe big question of course is, how do we get employees buy in for this shift from title progression to employability, what's the key to motivating employees to embrace the growth orientated career culture? First we need to demonstrate a credible commitment to building their employability, this can't just be a nice idea in theory. Employee's need to be able to trust that the organisation will deliver on their side of the agreement before they'll commit to theirs. That's what our case from LinkedIn is about, creating a mutual agreement with employees around what we're doing to build their employability and what the organisation gets in return. Second, we need to have honest conversations with employees about their employability and anchor career conversations around it so that they truly understand their employability. We've put together a composite case based on several real examples around how to have those honest conversations that centre on their internal and external employability and market value. Third, we also need to help employees communicate their value internally and externally.\nLet me share with you our case from LinkedIn and their tours of duty.\nThe term 'tour of duty' of course comes from the military where it refers to a specific assignment or deployment, usually for a specified period of time, LinkedIn has loosely taken that concept and created a new kind of career framework with the underlying principle being reciprocity. The company and the employee form, potentially, a series of incremental alliances called tours of duty, and they establish up front how these tours will be mutually beneficial. Each tour of duty is 2-4 years with a pre-determined time frame for re-evaluation by both sides. When a tour is over there are basically two options, first, form a renewal agreement for another tour of duty potentially even very different from the first or two end the agreement and move on. If and when a tour is not renewed the company helped the employee find a job elsewhere, why? Because that's part of the terms of the agreement. Both parties make an agreement in terms of the tour of duty, so the organisation promises to clearly define the role, expectations, success measures and so on and agrees to help the employee advance their career either internally or externally by making them more employable. In return, the employee agrees to complete that mission or tour of duty as outlined and positively impact the business, the exchange that LinkedIn sees is that the employees invest of themselves to build the companies adaptability and the company invest in the employee to build their employability. That's what each of these tours of duty outline for both, explicit terms for each in terms of how each party will progress and benefit. What LinkedIn sees as the real benefit of this new approach to the employability contract is that it creates a realistic zone of trust and a much more honest mutually productive relationship.\nWhile we fully appreciate that not every organisation can and would want to fully embrace the tour of duty concept across their organisation, there are ways to think about how you might try this framing, perhaps in a pilot approach, in different parts of the organisation. For example you might identify and target certain roles in the organisation where deep organisational knowledge isn't required but where the organisation benefits from regular new perspectives and employees would find it a stronger builder of skills or the tour of duty concept might be really appealing to certain segments of employees that prefer the nature of a short term assignment; high potentials, early career employees, maybe millennials or even late career employees looking for a set of diverse experiences to which they could contribute. Finally there are likely roles that are already more project based or time frame specific, perhaps that's the place to pilot a tour of duty concept.\nWe like the example of LinkedIn as standing for our first imperative if demonstrating incredible commitment to employability and the way they've done that through establishing a new employment contract with employees based on mutual reciprocity and two way value and in a way that is motivating to their employees.\nThat brings me to the end of our discussion on how to motivate employees to buy into careers designed around experiences by helping them to see the value in a growth based career culture in terms of improving their employability internally and externally. As a reminder this podcast presented key findings from CEBs research on career pathing and a slide deck covering the information I shared today is available to download on the website.

The series focuses on CEBs research on the future of career pathing called The New Path Forward - Creating Compelling Careers for Employees and Organisations.\nThis month we are focusing on how businesses can improve their marketing of opportunities to the internal labour market.\nHere's Ed Houghton, research advisor at CIPD, discussing the need for new approaches to career development and the ways in which organisations can build talent management strategies to ensure talent remains in the business.\nEd Houghton: At the CIPD we know that the traditional career paths are no longer fit for purpose and do not fit the needs of the modern workforce. As you will have heard from previous episodes in this series, promotion based career path strategies are no longer enabling the engagement and retention of workers. They are instead based on old models which are highly process orientated and do not fit the unique needs of the workforce. Organisations now must consider new approaches to developing individual careers with a view to upskilling and improving capability, whilst providing flexibility and the opportunity to experience different aspects of a career in both a short and long timeframe.\nFinding the talent internally and ensuring that a ready supply is accessible and willing to fill these roles is part of the succession planning process in the HR system. It is crucial that internal marketing processes must be aligned to the succession planning approach that has been applied by the HR function. Succession planning is the way by which the HR team identifies and develops potential future leaders or senior managers in the business. Those who are lined to fill business critical positions can either move into roles in the short or long term. Succession planning often includes training and development as well as the provision of practical experience, either internally or externally to the business. It is through these processes that talent will be identified and allocated accordingly to the correct pools of current or future roles. The marketing process that serves this is in essence in place to ensure that individuals are aware of these opportunities and understand the development needed to meet these new role competencies.\nWe have done a lot of research which explores the structure of roles in organisations and have found that many organisations are redefining their structures and are applying more flexibility in the way that they structure their roles. This is positive and lends itself well to the needs of the current workforce which are to experience roles that are both laterally and vertically aligned to their current positions. What can be challenging however is how we market these opportunities across the business to attract internal talent to apply for these positions. We want to understand how better to push some of these internal opportunities to our internal staff, to ensure that these opportunities are available to individuals and that they recognise them as viable opportunities that can help them to deliver and develop their own unique career path. This is particularly true when a role may not be immediately obvious to somebody as a good opportunity to build their career portfolio.\nMany employees will still be focused on the traditional route of progression through the organisation which is upwards and as such will be looking to move along this way of progression. There is some need to educate the workforce to some of these horizontal opportunities which may be available to them. In our research we've looked at ways in which organisations can build in talent management strategies that ensure the talent remains in the business but also stretches the skills of individuals so new competencies are developed. In our talent management research insight we produced a case study of Gordon Ramsey holdings in which trainee kitchen staff are provided with secondment opportunities to develop skills via new experiences in the workplace as well as test out roles before applying for them, often in high performing parts of the organisation. This model allowed individuals to test out new roles and stretch their capability, when individuals wished to move financial incentives of performance were introduced to drive performance on an individual and team level. The marketing for these positions was experiential, based on the secondment opportunities providing an insight into what these roles entailed, for this case study this meant that talent was suited to the stretch that came from these new internal opportunities.\nFinally it helps to consider the employer brand from the internal perspective, our research insight, Employer branding: a no nonsense approach, looked closely at how organisations can apply a simple, but effective, approach to building a strong employer brand which connects the values, people strategy and HR policies so that there is a clear sense of the company brand being conveyed by the business. Actively engaging social media to internally communicate opportunities is a good way of pushing these opportunities to employees across the business, increasing transparency and making employees aware of these new roles which are available to them. You can find out more about this research in our research report: Social technology, social business.\nVoice over: Here's Nicola Josephs, senior executive advisor at CEB exploring the internal marketing opportunities in organisations and how changing marketing strategies can help to better align the organisational needs with the career interests of their employees.\nNicola Josephs: Today's careers are failing both employers and employees. Organisations are concerned that we are going to be faced with capability gaps in the not too distant future and at the same time, the overwhelming majority of employees, 70%, are currently dissatisfied with future career opportunities at their organisation and that dissatisfaction is driving departures. The reality though is that we just can't support promotion based career cultures anymore. So we need employees to think of their careers in terms of growth instead of narrowly focussing on how to get the next promotion.\nI'll provide a quick reminder of how a growth based career culture looks different to a promotions based one. A promotion based career culture is all about the up, movement is largely vertical driven by vacancies and there is little cross functional or cross silo movement. A growth based career culture is all about the build. Employees are building and growing their capabilities through planned for moves that are lateral and vertical and movement happens across silos and functions depending on growth opportunities and business needs. Based on the reality of the new shape of the organisation and shifting needs of the business we need to shift our career culture from promotion based to growth based. We do that by creating career partnerships.\nOur current approach to careers involves us designing careers around positions, motivating employees through title progression, marketing opportunities with a pull strategy and managing career movement by setting expectations around sharing talent. What we need to do is instead of designing careers around positions we need to design careers around experiences. Instead of still attempting to motivate employees through title progression, we need to motivate with employability. Instead of trying to pull employees to new positions through employee ownership, we need to push the right opportunities to them. Finally, rather than just setting expectations for managers to share talent, we need to create an environment that supports a talent brokerage instead. These necessary shifts in approach represent a different model of career ownership where it's not just employee owned anymore it's also pro-actively guided by the organisation, we refer to this new approach as a career partnership. A career partnership better aligns employee and organisational interests and employee and organisational outcomes in the end.\nSo let's move into our focus for today by talking about how to improve our marketing to the internal labour market. Here we are going to be looking at how we need to change our marketing strategy to better align organisational needs with the career interests of employees through a push rather than a pull strategy. One thing that was really interesting to us in the course of our interviews is how many members told us that while their employers constantly complain that there are not enough opportunities in their organisation, the organisation is constantly having to go outside for talent. Certainly there are some reasons why you would want or need to tap into the external market but we feel like a real miss-match does exist between perception and reality when it comes to internal opportunities. Members who told us that opportunities do exist across the organisation but employees just don't see it. Less than one out of three employees believe there are sufficient career opportunities at their organisation, so how do we better market and connect employees to the opportunities that do exist?\nWell right now we're taking the wrong approach. We're employing a classic pull approach when it comes to marketing our opportunities to our employees, meaning a strategy that relies on the employee themselves to seek out all the available opportunities through a variety of channels like job boards, networking, job fairs and so on. We provide the information or the opportunities and we wait for the employees to come to us. The problem is, they don't, or if they do they don't find it particularly helpful.\nAlmost two thirds of employees today are open to, if not actively searching for, new opportunities, but the way that we're providing that information about opportunities to them now is overwhelming and not particularly useful. Three quarters of employees say they can't prioritise the information about different roles, they can't understand the information that we do provide and we make it really hard for them to evaluate whether or not the role is right for them. Clearly a lot of pull approaches end up pushing employees away instead and it's not helping us connect the right opportunities to the right employees at the right time. What we need to do instead is market internal opportunities to our employees with push strategies, let me explain what that looks like. A push strategy is all about targeting the right internal opportunities to the right employees at the right time, which means building awareness of opportunities before the employees even actively looking. There are three key pieces to a push strategy, by right opportunity we mean that we need to make sure that we understand employee's interests and aspirations and push the right opportunities to them. By right audience we mean that we need to be marketing opportunities to passive candidate's not just active ones. The right time is before they become dissatisfied and actively looking outside our organisation, by then it's too late. This is a big opportunity for most organisations, because right now only about 6% of us have push career strategies.\nLet me start by talking about how we push the right opportunities, meaning opportunities that actually align with employee aspirations, skills and interests with our case study from HCL Technologies and their social career navigation system. With HCL, which is an IT services company based in India, we wanted to share with you how they specifically oriented their career navigation system to understanding and guiding employees aspirations to the right opportunities for both them and the organisation, we think there are some great take aways here regardless of whether or not you have a career platform in place or what functionality it includes.\nLet's start with what HCL was trying to solve for. What HCL told us they were finding really frustrating was that in one part of the organisation they'd find themselves losing talent who said they couldn't find any opportunity to grow, and then in another part of the organisation they would have hiring managers searching for new talent to bring in with similar skill sets to the departing talent and at 30-40% higher cost. So they were incurring the cost of losing valuable employees and they were incurring hiring costs to bring the similar profiles in. This situation highlighted for HCL a couple of key challenges they were facing, first that their employees were struggling to not only find the right opportunities for them across the business but to find out what skill sets the company even valued.\nSecondly the organisation lacked visibility into what employees were seeking and a mechanism to guide them to experiences that would help them develop the skill sets the organisation needed. Let me explain how they have addressed both of these challenges with their new approach to not just generally providing more career visibility but to also uncovering aspirations so they can push the right opportunities to them that connect aspirations with the needs of the business, we'll start by looking at how they focus on understanding and steering aspirations. So a central adage in marketing is 'know your customer' and of course the benefit is then that you get to better sell the right products to your customer, that's really what HCL is doing here, getting to know their customer and also inform their customer with customers being their own employees. What they are trying to know and inform are their employee's aspirations so that they can push the right opportunities to them.\nSo, how do they do this? First employees go into their career connect career portal and browse through different career aspirations, they can select up to two, so basically two roles within the company that they aspire to. That's the anchoring point that's going to eventually enable HCL to push to them internal opportunities that best align to their aspirations and with the needs of the business. Next step, they schedule discussions with a range of potential councillors to help them pressure test those selected aspirations, they can select their direct managers as one of the councillors or someone from HR, but HCL also provides, through career connect, the names of a number of functional experts who are available to have career discussions around that specific aspiration. Next step then, the employees will finalise their aspirations given those discussions and additional information that the employee has seen regarding specific business demand and then finally they will put together their development plan based on feedback from their councillors as well as peers who've pursued a similar path, the development plans are all posted online.\nLet's pause for a moment, what we find particularly new here is that employees have ownership over their career aspirations and development plan but enough input and even challenge from enough informed sources that the employee is guided to pursue experiences that the company values. It's not about limiting aspiration at all, it's really about channelling it. Once the employees have selected their aspiration the company can then push relevant opportunities to them in a couple of different ways. First is through targeted outreach based on business needs, so for example if business leaders identify new capability needs given business priorities they'll partner with HR to determine the relevant skill sets and related aspirations, HR can then go into the career connect portal and search for employees who've selected those aspirations and reach out to them pro-actively to let them know about the new opportunities that are related to their aspirations and that are prioritised by the company. Employees can then re-tag their aspirations to the new ones and build a new accelerated development plan for this new opportunity. I also want to briefly mention have they not only sent targeted opportunities to employees based on their aspirations but also how they look at informing and potentially redirecting aspirations for the long term.\nHCL also encourages their businesses to promote particular growth areas directly to all employees through the career connect portal that keeps employees up to date on growth and investment areas of the firm and helps them understand how to connect their own career to these growth opportunities. They can even point out specific aspirations on the career connect portal that are linked to this kind of growth area and highlight ways to get the right development and then once again employees can go back into the portal and update their aspirations, get more feedback from career councillors and update their development plan and so on. So the information that the company provides employees allows them to contextualise their aspirations selection around what capabilities the company prioritises so that individual and the organisation can stay aligned and the organisation can continue to push relevant opportunities to the employees.\nThey have already seen some very strong results today. They were recently highlighted in the international business journal as being the only company where the attrition rates for IT majors was not going up, in fact of the employees who have submitted and then revoked their notice over the last 2 quarters 65% of those saves were said to be attributable to career connect. Also important benefit articulated by the client was that by channelling employees aspirations and development they're also better able to provide the business with talented skills and the capabilities that the business requires and that really gets to the challenge that we talked about earlier, the perceived miss-match between employees and the organisation in terms of the opportunities that actually do exist in the organisation. It's about making sure that we can understand and direct employee's aspirations and development to the right experiences and then pushing those opportunities directly to them.\nThat brings me to the end of our discussion on how to better market our internal opportunities. As a reminder this podcast presented key findings from CEBs research on career pathing and a slide deck covering the information I've covered today is available to download on the website. Many thanks for joining us today and I hope you will join us for our fifth and final podcast where we will focus on the manager, and specifically about how we address the seeming perennial challenge we struggled with about how we get managers to stop hoarding talent and making sure that movement for career growth is actually happening.\nIn this episode we discuss the need to use push rather than pull marketing strategies to build awareness of internal opportunities. Listen to learn:\nHow businesses can improve marketing of opportunities to the internal labour market.\nThe challenges of a push marketing strategy and how to implement one in your organisation.\nWhy push marketing strategies are essential to retaining talent.\nEpisode 5\nDuration: 00:22:10\nTranscript\nVoice over: Welcome to the final episode in our series from CIPD and CEB on growth-based careers.\nThe series focuses on CEB's research on the future of career pathing called: The New Path Forward - Creating Compelling Careers for Employees and Organisations.\nThis month we're focusing on the line manager and how organisations can develop a system of talent brokerage to encourage the sharing of talent, and ensure that critical skills can be accessed where they are most needed across the business.\nBut first, here's Nicola Josephs, Senior executive advisor at CEB with a quick recap of what the series has covered so far.\nNicola Josephs: Today's careers are failing both employees and the employer, organisations are concerned that we are going to be faced with capability gaps in the not too distant future and at the same time the overwhelming majority of employees, 70%, are currently dissatisfied with future career opportunities at their organisation and that dissatisfaction is driving departures. The reality though is that we just can't support promotion based career cultures anymore so we need employees to think of their careers in terms of growth instead of narrowly focusing on just how to get that next promotion.\nLet me provide a quick reminder of how a growth based career culture looks different to a promotion based one. A promotion based career culture is all about up, movement is largely vertical driven by vacancies and there is little cross function or cross silo movement. A growth based career culture  is all about the build, employees are building and growing their capabilities through planned for moves that are lateral and vertical and movement happens across silos and functions depending on growth opportunities and business needs. Based on the reality of the shape of the organisation and the shifting needs of the business we need to shift our career culture to focus on growth rather than promotions and we do that by creating career partnerships.\nOur current approach to careers involves us designing careers around positions, motivating employees through title progression, marketing opportunities with a pull strategy and managing career movement by setting expectations around sharing talent. What we need to do is instead of designing careers around positions we need to design careers around experiences, instead of attempting to motivate employees with title progression we need to motivate with employability, instead of trying to pull employees into new positions through employee ownership, we need to push the right opportunities to them and finally rather than just setting expectations for managers to share talent we need to create an environment that supports a talent brokerage instead. These necessary shifts in approach represent a different model of career ownership where it's not just employee owned anymore it's also pro-actively guided by the organisation, we refer to this new approach as a career partnership. A career partnership better aligns employee and organisational interests and employee and organisational outcomes in the end.\nVoice over: Research from CIPD's Attitudes to Employees and Talent report suggest that organisations need to do more to develop a shared understanding around their talent strategy.\nHere's David Hayden, L&D Consultant at CIPD, discussing the research and how the HR and L&D professionals can help their organisations move towards a growth-based career model by defining more clearly their talent strategies and supporting better access to career opportunities for their employees.\nDavid Hayden: So if we are serious about changing the perspective of designing our career experiences within an organisation from the traditional ladder and position based approach to a more of a growth based approach experience with vertical lateral approaches then we need to think about how we manage this. We need to consider who are the main players in this? Three groups jump out to me straight away. The HR and L&D practitioners, the line managers and the specific employees themselves. Within this podcast it may appear that we are piling pressure on the line manager, reverting to the default position of blaming them for not sharing talent. I want you to take a step back for a minute and think about the context the line managers are operating within and what may need to happen to support them fully, thus allowing them to embrace the concept of talent brokerage. I want the HR and L&D community to think about three things in how they can support the move to a growth based approach.\nFirstly how joined up are our approaches?\nSecondly do we have a common definition of our talent strategy?\nThirdly what support do we offer our employees to access their career opportunities, as well as challenge any potential barriers?\nLet's look at each of these in turn.\nFirstly how joined up are our approaches?\nWe need to think about the messages we send out to our managers and which of the messages land and which have priority for the receiver - let me give an example here - in a world where managers are targeted to cut costs, deliver quicker and do more with less, then we have to ask ourselves is it not surprising that they can fiercely protect the workforce they have developed.\nWe also need to consider how this approach is linked to other aspects such as our reward strategies - are managers rewarded on their own outputs or on the wider organisational outputs - is there an imbalance between what may be on our values and our website - for instance \"we value teamwork\" and individual performance bonuses- does this approach foster a culture of sharing resources?\nLooking at recruitment where the associated costs may well sit with the hiring operations manager: they need to recoup that cost as quickly as possible - so for the new starter, time spent understanding the rest of the business may well be minimal.  If the cost came out of a central pool then would the line managers be more receptive to sharing their resources?\nThe final example in this section on our joined up approaches is how do we communicate to - and develop our line managers - do we encourage them to develop their staff, do we allow time and space for this to happen?  Do we harvest stories of success and share these across the organisation?\nSecondly in thinking about how we can support a growth based approach - do we have a common definition of our talent strategy?\nThe CIPDs September 2016 research report on Attitudes to Employability and Talent highlighted some fascinating stats.  The research base of over 1000 HR practitioners shows\nalmost three in ten practitioners (28%) admitted to having no definition, despite having a strategy in place for the organisation and its people\nabout half of all respondents (499) then provided their definition of talent in an open-ended format\nonly 22% of respondents said their organisation had a formal definition of 'talent' as part of their strategy\n42% suggested that there is at least an informal agreement of what is understood by the concept of talent\nWhat do these stats tell us - well let's look at the 22% first - they have a clear definition of talent - at least that is explicit and can be shared - but what about the 42% suggesting that there is at least an informal agreement on what is understood - and the 499 respondents who suggest that there is an open-ended format -  how can the HR and L&D teams be sure that there is a common understanding across the whole  organisation - does this allow for interpretation or confusion and a lack of clarity around the purpose and direction of the talent strategy? And then, what is the impact around that lack of clarity across the organisation?\nThe challenge for HR and L&D practitioners here again is clarity and support and targeted communication with a joined up approach.\nThe third point I would like to make in building a growth based career approach is what support do we offer our employees to access their career opportunities and challenge any potential barriers?\nThe CIPD along with Halogen software produced the HR Outlook Autumn 2016 edition, and there are some interesting insights which the HR and L&D profession can link to this to the concept of career brokerage.  The outlook was based on a You.Gov poll with over 2000 employees responding. Key highlights include:\nEmployees say that their managers are most likely to be very well/fairly well committed to their organisation (70%)\nOn the other hand, employees are most likely to say their managers are fairly poor or very poor at, keeping them in touch with what is going on around 25%, discussing training and development needs is also fairly poor or very poor at 23% and also at 23% fairly poor or very poor is the line manager acting as a role model in the organisation.\nThis tells us that potentially we have a pool of supportive managers who are committed to the organisation, so if we get the communication element right, then we can harness this large group of managers to be advocates of the process of supporting an alternative career development programme. However, there is a pool that needs to have some significant development in the areas of\nKeeping in touch with what's going on\nDiscussion L&D\nBeing a role model\nMore than two-fifths (46%) of employees strongly agree or agree that their organisation provides them with opportunities to learn and grow. However, just over a quarter (27%) disagree or strongly disagree that they have the opportunity to learn and grow - 27%!\nAgain this offers a starting point to build upon and form an understanding of the challenges we face in balancing the career aspirations of the employees and balance that with the needs of the organisation to address this.  It is also worth revisiting the promises and signposts we make in the recruitment process and the messages that are implied within the careers pages of your website\nIn conclusion to the three points made around developing a career growth based approach: we need to ensure that\nOur approaches, policies, practices, communication and development messages are joined up\nWe have a common definition of our talent strategy?\nAnd we support our employees, and their managers, to access a variety of career opportunities, and support them in the way they can challenge any potential barriers?\nNicola Josephs: Let's move into our focus for today by talking about the manager and specifically about how we address the seeming perennial challenge we struggled with in terms of getting managers to stop hording talent and making sure that movement for career growth is actually happening.\nI don't think it's a surprise to anyone listening that talent hording continues to be a problem at most organisations, 6/10 heads of HR said that their managers were unwilling to share talent with other managers in the organisation. Let's think for a moment about how we're trying to get them to share talent, we tell them it is something that they have to do, that they need to let their talent go and that it's good for the firm. What all that says to the manager is that whether it's through altruism or sheer martyrdom, you need to export your talent and then we wonder why it doesn't happen and why employees aren't able to get the career movement that they need to continue to grow. So, what do we do? Well now we get serious and we try to put firm expectations in place through their objectives. Because managers don't seem to be naturally willing to share talent we've been trying to attach more teeth to our expectations with nearly half of organisations trying to hold managers accountable for exporting talent through their MBOs or goals, but what we found is that setting clear expectations for talent sharing does not necessarily generate more talent sharing. In organisations where managers do not have MBOs related to sharing talent 39% are willing to let their talent move, and in organisations where managers do have MBOs related to sharing talent 40% are willing talent exporters, essentially the same amount. What this tells us is that making sure that managers understand the organisations expectation for them to share talent even through formal goals is insufficient, what we need to do instead of simply setting expectations is enabling it to happen through a talent brokerage.\nLet me explain what that means and how that changes both the willingness and ability of managers to share talent across the organisation. So talent brokerage is about providing stakeholders with the information, access and governance needed to effectively share talent across the organisation. Having a talent brokerage increases manager's willingness to share talent by 50% and it also increases employee's career satisfaction because movement for career growth is more likely to happen. Let's talk more about how that works and what we mean and don't mean by these key components of a talent brokerage. First a talent brokerage requires managers to have the right information about talent across the organisation and that means access to information about their skills not just employee profiles, that's where you see the biggest impact on career satisfaction. Second there must be a system in place that supports both the give and the get when it comes to sharing talent, but of course the talent brokerage also has to have some regulation or governance as well to make sure that moves are productive. When we compare the impact of a talent brokerage where managers have access to information about employee skills, where they are encouraged to both import and export talent and where there is appropriate regulation to simply setting expectations to share talent we see that we get a significantly larger impact on employee career satisfaction through talent brokerage.\nLet's discuss our pseudonym case study from Cyber Company that addresses the need to provide managers with information about skills not just employees and also ensures that they're creating a market place that helps managers import not just export talent. Cyber Company is a pseudonym for a company in the engineering industry based in the US and we think their case stands as a great example of how to show managers the benefits of a talent brokering and provide them with the right system to make it happen. With Cyber they do this by making sure their managers know what critical skills they need on their team, what they currently have and where they've got the biggest risks and where they can fill those gaps. So it's not just about telling managers to share talent and assume risks simply because it is good for the broader organisation, it's about creating a business based urgency to share talent centred on managers knowing the capabilities they need to fulfil their business needs, this helps shift the managers mind set from risk to reward when it comes to sharing talent. What Cyber has done to address that is created a mechanism to help managers build a catalogue of critical skills inventory that's about the what not the who, so lifting out of the individual and focusing more on what do they have that the business really needs. Cyber now makes it the responsibility of each manager to go through the process of identifying the skills portfolio that's critical to them, so they provide managers a number of questions that they are asked to consider in order to build out their critical skills portfolio. They are asking managers to think about skills in the context of the business needs current or future that are difficult to source or develop, that require long term investment and that are necessary for differentiating the business, delivering to customers and so on. It's no longer about asking the manager who's really important on your team and if they left you you would be in a lot of trouble because that leaves the manager to focus on individual people, so you're not profiling Sally you are profiling the skill. That is what this exercise is all about, identifying skills that are imperative to the current or future business needs and making the manager responsible for ensuring that they've got the right inventory of those skills to meet the needs of the business. Two important notes about this part of the exercise, first that the managers define the critical skills themselves not the organisation so that the manager has ownership over identifying what is relevant and critical to their part of the organisation. Second, a great thing about this part of the process, is that because each manager is going through this process through their own lens but with a similar discipline and focus on objective assessment of business criticality the managers are building a greater trust around the assessment of employees skills which is helping smooth the hurdle around managers feeling they can't get an objective assessment of talent at they might want to import. After the manager identifies their critical skills portfolio and how many people they need with those skills the next step is to help managers understand where they have got gaps and risks in their skills portfolio.\nWhat I want to discuss here is how this kind of risk assessment creates self-awareness on the part of the manager and urgency around maintaining the right balance in their portfolio. Cyber created a simple visual tool that outlines the results of the assessment of critical skills, they list the names of the team manager who have done each of these assessments and then next to the name are the details around each of their skills portfolio. So first they indicate the number of critical skills they've identified for their skill portfolio and then the number of experts and proteges they have across each of those critical skills and all that information is assessed and input directly by the manager, so they have assessed each of their employees in terms of their proficiency levels in those skills, those with the highest level of capability are termed experts and those still mastering the skills are proteges, this is their bank, their supply when it comes to their skills portfolio. They also input into the system how many people they need with each of the skills, so what's the demand, and then they system does the calculation to determine whether any of the skills in the managers critical skills portfolio are at a risk based on whether there are enough experts or proteges in the portfolio for each critical skill, it then highlights through colour coding if there is a high, medium or low risk associated with any of the skills. What this does is put a spotlight on what skills the manager needs to pro-actively manage in their skills portfolio, they can look at the report and say 'what's my exposure and where's my urgency' and this self-awareness now catalyses them to think about where they need to import talent, around what skill area, to be able to maintain their portfolio strength and support the business.\nLet's take this outside the technology for a moment, this is not about spreadsheets and colour coding you don't need to have a system underpinning this like Cyber does. This is about making sure your managers know what skills they need, know what skills they've already got on their teams and that they've got visibility into gaps that might be putting their business at risk. This is the information that creates both a business sense of urgency to participate in a talent brokerage as well as enabling managers to understand exactly what they need from a business perspective because they know their risk levels and they will discuss these risks with their peers and executives in talent reviews. In talent reviews now executives will highlight to their teams places where there is an indication of high risk in terms of specific critical skills in their portfolio, the conversation then centres on how to ensure that risk gap is closed, either by further developing a protege in the pipeline or importing talent from elsewhere in the organisation. While the fact that the system calculates a risk level drives the urgency to import talent the fact that executives and peers are also focusing on skills gaps also creates another type of soft accountability that's spurs action as well.\nCyber has also focused on making that search for skills as easy as possible for managers. The skills portfolio system that catalogues all critical skills and skill levels of employees is also a searchable database that managers can use to identify employees who can round out their skills needs, then the manager in need can reach out to the manager or the employee to get more information in case they potentially want to import that specific talent if they're available, obviously they will check with the employees current manager before proceeding with the recruiting process, but it gives managers a credible and easy way to search for talent that has the skills they need to import. This is a key part of the market place they've created to help managers directly broker talent. In terms of results, what we've heard from Cyber is that from managers perspective it increases the trust they have around talent from other parts of the organisation because of the discipline in rating for skills, ultimately helping them locate talent they want to import and for HR they're seeing more trust developing between managers about talent sharing when HR is taken out of the equation.\nIf we are serious about changing the perspective of designing career experiences within an organisation from a traditional ladder and position based approach to more of growth based experience, vertical, lateral approach then we need to think about how we manage this.\nThat concludes our podcast series on creating compelling careers in the new work environment.
