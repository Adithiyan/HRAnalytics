      "full_text": "At the September EN:Insights Forum, Executive Network members heard about SHRM’s latest research exploring the state of employer-employee relationships in the U.S. labor market, drawing on insights from workers, job seekers, and HR leaders.\n\n“Employer and employee power dynamics are a key driver of workplace behavior,” said Ragan Decker, Ph.D., SHRM’s manager of Executive Network and Enterprise Solutions research. “In our new research, we found that 57% of HR leaders say it significantly influences their employer’s decisions, and 50% of workers say it significantly influences how they behave at work.”\n\nHere are five critical insights from the research.\n\nResearch Insight 1: Employers and employees are deeply divided about who holds the upper hand.\n\nWho holds more power today—workers or employers?\n\nUnemployed job seekers\n\nWorkers: 13%Balanced: 6%Employers: 81%\n\nWorkers\n\nWorkers: 18%Balanced: 20%Employers: 62%\n\nHR leaders\n\nWorkers: 57%Balanced: 20%Employers: 23%\n\n“This data really highlights how important perceptions are when thinking about power dynamics in the U.S. labor market,” Decker said. “Despite labor shortages, many workers and job seekers are feeling like employers hold more power.”\n\nResearch Insight 2: Many workers—especially unemployed job seekers—don’t feel confident that they could find a new job with similar pay and benefits within three months.\n\nWorkers Who Feel Confident About Finding Comparable Jobs\n\nUnemployed job seekers\n\nNot at all confident: 46%Somewhat confident: 42%Confident: 9%Very confident: 4%\n\nWorkers\n\nNot at all confident: 21%Somewhat confident: 35%Confident: 25%Very confident: 18%\n\n“With such low confidence about finding a comparable job among workers and job seekers, why do so many HR leaders say the labor market is strongly or moderately in favor of workers?” Decker asked. “HR leaders cite rising expectations among employees and the talent gap as two of the top factors affecting that balance of power.\n\nResearch Insight 3: Just 29% of HR leaders say they’re satisfied with the availability of qualified candidates when filling their open positions.\n\nFactors HR leaders see affecting the balance of power:\n\nEmployee expectations and demands: 64%Availability of skilled workers: 62%Economic environment: 58%Generational attitudes toward work: 55%The organization’s financial performance: 55%Government regulations/labor laws: 38%Tech advancements affecting the workplace: 24%Strength of labor unions: 8%\n\n“According to SHRM’s most recent talent trends research, one in four organizations are reporting that full-time, regular positions they’ve hired for in the last 12 months required new skills due to changing technology,” Decker said.\n\n“HR leaders feel it is more of an employee-driven market because they’re struggling to meet workers’ expectations and feel there is a lack of qualified candidates. Workers tend to feel it is more of an employer-driven market, partially because employers aren’t meeting their expectations, and may feel that they’re lacking the skills needed for many of the jobs that are open.”\n\nResearch Insight 4: Workers have higher expectations for the organizations where they work and feel comfortable demanding more from their employers. More than 60% of workers say they hold organizations to a higher standard than they did five years ago, and 85% say workers should feel comfortable demanding more from their employers.\n\nWorkers would quit, even in an employer-driven market due to unmet expectations with:\n\nCompensation: 70%Benefits: 57%Advancement opportunities: 47%\n\n“I think it’s important to think about what this actually means in terms of behavior,” Decker said. “Despite some misalignment between HR leaders and workers about who holds more power, workers do have higher expectations and are even willing to leave their jobs if their expectations aren’t met.”\n\nResearch Insight 5: Organizations are motivated to adapt to the evolving employer-employee power dynamic amid a talent gap.\n\nOrganizations have responded by increasing:\n\nStarting salaries: 42%Training and development: 41%Base salaries or wages: 38%\n\n“Our findings underscore the reality that—for all their value—the metrics most often used to measure U.S. labor market health do not necessarily align with the perceptions of individual workers. Organizations should be mindful of this gap when developing strategies to attract and retain talent,” Decker concluded.\n\n\n\nJustin Ladner, SHRM Senior Labor Economist: Pandemic Effects Are Softening, but Big Demographic Changes Loom\n\nJustin Ladner is a SHRM senior labor economist. His work centers on examining labor market trends and emerging issues facing employers and employees. He has extensive experience researching occupational mobility, personnel training, recruiting, and retention, being particularly passionate about leveraging data and analytics to inform real-world policy improvements. Ladner holds a master’s degree and Ph.D. in economics from the University of Michigan.\n\nOne point Ladner emphasized is how the aging workforce in the U.S. will influence the labor market in different ways.\n\n“Organizations are going to be employing people who are older workers, and the timing of their important life decisions has changed. Now, childbearing is concentrated in people’s 30s and even 40s. That means the needs of people having children are going to be really different. Increasingly, those parents are providing caretaking services to young children while simultaneously providing them to older adults. This will drive the decisions people make in terms of: Where do they work? How long do they work? When do they need to take time off? What reasons do they need to take time off?\n\n“Another big uncertainty is just how accessible immigration will be, especially in the next 10 years. That will play a big role in terms of how quickly the labor force will grow and how much we will be able to combat the aging population. Immigration tends to bring in young, prime working-age people. That level of uncertainty will be interesting to track going forward.”\n\nHere are some excerpts from Ladner’s comments during the September EN:Insights Forum.\n\nHow has the evolution of labor market conditions since 2020 shaped the balance of power between employers and job seekers?\n\nRight before the pandemic, the labor market was healthy and increasingly tight. There were a lot of job openings, unemployment was very low, and wage growth was strong. Then the pandemic hit, and we had a sudden wave of layoffs of nearly 20 million people, followed by a pretty quick recovery. As we entered 2021, we saw very rapid growth in job openings, which increased willingness for people to voluntarily quit and look for different employment opportunities.\n\nA lot of it had to do with the proliferation of remote work and people considering different dimensions of work that went beyond income. That persisted into 2022, and the labor market continued to be tight well into 2023. Job openings peaked at about 12.2 million in March 2022. Before the pandemic, the average was about 4.5 million. It was just hugely unprecedented.\n\nThroughout 2024, there’s been real tension around the idea that the labor market has been surprisingly resilient during this period of very high interest rates. We’ve gotten more clarity that the labor market has been loosening in the last couple months, with the gap between job openings and unemployment becoming considerably narrowed. At the beginning of the year, there were 2.6 million more job openings than there were unemployed people. Now it’s about half a million, but we still have a labor shortage.\n\nWhat sectors are struggling the most in terms of job shortages?\n\nHealth care is the No. 1 sector seeing shortages, and that’s been unsurprising for a lot of reasons. The pandemic era was extremely difficult for health care workers. It led to a lot of attrition and early retirements. Another issue is that demand for health care services is continually going up as the population ages, which is something that’s very likely to be an issue going well into the future. Construction is another sector that has been steadily growing. It’s a sector that goes through booms and busts, so we can’t really project what that’s going to look like in the future, but it’s a sector that’s looking quite strong as well.\n\nWe’ve seen some job losses in the manufacturing sector, particularly durable goods. Information technology has been weak as well.\n\nWhat effect have these conditions had on job security and wage growth?\n\nJob security has varied a lot during this period. In 2020, job security was a huge issue, particularly in sectors affected by forced closures, such as leisure and hospitality. This persisted into 2021. Meanwhile, government hiring has been quite consistent throughout this period, so job security there has been good. The Great Resignation was a great showcase of people feeling very confident in their jobs. As the Great Resignation ended in mid-2022 heading into 2023, it’s become more unstable for certain groups. Tech is a very high-profile example.\n\nWage growth was very strong in 2021 and 2022, and even though it’s cooled off quite a bit, still remains above average. In terms of worker perceptions, people in general felt negatively about their wages because inflation was so high during 2021 and 2022 that real wages actually fell. Wage growth is now outpacing inflation, but those lingering effects are influencing how people view their wages because there are still quite a few people that are now, in real terms, earning less than they did before the pandemic.\n\nHow have labor market conditions evolved in 2024?\n\nThe health of the labor market is a key indicator that the Federal Reserve has been closely tracking when considering potential interest rate cuts. (Editor’s Note: The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points on Sept. 18.) If wages are rising rapidly, cutting rates runs the risk of encouraging higher inflation, which the Fed has been working to curtail. But if you maintain high rates for a long period of time, that constrains investment so that companies aren’t growing as fast [and] hiring starts to fall off, and that leads to a poorer job market.\n\nIn just a few months, we’ve gone from a period of uncertainty to understanding that the labor market has definitely cooled down. It’s at least back to what it was like right before the pandemic, and unemployment is actually a little bit higher. There’s good evidence that the labor market’s loosened, and as a result, there are widespread expectations for several interest rate cuts going into next year.\n\nWhat key labor market trends do you foresee for 2025?\n\nOne thing that definitely will affect the labor market is the pace of those expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates can help a lot of sectors, especially where borrowing is important. In terms of the labor market, health care labor is going to continue to be strong. Manufacturing has seen employment shrink a little bit, and we’ll see if that’s a long-run trend or a short-term shock.\n\nThere are a lot of long-term trends that are going to be important in 2025. One of them is that for many, many decades, we’ve been going through a prolonged period of demographic change. A lot of this relates to the Baby Boomer generation. Baby Boomers were entering prime working age in the early 1970s and then began exiting it toward the turn of the century. So we had this big growth in the labor force between 1970 and 2000, followed by kind of a stall in the growth of the labor force as Baby Boomers were moving out of prime working age.\n\nGoing forward, there is this concern that the labor force will not be able to grow fast enough to meet demand for labor, so that will be another trend to look at in 2025. One thing that will be really important here is whether or not we are finally going to see a recovery in labor force participation among the oldest age groups.\n\nRegister for the next EN:Insights Forum.",

      "full_text": "When the turnover rate among hourly workers was rising at Sunstate Equipment in Phoenix, the company wanted to know why. In the past, Sameer Raut, SHRM-SCP, Sunstate’s vice president of HRIS, would have reached out to the data science team or created an analytics report himself for answers. Instead, he simply turned to a generative AI-driven chatbot and asked it a question in plain English: “What are the top reasons for hourly employee terminations in the past 12 months?” Within seconds, Raut had a detailed answer.\n\nSuch GenAI tools are transforming people analytics software that once required a high level of data literacy for CHROs to use. The fast-evolving technology is addressing a major pain point for HR executives. A 2023 study from Aptitude Research, for example, found that 39% of HR leaders cited limited expertise as their greatest challenge with people analytics.\n\nThe recent addition of large language models (LLMs) to popular analytics and business intelligence platforms has elevated the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of many systems to a new level. As a result, many of these analytics systems no longer require CHROs to phrase data queries in particular formats or use specific keywords to get accurate responses.\n\nFor example, a CHRO could ask a GenAI chatbot questions such as, “How does the software engineering team’s voluntary turnover compare to industry benchmarks?” and “What’s the trend of time-to-hire for business development specialists in Boston over the past two years?” The GenAI assistant would then quickly compile and retrieve that information from company datasets.\n\nHR technology analysts say that GenAI has also enhanced people analytics tools by automating previously manual processes in a way that creates more accurate and reliable HR data. The technology accomplishes that through improved data cleansing, data augmentation, and the efficient uniting of disparate HR data into one place.\n\nEasier Access to Key HR Data\n\nCommonly used analytics software providers such as Visier, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, and Sisense have all added some version of GenAI tools to their software. These tools are designed to improve the usability of their platforms and make it easier for HR executives to extract trends and insights from data related to metrics such as workforce costs, employee attrition, and recruiting performance.\n\n“We use our GenAI digital assistant to ask strategic questions like how our total workforce costs correlate with year-over-year headcount growth and to analyze headcount trends by department,” says Raut, referring to Visier’s GenAI tool Vee. “We also use Vee to analyze trends in terminations and track the number of open requisitions for our technicians, helping us identify potential gaps in our hiring needs.”\n\nPreviously, when he needed to access such data, Raut would have contacted his people analytics team, which could lead to delays. Or he might have undertaken the time-consuming process of building a report with multiple filters himself.\n\n“Now with Vee, I can just type in a request and receive an answer immediately,” Raut says. “The usability of the tool also makes it easier to get people data into the hands of those outside of HR, like senior leaders or front-line managers, so they can use the data to help drive their decision-making.”\n\nTo that end, experts say that GenAI is democratizing the use of people analytics in organizations, reducing the learning curve, and bringing those tools to a broader, non-HR audience by embedding them in commonly used platforms such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. This allows the data to reach line managers, for example, who might never log on to an analytics platform.\n\n“GenAI is lowering the barrier to entry for people analytics solutions,” says Lydia Wu, former senior director of people strategy and operations at Panasonic Energy of North America, who now works as the vice president of products for MeBeBot, a company that provides AI solutions to the HR market. “Historically, you would need a team of data scientists or researchers to generate the reports and findings you need. GenAI can enable CHROs to do more with fewer resources and create better analytics outcomes at the same time.”\n\nStacia Garr, co-founder and principal analyst of RedThread Research, an HR advisory and research firm in Woodside, Calif., says that while the NLP capabilities of some analytics platforms haven’t yet reached their potential, other vendors now have more advanced GenAI chatbots.\n\n“Some of the more sophisticated vendors have been working hard on improving their ability to handle complex data queries and are further ahead on that front than others,” Garr says. “But in general, the ability to create more nuanced, high-quality sentiment analysis with NLP exists and is making HR analytics more accessible to more people.”\n\nJeremy Shapiro, assistant vice president of HR and workforce analytics with the global health care company Merck, says he’s been using a GenAI tool in an analytics platform for about a year and believes CHROs are only at the beginning stage of their journeys with the technology.\n\n“Many of the tools out there now are proving helpful but aren’t necessarily essential yet,” Shapiro says. “But the trajectory of where GenAI is going is exciting. We are in Chapter 1 of a book that will be the length of a Stephen King novel.”\n\nRaut believes another key benefit of GenAI-driven chatbots is that they enable real-time insights during meetings and brainstorming sessions. “If someone in a meeting asks for some specific HR data, rather than saying, ‘Let me get back to you tomorrow,’ you can simply ask the GenAI assistant a question and get an answer right away,” he says. “That creates more productive and timely interactions.”\n\nTelling Better Data Stories to CEOs\n\nGenAI tools can also provide automated suggestions and tips that help CHROs and their teams create more visually compelling presentations—at a faster pace—for reporting analytics findings to CEOs or CFOs. Some tools, for example, can customize data visualizations, such as reports or dashboards, to audience preferences and create automated summaries of key data points.\n\n“A CHRO isn’t going to walk into a CEO’s office and say ‘Let me walk you through the science and statistical significance of our latest HR data,’ ” Wu says. “They’ll have maybe five minutes to lay out the problem and solution they found, ideally telling that data story in a graphically enticing way. Some GenAI tools can help put together persuasive data stories faster for CHROs and executive teams.”\n\nThe Data Security Question\n\nThe use of GenAI tools in analytics software doesn’t come without concerns for CHROs. Among the top fears is that using the still-embryonic technology will lead to the leaking of sensitive or proprietary company data.\n\n“I was just at a gathering of CHROs from startup firms as well as larger companies, and they all agreed the No. 1 risk of GenAI use is accidentally exposing sensitive data to the wrong people,” Shapiro says. “You have to be assured your data will be well-protected.”\n\nGuaranteeing that third-party analytics providers have an “entitlement management” model of data security is an important first step, Shapiro says. Such systems identify and closely control user access rights to sensitive information. Those access privileges, called “entitlements,” are typically based on employee roles and duties, as well as the company’s business needs.\n\nWu says it’s also important to understand how analytics providers train their LLMs. Visier, for example, avoids the risky process of training its model on customer data. Instead, it trains its LLM only on the universe of questions users ask Vee, its GenAI assistant. Those questions can sometimes be vague or context-dependent, and the LLM needs to be adept at translating them into specific data queries.\n\nExperts say the use of GenAI-infused chatbots like Vee on analytics platforms also largely avoids well-publicized problems such as hallucinations, inaccuracies, or copyright concerns because the LLMs don’t draw from public information on the internet but rather from an organization’s domain-specific people data.\n\n\n\nDave Zielinski is a business journalist based in Minneapolis and the lead technology writer for SHRM’s HR Quarterly.",

      "full_text": "This article was written by McKinsey & Company's Wendy Miller, Chief People Officer for North America and Bethany Rolan, Manager, People Strategy & Operations. For more insights, listen to the People + Strategy podcast episode featuring Miller.\n\n\n\nOver the past five years, we’ve really seen a revolution in how we work, thanks to digital tools, advanced analytics, and AI. These technologies have made our workspaces more flexible and collaborative, allowing us to adopt agile methods and use hybrid technologies that enhance our ability to work together across the globe.\n\nLeaders often assume teams will harness new technologies and advancements in productive ways, but unfortunately, without real intention and thoughtfulness, new ways to collaborate do not always translate to teams doing so effectively. Luckily, there are proven ways to cultivate teamwork by collecting data and converting it into actionable insights. Today, cultivating high-performing teams is not merely about collaboration; it is a disciplined science.\n\nWe’ve witnessed firsthand the transformative power data-driven insights can have to cultivate high-performing teams. At McKinsey, we created a continuous learning system using data science that taps into insights from the more than 4,000 teams we have deployed at any one time around the world. By analyzing how teams operate throughout a project and then surveying them post-project, we can evaluate what did—and didn’t—work, helping us continually improve our team rituals and tools.\n\nIt is this linkage of metrics to outcomes, both for individuals and teams, that is transforming the way we work.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation: Aligning Data Collection with Business Objectives\n\nCollecting data on a consistent basis is key for accurately measuring employee performance. At McKinsey, our goals are employee retention and exceptional client service ratings.\n\nTo track these metrics, we rely on the following:\n\nAnnual pulse surveys that gauge employee sentiment and spotlight emerging issues. Biweekly team surveys for ongoing insights into team dynamics and immediate feedback from client service teams. The Organizational Health Index to assess long-term health and forecast performance trends. Impact surveys we send to our clients to measure impact and experience.\n\nTip: Provide your team leaders real-time access to the data collected so they can determine what is and isn’t working, adjust, and efficiently enact change within their teams.\n\nReal-Time Example\n\nAs we navigated post-pandemic realities at McKinsey, our organization, like many, faced decisions about return-to-work policies. Instead of enforcing a blanket return to the office, we leaned on data and analytics to guide us. We conducted a comprehensive analysis involving thousands of team surveys and interviews. Then we selected specific teams to participate in experiments where we assigned them to various in person working schedules, such as alternating weekly between in person and remote work, two days in person, or four days in person. We then evaluated the performance of these teams based on critical outcomes including team effectiveness, client impact, and team satisfaction. We ultimately found that for our teams, there is a sweet spot for hybrid work: spending roughly 50% of the time working in person at a client site or in an office.\n\nThis data-driven approach to making organizational changes has yielded better outcomes for both our clients and teams. It’s led to better productivity and engagement, supported workforce sustainability, and boosted client impact. For example, our analysis showed that:\n\nColleagues who co-locate no more than 50% of the time are two times as likely to report having a more sustainable work-life balance. However, when teams co-locate more than 50% of the time, individuals’ satisfaction with their work-life balance starts to decline. Colleagues are 10 times more likely to feel that they are working well together when co-locating at least 50% of the time. Quality of mentorship increased by 25% for teams who spent some of their time in-person. Team, client, and individual outcomes increased significantly when colleagues spent at least 20% of their time in-person with their clients.\n\nHad we simply relied on pre-pandemic intuition, we might have reverted to a mandated four-day (80%) in-office week. Instead, our data-driven strategy allowed us to optimize our work model, enhancing our ability to deliver top-notch client service while attracting and retaining the best talent.\n\n\n\nPeople Analytics: Turning Data into an Operating System\n\nData collection is just the start. The real impact comes from the partnership between our people analytics team and our business leaders. Our analytics team sifts through multiple datasets, applies advanced analytics methods, and grasps the organizational context to extract meaningful insights. They then partner with our leadership team to determine actionable steps and identify how to effectively implement them throughout the organization.\n\nReal-Time Example\n\nTo foster a strong partnership between people analytics and our business leaders, we introduced an enterprisewide operating system known as the Way We Work (WWW). This system is built on several core principles and practices that foster effective collaboration and distinctive impact for both clients and internal teams. These rituals, used by all McKinsey teams, were developed in close partnership with our people analytics team. Through testing and learning, we’ve ensured these practices enhance team performance and experience across the board.\n\nToday, all managers and new hires are trained on the WWW guidelines, and middle managers track which teams actively use them. Through this process, the four WWW core best practices are:\n\nImplementing these practices led to significant improvements in both team and client satisfaction metrics, demonstrating the science of teamwork.\n\nThe formula involves adding the intuition that comes from experience to the insights deeply rooted in data. Remember: Even the most sophisticated data analytics won’t yield results alone. It is the employees who use the information to support their peers’ day-to-day workplace practices that create impact. Teamwork as a science is not just numbers; it’s a powerful tool that, when used correctly, transforms how teams operate and thrive.",

      "full_text": "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed lawsuits against 15 employers last week, alleging the companies have repeatedly failed to submit mandatory federal workforce demographic reports.\n\nThe companies—found across 10 states—include restaurants, retailers, and construction and logistics businesses. They have been charged with failing to submit mandatory EEO-1 data reports for 2021 and 2022. Federal law requires private employers with 100 or more employees and federal contractors with at least 50 employees to submit workforce data by job category and sex, race, or ethnicity to the EEOC. The workforce demographic data is used for a variety of purposes, including enforcement, analytics, and employer self-assessment.\n\n“This data collection is an important tool for ensuring compliance with Title VII’s prohibition on workplace discrimination,” said EEOC General Counsel Karla Gilbride. “Not only did Congress authorize the EEOC to collect this data, Congress also authorized the agency to go to court to obtain compliance when employers ignore their obligation to provide the required information.”\n\nEEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows added that the data help the agency focus its resources, identify potential discrimination, and refine its investigations.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that the employers still failed to comply even after the EEOC issued them a notice of noncompliance and a failure to file notification.\n\nThe EEOC is asking the courts to issue orders forcing the employers to file EEO-1 reports for the missing years and requiring them to do so in the future.\n\nThe annual data collection is authorized by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 2023 EEO-1 data collection is currently underway, and the deadline to file was June 4.\n\n“These lawsuits filed by the EEOC serve as a wake-up call to any employer that has not been meeting its reporting deadlines,” said Sheila Abron, a partner in the Columbia, S.C., office of Fisher Phillips.\n\n“While this requirement has been around for nearly six decades, some employers may have grown complacent, given the lack of actionable steps the EEOC may have taken in the past to enforce these rules,” Abron said. “With this flurry of lawsuits, however, you now have the clearest warning yet that compliance is essential.”",

      "full_text": "HR is at a crossroads of talent, smart technology and learning. It’s time for the industry to determine how to go forward, said Elliott Masie, learning and development innovator and Broadway producer, to attendees at the SHRM Talent Conference & Expo 2024 (Talent 2024), which is taking place now through April 17.\n\n“Crossroads means you have to prepare for breaking the rules, changing the functions and being surprised,” Masie said. “The world of learning is going to change. It’s going to change whether you are wanting it to change or not.\n\n“There are decisions that you and your company and your colleagues need to make [with artificial intelligence and smart tech] that ultimately will show it either as exciting or overwhelming as it comes right at you.\n\n“I’m here to push you a little bit. As you are here representing HR, you need to be confident and ready to be at the crossroads to advocate for sanity and good design when it comes to smart tech at your company.”\n\nMasie has been in the learning industry for 52 years. He is known as the person who, many years ago, coined the term “e-learning” for instruction delivered electronically over the internet.\n\nThe audience was challenged to think about what that “e” could stand for today. Among the answers offered were evolve, everywhere, everything, energize, entertain and evaluate. Understanding how the concept of “e” has changed, Masie said, will help HR professionals design and deliver e-learning today and tomorrow.\n\n“AI is not a standalone solution,” he said. “It becomes truly powerful when paired with human intelligence.”\n\nMasie urged HR professionals to have confidence and readiness at the crossroads to advocate for sanity and good design in using artificial intelligence.\n\nGenerative AI (GenAI) uses large language models that are fed prompts by information seekers. Not unlike the familiar search engines of the past generation, GenAI puts information at its users’ fingertips.\n\nMasie said he got a call from two of the largest school districts in the U.S. the week after ChatGPT was introduced, telling him they were banning the use of ChatGPT.\n\nTheir fear, Masie said, was that students were going to cheat on their exercises and homework.\n\nAfter he spoke at length with the school representatives about AI, they decided they weren’t going to be threatened by it.\n\nMasie said the conference attendees, as HR leaders, “have to decide: How do you balance all of that? How do you end up figuring it out? What do you approach? What do you test? What do you wait on? What do you look at as an example? How do you make sure that it works with your people along the way?”\n\nMasie offered some guidance to help with the AI journey, noting that AI’s four primary uses are optimization, automation, predictive analytics and personalization.\n\nOptimization, he said, means getting a better result. You can optimize, for example, the way an employee goes on maternity leave. There is an entire series of transactional information, policy and support for that person.\n\nAutomation can create “radical changes” in how things are done by using data to make predictions. He spoke of an odd situation during onboarding with a new company he knew of, where new hires were given a stack of forms to complete, including one about what happens when they retire from the company.\n\n“I will tell you: That company hasn’t had anybody retire yet, and by time they do, we’ll not be in an age where there are forms being filled out,” he said. “But how do we get data to really understand and predict when they will?”\n\nPersonalization, he said, is a key to learning. One common form is through on-the-job training.\n\n“What if we could truly personalize it based on that person’s background?” he asked. “What if we knew what they already know and what skills they are needing? If we could start the learning based on what they know and what they need to know and if we could personalize it, we could [improve their learning] by 100 percent to 200 percent.”\n\nPaul Bergeron is a freelance writer based in Virginia.",

      "full_text": "​In today's data-driven world, organizations rely heavily on comprehensive datasets to make informed decisions, drive innovation and gain a competitive edge. Data has become especially important for HR departments, where it can provide insights along the continuum of the employee life cycle, from hiring through termination or retirement. However, the unfortunate reality is that some departments—and the individuals within them—tend to \"hoard\" their data, leading to gaps in the company's data landscape that can result in flawed assumptions and poor decisions.\n\nData Is Buried Everywhere\n\nAs more organizations embark on \"digital transformation,\" one challenge they face is getting their arms around all the different data pools that may exist around the enterprise. Employees—and even managers and leaders—are often hesitant to give up control over \"their data,\" resulting in duplication of efforts, the potential for error, security risks and unnecessary costs.\n\nIn many organizations, data doesn't exist in a single repository. Instead, it tends to dwell in a multitude of small repositories that are owned and controlled by leaders and employees across the organization. The result is that data isn't interconnected or accessible to everyone.\n\nThe same issue exists within divisions and departments. Take HR, for example. HR data likely lives within the HR domain but may also reside within finance (e.g., employee payroll); learning and development (training information—e.g., courses completed, completion dates and success rates); risk management and compliance (e.g., licensures and sanctions); and on and on. In addition, supervisors and managers may maintain their own employee data in their own files, such as performance review information and disciplinary actions and documentation.\n\nData that is not connected across the organization is subject not only to duplication, but also to inaccuracies. And in the case of employee documentation, there are also potential legal and regulatory risks. This all has important practical implications for HR in ensuring that data is accessible, accurate and integrated.\n\nA Case in Point\n\nJohn Peebles is CEO at Administrate, a training management software firm based in Edinburgh, Scotland. He shared an example from one of Administrate's clients, a renowned boat manufacturer that was facing employee retention challenges with new hires. \"We found that their training technology did not integrate with the company's other departments and business functions. This meant its decision-makers could not see why so many new hires left during or shortly after their training,\" Peebles said.\n\n\"Moving the company's training data to a digital format and then applying learning analytics to study it—and then integrating this data with other functions at the company—revealed shortfalls and gaps in their training program,\" he continued. \"When these were addressed, they achieved a remarkable reduction in employee turnover, plummeting from 50 to 60 percent to an astonishing five to 10 percent.\"\n\nWhile these and other process improvements can be made based on insights gleaned from relevant data, getting people to \"let go\" of their data—or even to share it—can be problematic.\n\nWhy We Hoard\n\n\"Information is power.\" It's an old saying, but one that is particularly apt here. There is a natural tendency for employees who generate or acquire information to want to keep it close to the vest.\n\n\"Data hoarding within organizations can be attributed to a combination of cultural, operational and psychological factors,\" said Jon Morgan, CEO and editor-in-chief of Venture Smarter, a consulting firm in San Francisco. \"When departments view data as a source of power or control, they are less inclined to share it with others, fearing that it might diminish their influence.\"\n\nOperational inefficiencies can also lead to data hoarding. \"If access to data is cumbersome or time-consuming, employees may be less motivated to share it, preferring to keep it close for their own convenience,\" Morgan said. In addition, \"psychological factors like fear of criticism or a desire to protect one's domain can also drive data hoarding.\" Employees may worry that sharing data will expose their mistakes or weaknesses, leading to a reluctance to collaborate, he said.\n\nJace McLean, senior director of strategic architecture at Domo, a data platform based in American Fork, Utah, said he believes that cultural factors are the most important lever to use in changing data-hoarding habits. \"Creating the proper culture will autocorrect the operational and psychological factors,\" he said. \"I haven't seen an organization specifically create a culture where the policy is to hoard data, but oftentimes the lack of a culture promoting openness and collaboration allows those psychological and operational issues to thrive.\"\n\nEffective communication is a critical part of building a culture that encourages data sharing and overcomes hoarding tendencies. Employees need to understand why they should share data, who to share it with and how sharing will benefit the organization as a whole. But in addition to understanding the why of data sharing, they often need to understand the how.\n\nBreaking Down Barriers Through Communication and Collaboration\n\n\"A robust policy that properly communicates the intent of an open data culture requires buy-in from many different areas of the organization,\" McLean said. \"This will generally require input from those areas. Bringing together producers and consumers of data, and the resulting content, should start the process from a place of trust and lead to the type of culture that leads to data sharing.\"\n\nVenture Smarter has used several strategies to encourage data sharing, Morgan said. For example, a companywide data-sharing platform centralizes data storage and access to streamline the process and foster a sense of transparency and accountability. In addition, the company has \"incentivized data sharing through performance metrics that reward collaboration and knowledge sharing,\" he said. That has led to improved data sharing and more informed decision-making.\n\nFrom a process standpoint, Venture Smarter has focused on \"defining clear data ownership and access rights,\" Morgan said. \"Regular audits and compliance checks help maintain data security, while data stewardship roles ensure responsible data handling. This framework strikes a balance between openness and protection.\"\n\nMcLean agreed that a proper framework is essential. \"Establishing a data governance model is the first step in promoting an open and collaborative data culture,\" he said. \"Without one, employees often wonder if they are allowed to bring data together and simply don't. By building a framework, it communicates to employees that as long as they stay within these guardrails, they are free to explore and ideate.\"\n\nEffective communication can help critical department heads, managers and supervisors understand why HR data should be unified and accessible and how they can help make this happen. HR leaders can, and should, be proactive in this process.\n\n\"Transparent communication plays a crucial role in addressing data hoarding. We emphasize the importance of data as a collective asset and its impact on the organization's success,\" Morgan said. \"Encouraging a culture of data sharing and collaboration requires leadership to lead by example and recognize and reward those who contribute to the collective data pool.\"\n\nLin Grensing-Pophal is a freelance writer in Chippewa Falls, Wis.",

      "full_text": "If improving employee engagement and retention is at the top of your HR priority list, consider working with managers to change the idea that every employee-manager meeting should be about performance.\n\nMost meetings are typically about performance, rather than engaging or retaining your employee. Think about it: Almost every type of manager-employee meeting is a one-way street. We have many names for these meetings, including project updates, status checks, performance reviews and specialized meetings for teams. It seems every meeting is about \"Did you do your work?\" or \"Here's more work.\"\n\nSome managers sprinkle niceties at the beginning or the end: \"How are you doing?\" \"What's happening?\" \"Everything going OK for you?\" And performance reviews might also include some form of mandatory career questions at the end, such as, \"What do you like most about your role?\"\n\nShift the Conversation to Engagement and Retention\n\nManagers should actually schedule some of these one-way meetings in the opposite direction, in which the employees talk about their needs and managers listen. We know these meetings as stay interviews. A stay interview is a structured, one-on-one meeting between a leader and an employee to strengthen the employee's engagement and retention.\n\nAfter years of helping organizations implement stay interviews, we understand why they bring magic. Yet, it's easy to forget most employees' initial emotional reaction to being asked to participate in one. Their reaction, of course, is clouded by how much employees trust their managers. So, the answer is either: \"Yes! I'd love to have that meeting\" or \"Uh, sure, we can meet, let's see.\" A simple, effective introduction is: \"I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to learn what I can do to make working here better for you.\"\n\nSolid data tells us these facts:\n\nResearch has pinpointed the dollar value of having an engaged team. According to Gallup surveys, companies with high numbers of engaged employees have 48 percent fewer safety incidents, 41 percent fewer quality defects, 37 percent less absenteeism and are 21 percent more profitable overall.\n\nStay Interviews Build Trust\n\nIn a stay interview, if employees want more recognition or communication, they'll tell you. Or they'll tell you if they want more training, specific coaching or to work more with a certain peer. They'll also tell you which equipment works better than others and which colleagues disappoint them with shoddy work.\n\nBy asking, listening, probing and taking notes, managers can then work with employees on the spot to identify actions to actually make their work better. These are the parts of work that matter most to most of us, the ones employees talk about over dinner each night.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There are times and places for performance-based meetings. But to improve engagement and retention, stay interviews work because they build trust.\n\n5 Questions Are All You Need\n\nMy company has determined after much practice and research that managers need just five questions to make stay interviews effective. When you follow up by asking strong probing questions, you will get all the information you need to develop individualized engagement and retention plans that really work.\n\nAs you read the questions, apply a few essential skills:\n\nListen 80 percent of the time.  Probe to learn more and to show you care.Take notes to capture key points, emotional words and important quotes.\n\nHere are the five essential questions for stay interviews and why they work:\n\n\n\nQUESTION 1: What do you look forward to each day when you go to work?\n\nThis question causes employees to focus on their daily duties and challenges rather than expand on broader issues like pay and benefits. Employees stay and engage based on their relationships with supervisors and colleagues and how much they like what they do. Effective probes include:\n\n\"Give me an example.\"\"Tell me more about …\"\"Who do you look forward to working with the most?\"\n\n\n\nQUESTION 2. What are you learning here, and what do you want to learn?\n\n\"Learning\" in the present tense sends the compelling message that you want your employees to grow and to prosper for both themselves and the organization. When answering, employees will hear their own lists, so they know they are developing and not standing still. When we train managers to conduct stay interviews, we teach them that career discussions are built around the word \"skills.\" So, probes might include:\n\n\"Which skills would you like to build?\" \"Which skills do you think are required for that position?\"\n\n\n\nQUESTION 3. Why do you stay here?\n\nWhile appearing simple at first, this question can open major doors for discovery. The goal is for employees to dig deeply to identify and then announce why they stay. The initial response might be superficial, such as, \"I have to pay the bills.\" But trained managers can respond by saying, \"Me too, but why do you stay here?\"\n\nRefrain from giving hints, and instead say, \"Take a few moments. I really want to learn why you stay.\" Other possible probes include:\n\n\"Tell me more about why that is so important to you.\"\"Is that the only reason you stay or are there others?\"\"If you narrowed your reasons to stay to just one, what would it be?\"\n\nUltimately, employees will remember their reasons once they discover them within themselves and announce those reasons to their manager. These types of exchanges drive up trust, improve employee output and engagement, and ultimately improve employee retention.\n\n\n\nQUESTION 4. When was the last time you thought about leaving our team? What prompted it?\n\nEveryone thinks about leaving sometimes, so a directly worded question brings a much-needed conversation into the light. The question rises above all subtleties and gets to the core retention issue. The \"when\" tells us the urgency, and \"what prompted it\" tells us why. Possible probes are many. Here are three:\n\n\"How important is that issue now to you on a 1-10 scale?\"\"What's the single most important thing I can do to make it better?\"\"Can I count on you to come directly to me if you ever feel that way again?\"\n\n\n\nQUESTION 5. What can I do to make your experience at work better for you?\n\nThis question begs for feedback on the manager's style. So, all who ask it should prepare to avoid being defensive. More importantly, answers provide clues regarding how each manager should adapt their style to each employee. Probes might include:\n\n\"Do I tell you when you do something well or only when you do something ineffectively?\"\"How do you like to be recognized?\"\"What are three ways I can be a better manager for you?\"\n\nEmployees will not likely remember these questions when they speak to their peers or go in for another stay interview, so there is little reason to reword them each time. Asking them consistently also sharpens your managers' skills to where questioning and probing becomes routine.\n\n\n\nDick Finnegan is CEO of C-Suite Analytics and is the author of the popular book The Power of Stay Interviews for Engagement and Retention.

      "full_text": "​The volume of employee requests to HR help desks continues to grow, fueled by hybrid work policies, new benefits offerings, expectant parents' questions about leave policies and stressed-out employees' queries about paid time off.\n\nTo handle employee questions in a more efficient and timely manner, many larger enterprises are investing in integrated HR service management systems, which include employee portals, knowledge management software and case management systems. The idea behind these tiered systems is to deploy self-service tools and chatbots to handle basic employee questions while escalating more complex issues or ones with a legal or compliance component to experienced HR specialists.\n\nHR service management systems represent an upgrade over traditional intranets and can reduce the number of incoming calls and e-mails to overburdened HR help desks. Many smaller and midsize organizations are also experiencing higher volumes of service requests but have yet to invest in these systems. SHRM Online spoke with HR analysts and leaders about which criteria to use in choosing vendor systems and how to maximize the return on investment of these platforms.\n\nHow to Evaluate Vendor Offerings\n\nWhen choosing an integrated service delivery solution, experts suggest comparing what's available in your existing HR technology ecosystem with systems available from standalone or \"point solution\" providers.\n\nIn some cases, a core human capital management (HCM) system will have an embedded service management solution. The 2022-2023 HR Systems Survey from Sapient Insights Group found that 37 percent of respondents use their core HCM system as an employee portal, 27 percent use it for content management and 23 percent use it as an employee help desk.\n\nA growing number of standalone systems are tailored specifically for HR service delivery environments, with a handful employing consumer-grade technology. Examples include Dovetail, Zendesk and Atlassian's Jira.\n\nStacey Harris, chief research officer and managing partner of Sapient, said HR buyers should evaluate prospective solutions based on how well they can be tailored for unique HR service scenarios, the quality of reporting and analytics tools, the user-friendliness of knowledge bases and the modern functions available in case management tools.\n\nHarris said one of the biggest benefits of these systems is the data they generate. For example, with good analytics and reporting, HR can see which articles in an internal knowledge base are getting the most traffic, what documents or forms are downloaded most often and how quickly service requests are being resolved.\n\n\"The reporting and analytics give HR leaders insight into the most common questions being asked or emerging problems in the organization,\" she said. \"For example, during the pandemic, we saw a lot of organizations using calls to their HR help desks to pinpoint COVID-19 hot spots in the company.\"\n\nWhen evaluating standalone solutions, HR leaders also need to consider integration issues, Harris said. \"There can be a lot of integration points you need to build out, and if your IT group isn't bought into doing those integrations, it can present challenges,\" she noted.\n\nMaking the Most of Product Demos\n\nExperts say it's important to put vendors' systems through the proper paces in product demonstrations. Start by being crystal-clear on your service delivery goals and most important use cases.\n\n\"Identify your highest-value and your most challenging use cases for each service tier of an integrated system and ensure the vendor addresses those in its demo,\" said Kimberly Carroll, managing principal with IA, an HR advisory and research firm in Atlanta.\n\nIt's also important to have employees who'll actually be using an HR service system test it during a demo or sandbox arrangement, said Ben Eubanks, chief research officer at Lighthouse Research and Advisory, an HR consulting and research firm in Huntsville, Ala.\n\n\"Have a few employees create tickets and do a pilot test of how the knowledge management or case management system works,\" Eubanks said. \"Is the system user-friendly, are there any roadblocks and how long does it take your people to find the right information or receive answers?\"\n\nHarris said product demos often impress HR buyers, but they may not reflect reality. \"Most demos are done in a clean environment, meaning they don't factor in in how your particular HR function is structured or its unique service challenges,\" she said. \"Instead of just one policy in a category, HR might have multiple nuanced policies, for example.\"\n\nHarris also recommended doing a thorough evaluation of the chatbots vendors might use to answer employee questions or aid in knowledge base searches. \"Ask the provider how much training those chatbots will require for your unique environment, how much you can update them and what kind of maintenance they'll require,\" she said.\n\nGood self-service functionality in an employee portal can significantly reduce inbound calls or e-mails to HR help desks, experts say. On his podcast \"We're Only Human,\" Eubanks interviewed Nicole Sloane, an employee experience leader with Kimberly-Clark, about how her team implemented a new global HR service delivery system to help simplify and enhance employee service. The system features a knowledge base with 5,000 articles, a chatbot and experienced HR specialists to help with more complex, unique or sensitive cases.\n\nIn 2021, Kimberly-Clark employees asked 27,000 questions of the chatbot and completed about 16,000 transactions using the integrated service system, which can accommodate 18 languages. Sloane said her team used a \"system agnostic\" chatbot from vendor Socrates.ai to create more rapid, personalized interactions for employee service requests.\n\nEvaluating Knowledge Management Tools\n\nA key component of integrated HR service management systems is knowledge bases that contain articles answering a wide range of employees' HR-related questions. But not all knowledge bases are created equal.\n\nThe best ones are easily searchable and result in fewer employee questions or issues escalated to higher service tiers because the knowledge base answers the majority of worker questions on its own.\n\nTop knowledge management tools automatically index uploaded content for employee search, meaning HR doesn't have to manually tag content. In addition, they tie content to employee profiles so workers only see the content they should, and they have intuitive search features, often employing chatbots to assist employees in locating just the right article or attachment.\n\n\"If you're looking for information about a leave policy, for example, and a search of a knowledge base brings back a list of 25 links to possible answers, why in the world would anyone ever use that?\" Eubanks said. \"If the user experience is awful and it takes forever to get answers, you've defeated the purpose of using a knowledge base.\"\n\nAssessing Case Management Functionality\n\nCase management tools allow HR to create a more efficient, centralized way of addressing employees' more complex service requests. Workers with questions or concerns file a ticket that's automatically routed to the right HR service specialist to address. Use of these tools means HR no longer has to rely on shared e-mail inboxes or spreadsheets, which can lead to lost cases or delayed service to employees.\n\nExperts say the best case management tools include intuitive knowledge search features for HR service agents; the ability to add phone or e-mail interactions with employees to case histories; templates with preworded e-mails for frequently asked questions; good audit trail features; and the ability to automatically escalate cases to specific HR experts when needed.\n\nGretchen Alarcon, vice president and general manager with vendor ServiceNow, said artificial intelligence (AI) plays a growing role in deciding whether to escalate employee cases to HR specialists.\n\n\"Based on the words an employee uses when filing a case, AI can determine that the request might need to skip a service tier and go directly to [an] HR center of excellence responsible for things like employee relations or leave management,\" she explained.\n\nCase management systems also should ensure data security and employee confidentiality, Alarcon said.\n\n\"An issue might come in through a case filed by an employee that turns out to be a very sensitive employee relations matter,\" she said. \"You want to ensure there's good security in place so only the people with the right to access that information can see it. You need to protect the confidentiality of involved parties in the case of an investigation.\"\n\nNext-generation case management systems also have tools that automate and enforce service-level agreements, ensuring that HR prioritizes the most important or urgent cases from among the large volume of cases it typically receives.\n\n\"HR departments have a lot on their plates,\" Eubanks said. \"Systems that allow them to easily prioritize incoming requests are very valuable, enabling them to work on the most important things first. That might be a legal issue, a compliance matter or a collective bargaining issue with a union.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is principal of Skiwood Communications, a business writing and editing company in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​The myriad challenges faced by businesses over the past few years have shined a new spotlight on people analytics.\n\nThe C-suite is paying more attention to how talent shortages impact the bottom line; how factors such as compensation, training opportunities and remote work affect employee retention; and how diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) initiatives influence the corporate brand.\n\nThis new focus has translated into a growing thirst for people analytics to give senior leaders and non-HR managers improved data to make challenging people decisions. As a result, more HR functions are using next-generation analytics technologies that can integrate disparate HR data and quickly put actionable insights into the hands of leaders to help them make better-informed decisions.\n\nA recent McKinsey & Co. survey of senior leaders including CHROs found more of them are increasing their investments in advanced analytics tools. Almost three-quarters of CHROs expect to nearly double the number of different applications they use for analytical techniques in the next 12 months, according to the survey.\n\nMeanwhile, Sapient Insight Group's 2022-2023 HR Systems Survey found that for midsize and large companies, HR analytics will be a top target for investment in the coming year, second only to recruiting technology investments.\n\nIncreased interest in analytics also is reflected in the growing size of people analytics teams. According to the 2022 People Analytics Trends study from Insight222, an HR research and advisory firm in London, 65 percent of surveyed companies said they increased the size of their people analytics team in the previous year. In addition, LinkedIn's 2023 Jobs on the Rise report ranked people analytics managers as the second-fastest-growing job in the U.S.\n\n\"The data shows that investment in the people analytics discipline was not just because of the pandemic, but a strategic business decision that is expected to continue,\" wrote the authors of the Insight222 study. \"Our research shows there is clear intention and action of CHROs in building a data-driven culture in HR and delivering value to the business by leveraging expertise and skills that people analytics bring.\"\n\nWhat the Best Do Differently\n\nOrganizations that successfully use people analytics to improve leadership decision-making do things differently than others, experts say. SHRM Online spoke with people analytics experts and HR practitioners to identify practices and technology investments that help separate the best from the rest.\n\nBest-practice organizations use analytics, not guesswork, to measure the success of key initiatives. Best-practice companies don't rely on assumptions or gut feel to determine whether key HR initiatives are paying dividends—they use proven analytics tools to measure success and return on investment.\n\nStacia Garr, co-founder and principal analyst with RedThread Research, an HR research and advisory firm in Woodside, Calif., said her organization conducted research last year looking at companies that had used stay bonuses as a means of improving employee retention. Under those plans, new employees who stayed with an organization for one year to 18 months received a significant bonus.\n\n\"What analytics in those organizations found is that stay bonuses didn't meaningfully impact retention, yet the company was pouring millions of dollars into them,\" Garr said. \"Data showed they needed to stop providing bonuses and start using other means to stem attrition.\"\n\nLydia Wu, director of HR strategy and technology for Panasonic North America, said her analytics team surveyed employees when her organization was considering bringing workers back to the office as the pandemic began to wane. Those surveys were conducted against the backdrop of ongoing DE&I initiatives in the company.\n\n\"With that DEI lens in mind, we discovered through surveys that we were about to lose one-third of our female population as a result of requiring a return to the office,\" Wu said. \"The data convinced our leaders to delay the return-to-work conversation at that time.\"\n\nExemplars \"democratize\" people analytics for use across the organization, not just in HR. Best-practice organizations use technologies to get people data into the hands of non-HR leaders to help them make decisions, understanding that such analytics need to travel outside of HR for maximum impact.\n\n\"That's important because it creates a 'pull' effect on HR when more business leaders start seeing people data and asking more questions about it,\" said Dirk Petersen, a managing director with Insight222. \"It leads to more sharing of people analytics outside of HR.\"\n\nGarr said more technology vendors are building or adapting their platforms with non-HR users in mind, noting that even more improvement is needed in that area.\n\n\"We're seeing more analytics vendors wake up to the importance of viewing senior leaders and line managers as full-fledged users of their systems for whom they need to design features and functions,\" she said.\n\nWu said partnering with analytics vendors that can make people data understandable and actionable for non-technical users is increasingly important.\n\n\"Vendors need to understand that not everyone who works in HR or needs access to HR data is a data scientist or is data-savvy,\" she said. \"You want a platform that can translate people data into understandable insights and make recommendations for your end-user audience, which also takes some of the analytics workload off of HR.\"\n\nBest-practice organizations use platforms that can easily integrate HR data with other internal and external data. Experts say the ability to collect and integrate data from multiple HR systems, as well as other internal or external platforms, leads to improved people decisions.\n\nRedThread's 2022 study found that almost 50 percent of vendors now integrate existing employee data with other internal and external data, and many also have designed integrations—with a growing number using application programming interfaces—to connect data from HRISs to other talent platforms.\n\nThese platforms can pull information including sales, CRM and learning data together with external data, such as labor market information, to help guide leadership decisions. RedThread's research found that effectively using integrated people analytics data \"can impact businesses in terms of millions of dollars,\" wrote the survey's authors.\n\n\"More HR leaders are seeing the power of bringing data together to produce contextual insights,\" Garr said. \"They're also requiring technology vendors to make people data more portable so they can analyze it through tools like multi-source analysis platforms.\"\n\nThose platforms integrate and analyze data from different operational systems and distribute insights with appropriate levels of security throughout an organization, Garr said. Examples of vendors with multi-source analysis platforms include Visier, One Model and Crunchr.\n\nBest-practice organizations use analytics to break down barriers between HR and finance.\n\nLeading HR functions build bridges with finance on the use of people analytics. \"The idea is to help finance understand our view of the world regarding analytics and vice versa,\" Wu said. \"For example, helping finance understand that a job vacancy doesn't just translate to cost savings and will impact company performance in other ways in the long run.\"\n\nSuch partnerships also allow finance to educate HR on how it measures success, Wu said. \"That helps us translate HR outcomes into numbers that make sense to finance, allowing us to structure our HR data in a way that's understandable and meaningful to them,\" she said.\n\nBest-practice organizations use a host of dashboards to monitor key people metrics.\n\nBest-practice employers use a wide variety of user-friendly dashboards to track key metrics. These dashboards often monitor headcount, total cost of workforce, voluntary employee turnover, source of hire, failed hires, DE&I metrics and time since last promotion/pay raise, among other measures.\n\nDashboards are often used in recruiting, where organizations continue to face talent shortages and challenges in filling open roles. Amy Wood, former senior director of recruiting operations for vendor Gem, said more recruiters are leaving behind traditional tools such as spreadsheets in favor of more sophisticated technologies that bring new efficiencies to tracking key recruiting metrics.\n\nDashboards can produce insights such as a need to rework job descriptions, pinpoint bottlenecks in talent pipelines or quickly identify hiring sources that aren't performing up to expectations. For example, dashboards might show that candidates from diverse backgrounds or underrepresented groups are dropping out of the hiring process at disproportionate rates before making it to the interviewing stage.\n\n\"You want your recruiting team spending more time in the funnel talking to candidates and less time doing manual data entry or struggling to conduct data analysis,\" Wood said. \"More sophisticated technologies can automate the data gathering and analysis process and give recruiters far more time with applicants.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is principal of Skiwood Communications, a business writing and editing company in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​Human resource technology moved from backstage to center stage in 2021. Venture capital investment in HR platforms and applications hit record levels, the C-suite green lit spending on a wealth of technologies designed to support remote and hybrid work, and industry vendors responded to HR's pandemic-driven needs by developing innovative new features on their platforms.\n\nWhile spending likely won't continue at the same torrid pace in 2022, industry analysts expect many of this year's trends to continue or accelerate as technology becomes a key solution to slowing labor shortages and employee resignations, facilitating hybrid work, and managing COVID-19 in the workplace.\n\nSupporting Hybrid Work, Deskless Workers and Employee Listening\n\nAnalysts say organizations will continue to invest in technologies that help employees toggle between working at home and in the office; pay more attention to the technology needs of deskless workers; and keep making broad use of tools that capture employee feedback.\n\n\"I expect investment in remote-enabling tools to continue in 2022, and we'll also see even more policy transition to hybrid-work models and software that supports that shift,\" said Joe Du Bey, CEO of New York-based Eden Workplace, a company that provides software to manage hybrid workforces.\n\nSome analysts believe employee listening platforms will continue to be as critical in 2022 as they were earlier in the pandemic, albeit for different reasons.\n\n\"As organizations return their workers to the office—many of whom will have never met their colleagues face-to-face before—they'll continue to value insights into how employees are doing and what adjustments need to be made,\" said Stacia Garr, principal analyst of RedThread Research, an HR research, advisory and membership firm in Woodside, Calif. \"But organizations won't just rely on employee surveys next year. They'll also increase their use of more objective data, such as digital communications, to give them real-time insights into employee sentiment.\"\n\nThe technology needs of deskless workers also will be in the spotlight next year, according to analyst Josh Bersin, dean of the Josh Bersin Academy in Oakland, Calif. Deskless employees in retail, transportation, hospitality, health care and manufacturing make up 80 percent of the global workforce, and those workers often don't have access to the collaboration and communication platforms, support systems and services available to deskbound knowledge workers, Bersin said.\n\n\"A shocking 84 percent of deskless workers feel like they don't get adequate communication from their employers,\" Bersin wrote in a recent report. \"Winning the war for talent will depend on the deskless worker experience you offer.\"\n\nBersin said more vendors are offering mobile-first and customizable approaches to help deskless employees engage with their organizations. He cited platforms like Social Chorus as examples of how to keep deskless workers connected to company news, up-to-date on training needs and engaged with their co-workers via an app.\n\nCareer-Oriented Technology Takes Flight\n\nHR analysts say organizations are more focused than ever on understanding which skills their workforces possess. Employees also are hungry for more learning and development.\n\n\"As a result, we expect to continue to see a massive focus on career technology,\" Garr said. \"That will include technology that focuses on understanding internal mobility within organizations, on internal talent marketplaces, and on coaching and mentoring tech to connect people with experts that can help them learn and grow.\"\n\nAI Spread Its Wings, but Scrutiny Grows\n\nArtificial intelligence will continue to evolve and be deployed by vendors beyond its more common uses in recruiting, learning and employee sentiment analysis, analysts say. But vendors' use of AI for employment decisions also will face increased scrutiny from government regulators and HR practitioners.\n\n\"AI will be embedded into more core [human capital management] platforms and applications, and the barriers to buying or building AI will be reduced thanks to commoditization of the technology and more low-code or no-code development options,\" said John Brownridge, digital workplace leader for Deloitte Consulting.\n\nPaul Rubenstein, chief people officer for Visier, a provider of people analytics software in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, believes AI will increasingly be used by organizations to help guide busy managers in where best to focus their limited time. \"Just like companies use algorithms to help focus on 'who is likely to buy' or 'which customers might be at risk,' line managers will get more help from AI on knowing where they should put time and attention into teams and individuals,\" Rubenstein said.\n\nStacey Harris, chief research officer and managing partner of the Sapient Insights Group in Atlanta, said vendors will continue to innovate in areas where HR buyers have the strongest interest—recruiting, skills management and predictive capabilities.\n\n\"I think some of the hotter new HR technology capabilities we'll see emerge next year will be in virtual training, workforce planning and forecasting tools, technologies that measure belonging and culture, and also tools that better connect the dots between compensation and productivity and work outcomes,\" Harris said.\n\nBetsy Summers, principal analyst in the future of work for Forrester, said vendors will face more scrutiny in 2022 to demonstrate the value their AI tools deliver to HR users.\n\n\"We see HR tech vendors investing a lot in AI while HR's confidence in AI still remains low,\" Summers said. \"That signals a need for vendors to present AI in a transparent and explainable fashion for users so they can trust vendors' algorithms to deliver sound and ethical recommendations.\"\n\nRecruiting: Continued Momentum for Virtual Tools, Consolidated Platforms\n\nRecruiters will continue to rely on the virtual sourcing, interviewing and onboarding tools they were forced to turn to during the pandemic.\n\nInvesting in recruiting technology next year ranked as the top priority for respondents to Sapient Insight Group's 2021-2022 HR Systems Survey, tied with plans to spend more on learning-related technologies. Given continued labor shortages, recruiters will be focused on using technologies not just to identify talent that applies to a posted job but also to source and cultivate from research and discovery, experts say.\n\n\"We'll continue to see investments in innovation for talent acquisition systems from a point solution perspective as well as consolidation of solutions into larger, platform-based models,\" said Elaine Orler, senior vice president of technology consulting for the Talent Function, a Cielo company.\n\nCathy Gao, a partner with Sapphire Ventures, a venture capital firm specializing in technology companies, believes use of platforms that allow recruiters to source, screen and interview candidates virtually at scale will continue at a high rate.\n\n\"While the past 21 months likely represent a peak in technology adoption, the benefits of a virtual-first approach transcend the pandemic,\" Gao said. \"Virtual processes often shorten hiring cycles and also produce rich data from which companies can draw insights into their recruiting workflows.\"\n\nEric Sydell, executive vice president of innovation for Modern Hire, a talent acquisition technology provider in Delafield, Wis., said the candidate experience will continue to be a high priority for recruiters next year as applicants field multiple offers. \"It will remain a candidates' market, and hiring teams must adapt or risk losing the daily fight for talent,\" Sydell said. \"Hiring will increasingly be defined by virtual tools and data-driven techniques that create new paths to continuous process improvement.\"\n\nRecruiters also will rely more on sourcing technologies to help identify nontraditional or \"hidden\" talent as the labor shortage continues. \"Many companies are struggling to find talent and as a result are using foreign nationals as talent pools,\" said Kira Meinzer, chief people officer for Envoy Global, an immigration services provider in Chicago that helps companies hire international workers. \"Technology can help manage the visa process more efficiently.\"\n\nOrler also believes more recruiting vendors will expand their platform capabilities to include procuring \"total talent,\" or recruiting contract and contingent workers rather than just full-time employees. \"That type of innovation creates the ability for organizations to meet candidates where they are regarding their work preferences without having to delay efforts by using multiple technology systems,\" Orler said.\n\nPeople Analytics: Growing Demand for Real-Time Data, Use Beyond HR\n\nThe increased demand for timely people analytics by the C-suite and HR leaders last year will accelerate in 2022, experts say, as leaders seek more metrics that can provide real-time data on talent supplies, market compensation trends, employee attrition and workforce vaccination rates.\n\nRubenstein believes 2022 is the year that use of people analytics takes root outside of HR functions.\n\n\"Front-line managers need to make operational and financial decisions with a more holistic set of data about people,\" Rubenstein said. \"Salary and tenure data are no longer enough. Managers need to see data about employee skills, exit risk and ease of replacement at their fingertips. It's no longer a world of financial decisions with people only as an afterthought.\"\n\nRecruitment leaders and hiring managers also will seek more current data in areas like compensation benchmarks and talent supply in different geographies. \"Market data is moving faster than the old 'annual survey' results that come from most providers,\" Rubenstein said. \"Look for companies with big sets of real-time data to offer benchmarks and insights that are fresher and more credible.\"\n\nDan Staley, global HR technology leader for PwC, believes the continuing adoption of cloud technologies by HR functions in 2022 will bode well for analytics initiatives.\n\n\"Many HR leaders have long struggled to gather, share and analyze data efficiently,\" Staley said. \"Cloud solutions enable data collection and analysis in formats that can be readily accessed and shared across an entire organization, allowing CHROs to make analytics-driven decisions, run what-if scenarios and pivot quickly with ongoing workforce shifts.\"\n\nNew Vendor Capabilities in Vaccination Tracking, COVID-19 Testing\n\nTechnology vendors will continue to add new capabilities to tools that help HR track employees' vaccination status, booster shots and COVID-19 test results. Many large HR technology vendors offer such tracking tools as do smaller providers including ReturnSafe, ID.me and Alight Verify.\n\nServiceNow, for example, recently partnered with the Commons Project to help organizations improve the process of verifying vaccination of employees, a step which remains manual in many companies.\n\nTechnology Drives Deeper Understanding of DE&I\n\nOrganizations will continue to invest in tools and analytics that can help them take the next step in assessing the progress of their diversity, equity and inclusion (DE& I) initiatives. \"We've seen a remarkable increase in interest in DE&I analytics in 2021 as organizations try to get a better and more nuanced understanding of the current state of diversity in their organizations and what they can do to drive change through inclusion,\" said Garr of RedThread Research.\n\nWhile much of the focus around DE&I analytics in the past has been on talent acquisition, Garr expects a greater emphasis on other internal practices in 2022.\n\n\"That includes analysis of performance reviews and feedback, as well as understanding biases that may exist in succession or promotion processes or peer-to-peer recognition,\" Garr said. \"While organizations are making progress in hiring more diverse populations, more are recognizing that they cannot retain those people if they don't change their internal practices and cultures.\"\n\nVendors Invest Heavily in Unified User Experience\n\nVendors will continue to invest in creating one-stop-shop, user-centric HR platforms to help organizations deal with converging challenges of remote work, fragmented technology infrastructures and poor user experiences.\n\n\"Companies today must make it easy for employees to get their work done from wherever and whenever they are with minimal technical support or learning required,\" said Deloitte's Brownridge. \"As a result, we're seeing tremendous investment in the unified experience platform market, where everyone is racing to be the 'single pane of glass' through which all things are viewed. HR technology vendors are aiming to provide more comprehensive services to customers to eliminate the need for other vendors, which includes an expansion into more non-HR functions.\"\n\nStaley believes HR vendors will continue to invest in creating improved user experiences and in updating the look, feel and navigation of their applications. \"User interfaces that were considered modern four or five years ago now feel dated, and vendors will need to keep their experience modern and fresh to stay competitive,\" he said.\n\nDave Zielinski is principal of Skiwood Communications, a business writing and editing company in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​Paid time off (PTO) doesn't sound like the most interesting part of an HR executive's job, but in 2020, Matthew Hamilton, vice president, people analytics and HRIS, at Birmingham, Ala.-based Protective Life Insurance Company, had PTO on his mind.\n\nAt Protective Life, which has 3,700 employees, part of Hamilton's job requires him to extract, examine, evaluate and present important employee data in order to discover insights, interpret the findings and communicate salient patterns of data to be shared with company leaders.\n\nLike many companies that increased their focus on health and well-being during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, executives at Protective Life encouraged their employees to rest and recharge as they adjusted to working from home during the lockdown.\n\nSince the pandemic, the number of remote workers at Protective Life rose from 20 percent of employees prior to March 2020 to 60 percent today. The remaining 40 percent are either hybrid or in-office workers.\n\n\"The company's leadership was very vocal with our employees and managers in 2020, telling them to use their PTO,\" Hamilton said. \"We urged managers to encourage employees to use their time off for their own mental health and well-being. Even if they couldn't go anywhere, we told them to take a staycation.\"\n\nEmployees' health and well-being wasn't the only reason Protective Life's managers encouraged their workers to take an extended break from their work schedules.\n\nCompany leaders wanted to prevent large numbers of unanticipated absences toward the end of 2020 as employees sought to use remaining PTO, which might have disrupted business operations.\n\n\"Another potential problem was if employees were poised to lose their PTO during 2020, they might request to carry over more time than the company's current PTO policy offers,\" Hamilton added.\n\nAs the issue of employee PTO became more urgent, Hamilton's curiosity grew. \"We began our in-depth PTO analysis in mid-2020, mainly at the time focusing on utilization and the pandemic,\" he said.\n\nTo launch the PTO analytics initiative, Hamilton leveraged employees' time-off data from UKG Pro, the company's human resource management system. The data was taken from employees who had worked more than a year at the company.\n\nThe data was fed into Visier's cloud-based people analytics tool, which brings together business data and people data and has built-in data management along with artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe software's ability to transform raw data into an analytics data model helped Hamilton meet his goal of analyzing PTO utilization versus voluntary resignations to see if there was a connection between the two. \"We saw a clear story there. The higher the average amount of PTO hours used, the lower the resignation rates, and the lower the amount of PTO hours used, the higher the resignation rates. When we looked across large groups of employees that's what we saw,\" Hamilton said.\n\nInspiration to analyze managers' influence on their direct employees' PTO decisions came after Hamilton read a Twitter post by April Koh, chief executive officer at mental health startup Spring Health. Koh wrote that when she announced her PTO for the rest of the year to her team, they announced theirs immediately afterward.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Hamilton set about comparing the average amount of PTO used by employees against the amount used by their direct managers and found that among those managers who used more of their own PTO, their employees on average did the same. Conversely, among managers who used less of their own PTO, on average their employees used less of their PTO.\n\n\"The entire purpose of this analysis was to be informative to our leaders, not to drive or track activity through it in and of itself,\" Hamilton said. \"I can't just turn all of that data and dump it on managers. They would not know how to consume it, what to prioritize or how to make sense of it.\"\n\nCurrently, Protective Life's analytics platform allows company leaders to continuously monitor employee PTO trends. Hamilton added that successful people analytics projects must include the right data to share with the right audience. HR managers and people analytics leaders should also effectively communicate a story to those with whom they are sharing data.\n\nUsing People Analytics Effectively\n\nAccording to data from Deloitte, companies can do more to reap the benefits of their people analytics efforts. While 74 percent of organizations frequently gather people data, only half (49 percent) frequently perform prescriptive activities such as providing insights.\n\nDeloitte's research also found that while more than 81 percent of organizations frequently produce reports, only 21 percent do the same for building models that can support predictive analytics.\n\nWhile software from SAP's Tableau, ChartHop, Microsoft Power BI and other people analytics platforms have helped organizations perform analyses that previously required advanced statistical skills, there are barriers facing people analytics efforts.\n\nStacia Garr, co-founder and principal analyst at RedThread Research, a Woodside, Calif.-based HR research firm, said people analytics teams often present the results of their analysis only to be told by company leaders that they don't believe the results.\n\nThere's also the ongoing difficulty of selecting, cleaning and integrating data, but these problems pale in comparison to others.\n\n\"Sure there's the challenge of data and data integration and all that stuff, but obviously for folks that have advanced technology and resources to support them, the data is sometimes the more solvable challenge,\" Garr said. \"It's the people and the politics and the alignment that can be a much bigger problem.\"\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "​Companies that share people data with business unit leaders across their organization stand a better chance of making effective decisions to change work processes and unleash employee productivity.\n\nThat's the conclusion of a recent report titled Sharing People Data Outside HR to Drive Business Value, published by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services and sponsored by Visier, a people analytics software company in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nIn addition to interviews with subject matter experts, human resource executives, academics and consultants, the report relied on a survey of 80 respondents, mainly knowledge workers, from 62 organizations with more than 2,000 employees. The companies are customers of Visier, which conducted the poll in June and July of 2021.\n\nForty-three percent of respondents described their company as \"advanced\" users of people analytics—those who use employee data beyond simple reports and metrics and are strategic about using the data to boost competitive advantage financially.\n\nExamples are cloud-based people analytics platforms equipped with application programming interface software to connect to large data sources, visual tools that illustrate data trends, and artificial intelligence and other software that can track workplace behaviors and employee sentiment data.\n\nBy contrast, 58 percent described themselves as \"emerging\" users of people data. They noted that they use employee data displayed on paper-based or spreadsheet-based formats that are nonstandardized and are transaction-, report- or dashboard-focused.\n\nThe report notes that 54 percent of advanced users said they use people analytics to achieve value in business outcomes, such as increasing revenue, improving margins and improving customer satisfaction, compared with just 11 percent of emerging users.\n\n\"Trying to run your business without good access to the insights you have about your people is like flying with one arm,\" said Ian Cook, vice president, people analytics at Visier.\n\nCook added that changes spurred on by the pandemic such as remote and hybrid work, the Great Resignation, an increasing focus on employees' mental health, skills shortages and employee retention efforts have elevated the people analytics agenda. However, understanding the employee through the lens of people data takes a level of sophistication.\n\nAlex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, put it this way: \"Companies that unlock their people data and share it with non-HR managers actually perform much better and are able to improve business processes and performance, as well as retain staff and attract new talent.\"\n\nSharing employee data with other business unit leaders can raise the HR manager's role to a new level of importance.\n\n\"Everywhere where HR business partners use people data elevates HR managers' relevance, it elevates their credibility, it changes the conversation and it positions them as the strategic advisor that they have always been striving to be,\" Cook said.\n\nAdvanced users of people data are also armed with the ability to make better decisions during the flow of work.\n\nThe survey showed that 62 percent of advanced users were able to empower their non-HR business leaders, such as financial, marketing, sales and operations managers, with the capabilities of choosing interventions or action steps, influencing decisions, and consulting on strategy, compared with only 39 percent of emerging users who said they could do the same.\n\nAdditionally, 21 percent of advanced users can build hypotheses and tell stories from the data, which emerging users haven't been able to do, the report states.\n\n\"A successful people analytics project requires figuring out what is the right data to share, who is the right audience and how to communicate a story to them,\" said Matthew Hamilton, vice president, people analytics and HRIS at Birmingham, Ala.- based Protective Life Insurance Company.\n\nLast year Protective Life, an insurance services company, began analyzing people data to drive insights into the correlation between paid-time-off usage and employee retention.\n\nAnother example is The LEGO Group, a Danish toy producer based in Billund, Denmark. The company allows non-HR managers to access pulse surveys that measure employee sentiment and engagement. The company also uses their people analytics platform to gain insights and take action on diversity and inclusion measures.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe report provides several recommendations to support HR executives who want to distribute people data to non-HR managers in an effort to achieve business value:\n\n*To tie employee-related activity to strategy and evidence that shows there is a return on investment in people data-driven decision-making, HR must combine people data with data from the finance department.\n\n*HR managers must articulate a vision for effective use of people data, establish a thoughtful rollout process and ensure non-HR leaders have access to the data they need to understand the value of actionable insights.\n\n*Providing data to non-HR business partners must be done with guardrails in place. Employee-related data should be anonymized in cases where, for example, an employee feels there will be retribution if they criticize a manager. Aggregating and anonymizing data is an important part of sharing people data.\n\n*Having clear policies that broadcast to workers how data is collected and used is another best practice for leveraging people data successfully.\n\n*A vision of a data-driven culture must be defined and supported by HR and business executives. Additionally, a center of excellence to support the widespread use of people analytics should be established.\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "Companies are spending more on ​IT right now. An Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) study found that almost two-thirds of organizations intended to increase IT spending in 2022. They especially planned to outlay more on cybersecurity, cloud-based applications and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSome of this spending is being done to offset a general skills crisis in IT. This is an effort to compensate, to some degree, for the struggle many HR departments face in filling urgent cybersecurity positions.\n\n\"There is plenty of funding in 2022 for security technologies and services that can help to offset this personnel shortage while making the existing staff more productive,\" said Jon Oltsik, an analyst with ESG.\n\nThe ESG survey found a distinct parallel between the areas of higher investment and the pain organizations face on the staffing and talent acquisition front.\n\n\"The technology areas that top the list for expected spending increases are also ones in which many organizations face a problematic skills shortage, as the demand for skilled workers in those areas continues to outpace the available supply,\" Oltsik said.\n\nMore than half of those surveyed said their organization has a shortage of cloud/IT architecture skills; 48 percent said they lacked people with the needed mix of cybersecurity skills.\n\nIn addition to investing in automation and technology to mitigate a severe lack of available IT and security talent, organizations are investing heavily in HR technology to improve recruitment success, reduce attrition and, in general, provide far more efficient human capital management (HCM).\n\n\"Business leaders in all industries are beginning to realize the value of investing in their workforce when facing hiring challenges, mass resignations and general uncertainty,\" said Evelyn McMullen, an analyst at Nucleus Research. \"Nucleus expects all eyes to remain on human capital management software providers in areas spanning talent, core HR and workforce management, and reassessing the talent acquisition processes, people and workforce management analytics, on-demand pay, and upskilling as critical trends to watch in 2022.\"\n\nHR Technology Investments\n\nFortune Business Insights projects that global human resource technology market spending will rise from $24 billion in 2021 to $35 billion by 2028. That's a rise of almost 6 percent per year. But what exactly are they spending on and why?\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, HCM, talent management, workforce management and payroll management are all hot tickets. As with IT as a whole, HR spending is favoring tools and platforms that provide AI capabilities, are cloud-based and come with built-in security.\n\nAI algorithms, for example, are being integrated into recruitment tools such as applicant tracking, social sensing and hiring platforms. AI and analytics, too, are being deployed to tie HR databases into various systems that measure enterprise and employee productivity.\n\nForecasting of future skills gaps is another way that analytics and AI are being harnessed in HR. With the ongoing push to use greener technologies and lower emissions as part of broader climate goals, gaps in future needs must be addressed. AI is being used to detect potential shortfalls in the years to come so that these can be addressed by urgent reskilling of the existing workforce, partnerships with schools to improve the educational pipeline and recruitment drives to bring in the needed resources.\n\nHCM specialists such as Cornerstone OnDemand, IBM and Workday are among the companies incorporating such features to boost sales. Talent management, too, is expected to perform well over the coming decade. Fortune Business Insights believes that talent management will play a vital role in areas such as acquisition, employee performance and career development, as well as succession management.\n\nCloud Spending\n\nCloud spending accounts for a big part of the increase in HR technology revenue. According to CloudHealth by VMware, enterprise cloud spending is set to rise by over 20 percent over the next few years. Those HR vendors with the most advanced cloud-based features are destined to benefit the most.\n\nJosh Bersin, founder of talent management consultancy Bersin & Associates, noted that investment is rising, too, in tools to improve employee satisfaction and ensure a smooth employee experience across the workplace.\n\nIn terms of verticals, ESG research noted that the biggest HR technology spenders will be banking and financial services, IT, telecommunications, manufacturing, retail and health care. But it is the IT and telecom segments that are leading the charge toward greater IT/HR technology convergence. Gone are the days when HR systems were in the back end and were the province of the few. Nowadays, they must be integrated with business management platforms as well as AI and analytics systems. And they must be able to operate in the cloud.\n\nRegionally, this combination of factors is driving spending in the North American HR segment from less than $12 billion a year currently to more than $17 billion by 2028, according to ESG. That makes it by far the largest area of HR spending.\n\nIn addition to the companies mentioned above, others destined to take advantage of this upsurge in HR investment include ADP, Ceridian, Cezanne, Infor, NetSuite, SAP, Talentsoft, and Ultimate Software. To succeed, they will have to provide HR tools that fuse together the needs of the business with the needs of its employees. According to consulting firm Mercer's Global Talent Trends 2022 report, 81 percent of employees feel at risk of burnout, up from 63 percent two years ago. Reasons include not feeling sufficiently rewarded for their efforts, lack of emotional well-being and a rise in stress levels.\n\n\"Employees are more stressed than ever before, and companies could be doing more in terms of offering a holistic and inclusive well-being strategy that meets the needs of a multi-generational and diverse workforce,\" said Ilya Bonic, president of Mercer's career business and head of strategy.\n\nDrew Robb is a freelance writer in Clearwater, Fla., specializing in IT and business.",

      "full_text": "​Data released by CompTIA shows that while there were 84,000 net new workers added to technology teams in September, the month also saw approximately 302,400 technology job postings, and all signs indicate that there could be prolonged hiring difficulties for employers in the foreseeable future.\n\nCompTIA, a Chicago-area nonprofit association for the information technology industry and workforce, relied on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for its analysis. The organization also said tech industry year-to-date employment is tracking 22 percent ahead of 2021.\n\nAs the economy wobbles under higher interest rates, inflation, the Great Resignation and the redesign of work since the pandemic, the tech sector has remained strong, according to Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA. In fact, the tech sector, as well as the broader economy, keeps producing new jobs.\n\n\"We do seem to be defying expectations,\" Herbert said. \"You could argue that companies are still coming out of the pandemic and they are still readjusting, but then there's also the overall macro trend. Companies are using technology now to support more business functions, and there is growing demand across a lot of different technology skills.\"\n\nCompTIA's analysis shows there is high demand for workers in areas such as software development and engineering, IT support, IT project management, systems engineering, and network engineering.\n\nHowever, recent announcements of layoffs suggest many tech companies are examining their bench of IT workers, terminating employees where necessary, and developing new approaches and technology features in a changing economy.\n\nIn recent months, several large technology companies have made workers redundant. Tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and Twitter have announced layoffs, saying they are restructuring their operations while evaluating and reprioritizing their business needs.\n\nA recent survey from Gartner highlights another problem. The survey of 18,000 employees in the fourth quarter of 2021, which included 1,755 employees in the IT function, found that globally only 29 percent of IT workers have high intent to stay with their current employer. The number is lower in Asia (19.6 percent), Australia and New Zealand (23.6 percent), and Latin America (27 percent). In Europe, the best performing region, only 4 in 10 IT workers (39.8 percent) have a high intent to stay in their positions.\n\nAs companies use more sophisticated technology, another trend is taking shape—companies are starting to see a reorganization and reorientation around different sets of skills and requirements, and this is having its own impact on IT workers, said Will Markow, vice president of applied research at Lightcast, a labor market analytics research firm in Moscow, Idaho.\n\nMarkow noted that during the past two and a half years, the nature of jobs and the skills within IT have evolved and matured. For example, cloud technology, cybersecurity and data analytics showed signs of robust growth and demand before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economy. The pandemic then established these technologies as some of the largest fields within IT, and their use is breaking down silos within IT while providing a bridge for worker engagement across different technology domains.\n\nOne example is skills related to data analytics. \"Employment for data scientist has grown more than 50 percent since 2019, making it some of the fastest growth we have seen in IT overall, but we are also seeing that workers in data analytics are increasingly being asked to work with other IT domains, whether it be engineers or cybersecurity professionals,\" Markow said. \"We are definitely seeing a breaking down of the walls between analytics and many other domains.\"\n\nThe pairing of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, and the fact that cloud has been paired with every other IT domain in some capacity, are further examples of what Markow describes as fusion of disparate IT domains with one another, which is having its own impact on tech employment.\n\nFor instance, there's been a noticeable shift away from asking skilled IT workers to apply their domain-specific expertise in a vacuum and much more of a desire to see them collaborate with other IT teams, which in turn necessitates new levels of teamwork and cross-functional collaboration, Markow observed.\n\n\"This type of fusion requires you, as an employer, to invest heavily in building new capabilities across different IT teams in ways that you didn't in the past, which means there is no existing training infrastructure in place to support that,\" he said.\n\nEmployers will be forced to upskill current workers or employ new tech workers in a labor market that is starved of skilled IT workers and is struggling with a declining labor force participation rate, decreased immigration rates and decreased birth rates. These factors will contribute to the difficulties employers will have as they try to fill higher-skilled IT roles in the near term.\n\n\"We just aren't going to have enough people to fill those roles, and automation is not quite at the point where we can fully rely on technology to pick up the slack,\" Markow said.\n\nHe added that a good strategy for HR executives to adopt is to identify talent within the company and to invest not only in workers that have tech skills but also among workers on nontechnical teams.\n\n\"One of the best hedges in a market with any uncertainty is to find ways to constantly invest and upskill your existing workers, and to use that in collaboration with other strategies to build your technical talent,\" Markow said.\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "​Can technology adequately support company culture in a hybrid or remote work environment? That's the question being asked by HR stakeholders now that virtual work is here to stay and tech companies are introducing new features to address the lack of in-office spontaneity that can encourage free-flowing creativity while staving off employee burnout.\n\nSince the pandemic began, company culture has been under pressure. The Great Resignation, 1 million U.S. deaths from COVID-19, racial injustice and the fight for union representation at several prominent organizations are just some of the societal trends that have raised workers' concerns and suspicions about how far companies will go to support their employees.\n\nAt the same time, a new wave of technological advancements has introduced new opportunities to capture workers' behaviors, their patterns of thinking and their sentiments. Chief among those technologies is artificial intelligence.\n\nMachine learning allows the technology to adapt to the individual, as opposed to previous \"big data\" tools that required workers to adapt to the technology, observed Paul Rubenstein, chief people officer at Visier, a people analytics company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\"We have to start seeing ourselves in the technology,\" he said. \"I don't think it's about technology replacing human interaction. I think it's about us using the technology to its fullest rather than being constrained or trapped by the technology and the way someone else designed it,\" Rubenstein said.\n\nHe added that a shift has occurred in the types of data that companies can collect on employees. Employers long have collected data such as when employees started their day, what they are working on and how many hours they worked, but this kind of data is not enough to effectively create a positive work experience, especially in the virtual work world.\n\n\"Employees should be able to look at data and see that they are not connected to enough people or they only talk to the same people or they are isolated,\" Rubenstein said. \"People need to see themselves in the data because it holds a mirror up to them. That's the first big shift. We have to have data gathering and data dissemination that helps everyone see a more human truth.\"\n\nUsing employee data to make decisions will be critical for employers as they figure out the best way to improve the remote-worker experience, especially if employers want to raise engagement and get the best performance from their employees.\n\nIn a survey conducted by Workday, 268 HR leaders were asked to rank the most important issues that they think will accelerate digital transformation across the wider business: 50 percent cited positive employee experiences as the most important issue. In second place, 45 percent of respondents said an increased focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is the most important.\n\nTo create positive experiences, technology companies are focusing on providing digital solutions that collapse the distance between employees and employers and digitize the aspects of work that occur during those unstructured, spur-of the-moment encounters. The aim is to incorporate human behavior into their software.\n\nFor example, Zoom has added gesture recognition features that allow users to raise their hands or give a thumbs-up when users want to express their feelings without interrupting the speaker.\n\nSalesforce's Slack recently introduced huddles, an audio-only conversation feature that the company says is designed to re-create—to the extent that technology can—the spontaneity of a quick in-office watercooler-type meeting or a pause at a colleague's desk to ask a question. The tool can also be used to help re-create a physical space where entire teams can convene, like marketing teams that often work together throughout the day.\n\nOracle recently introduced the Oracle ME (My Experience) platform, which consists of six modules that target corporate culture. The tools offer workflow guidance to help workers complete professional and personal activities ranging from onboarding or transferring to a new role to getting married or having a baby.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle ME makes it easier for employees to foster continuous engagement between employees and managers. The platform also helps to keep the workforce informed of changes, reinforce organizational culture and nurture connections among employees. This ultimately enhances workplace belonging and development.\n\nAccording to Zachary Chertok, research manager in employee experience at Needham, Mass.-based International Data Corp., when employers think about elements of the physical workplace, they have to consider how they'll equip both the organization and its employees with the tools to stay connected, engaged, collaboratively innovative and creative in problem-solving, regardless of the employees' work environment.\n\nEmployees, Chertok said, have to think about how they can work in a way that lets them set the pace, tone and equation for what work/life balance means for them.\n\n\"We are in an age where, at a strategic level, we are looking at the role that technology and, to a slightly lesser extent, data and prescriptive services plays in guiding organizations to that personal equity,\" Chertok said.\n\nHe added, \"It's no longer about one policy for everybody. It's about, 'Where can we introduce flexibility within the job and office and work requirements at the role level and at the personal level?' and making sure that those resources and choices are as equitably distributed as possible.\"\n\nIn the effort to grow a company culture that will thrive in the remote and hybrid work model, Rubenstein said, technology will have to do a better job of capturing and managing the kinds of spontaneous experiences that employees have with each other in traditional office environments.\n\n\"We need digital technologies that see how employees interact so that we can create an actual map of interactions and make sure that we are not leaving the best people behind,\" Rubenstein said.\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "​Human resource executives at companies that are investing in artificial intelligence (AI) technology can expect to scout for higher-skilled IT workers as demand for their skills rises. They will also be faced with managing labor composition disruptions and workforce reorganizations as more companies use AI's predictive technology capabilities to solve business problems.\n\nIn a recently published research paper titled Firm Investments in Artificial Intelligence Technologies and Changes in Workforce Composition, professors from Columbia University; the University of California, Berkeley; and the University of Maryland pored over almost a decade's worth of data and found that AI adoption will change the employment landscape as well as HR managers' priorities.\n\nResearchers examined changes in labor outcomes from 2010 to 2018 using several datasets, sourced from Cognism Inc., a London-based sales intelligence firm.\n\nResearchers also used 180 million job postings provided by Boston-based Burning Glass Technologies, an analytics software company that conducts research on labor market trends. The data details job descriptions and specific requirements such as years of education and experience.\n\nAdditional data sources were wage and education data grouped by commuting zone from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and wage and employment data grouped by industry from the U.S. Census Quarterly Workforce Indicators. From Compustat, researchers obtained firm-level data on operational variables such as sales, cash and assets.\n\nThe research shows that when companies invested in AI, there was a corresponding demand for workers who possess undergraduate and graduate degrees in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.\n\n\"As firms invest in AI, they tend to transition to more educated workforces, with higher shares of workers with undergraduate and graduate degrees and more specialization in STEM fields and IT and analysis skills,\" the report stated. \"Furthermore, AI investments are associated with a flattening of the firms' hierarchical structure, with significant increases in the share of workers at the junior level and decreases in shares of workers in middle-management and senior roles.\"\n\nJunior-level workers are those with less than two years of experience, or have two to five years of experience but do not manage anyone directly.\n\nA junior-level worker entering the workforce will know more about how to use AI data to make predictions, said Alex He, co-author of the report and assistant professor of finance at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. This is a shift from the days when managers were the ones who analyzed AI data, gained insights and made decisions accordingly.\n\nIn short, AI empowers junior-level workers—a shift that has implications for the worker/manager relationship.\n\n\"We found that AI is making the firm less top-heavy and flatter. It's not surprising, because AI has the ability to make predictions and that makes the entry-level workers more capable to make decisions. They can do more, and there is less need for middle managers,\" He said.\n\nAs companies that invest in AI operate with more employees in entry-level or single contributor roles and fewer workers in either middle management or senior positions, He predicted that several issues will arise that HR executives will be forced to manage in a restructured workforce.\n\n\"For example, right now, entry-level employees are paid less and managers are paid more, but if there are fewer managers, you can afford to pay the entry-level workers more to attract the required skills,\" He said.\n\nAnother significant finding is that there are some jobs that can't be replaced no matter how much investment is made in AI technology.\n\n\"Interestingly, firms that invest more heavily in AI do not reduce their demand for some of the skill groups that are most often predicted to be replaced by AI, such as customer service, HR, and legal,\" the report stated.\n\nJames Hodson is a co-author of the report. He is the chief science officer at Cognism and chief executive officer at the AI for Good Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Berkeley, Calif. Hodson said HR managers have an opportunity to use AI to hire highly skilled people, to reskill and train people faster, and to build more productive teams. AI also allows HR managers to track data on employees, which can help HR managers understand workers better.\n\nHowever, the report's findings present both difficulties and opportunities for HR managers who will be asked to oversee an AI-induced workforce reorganization while maintaining or even advancing the competitive advantage of their companies.\n\n\"In general, HR executives need to be aware of managing organizational change, especially when it relates to the adoption of AI technology. Essentially, AI is bringing the HR function to the forefront of the business,\" Hodson said.\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "​A ruling against the Biden administration's COVID-19 mask requirement for public transportation may have little impact on most employers, as many of them already have adopted or abandoned their masking policies. Nonetheless, employers may face questions about masking during business travel, such as whether employees are still required to mask while on work-related flights. We've gathered articles on the news from SHRM Online and other outlets.\n\nNational Mask Directive Struck Down\n\nA federal judge in Florida voided the national mask requirement covering planes and other public transportation as exceeding the authority of U.S. health officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) failed to justify its decision requiring masks and did not follow proper rulemaking, according to the judge.\n\n(CBS8 San Diego)\n\nDOJ Has Appealed Ruling\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced April 20 that it has appealed the ruling. The CDC had requested that the DOJ proceed with an appeal. The CDC stood behind the mask requirement on public transit when it called—prior to the ruling—for public transit users to wear masks until May 3 due to an uptick in cases from the BA.2 variant, a transmissible strain of the omicron variant.\n\n(CNBC) and (ABC News)\n\nSurvey Data on Company Mask Requirements\n\nMany companies already had dropped mask requirements for most of their workers or are planning to this year, according to data from risk management and insurance brokerage WTW, formerly Willis Towers Watson. The companies are choosing instead to focus on getting employees vaccinated and back in the office.\n\n(The Wall Street Journal)\n\nMasking While on Business Travel\n\nWhile the Transportation Security Administration will no longer require employees to wear masks on airplanes and public transit, employers still may require workers to mask up while on business travel. There could be circumstances where such a requirement could be justified—if an employer is in health care or is requiring workers to travel to and from communities considered areas of high transmission.\n\n(Fisher Phillips)\n\nSpike in Flight Cancellations Abroad\n\nAfter the U.K. dropped its mask requirement on planes, more pilots and flight attendants called in sick from COVID-19, resulting in a spate of flight cancellations.\n\n\"There is risk we may see some of that in North America, and it's all dependent on case rates,\" said Rob Morris, head of Ascend by Cirium, an airline analytics and consulting agency in London. \"But it will be relatively short term because airlines will adjust their capacity to manage demand and protect their network integrity.\"\n\n(CBS News)\n\nMore States Relax Pandemic-Related Masking Rules\n\nMany states are easing their mask requirements after COVID-19 cases declined from the winter spike caused by the omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\n(SHRM Online)",

      "full_text": "​Employers have invested in technology to solve challenges such as gathering employee insights and managing talent pipelines, but HR executives still have trouble benefiting from their technology implementations, according to a new report.\n\nReleased in early February, the PwC report revealed that the top three HR technology problems among HR leaders are difficulties with HR insights and data analytics, recruiting and hiring systems, and cloud transformation and modernization of HR systems.\n\nTo encourage employees to adopt technology that would drive HR goals, the report outlines measures that could help workers use HR technology more frequently. In reality, these measures aren't being deployed widely enough.\n\nOf note, 54 percent of respondents have adopted leadership communications and 54 percent have adopted training. Half (51 percent) have implemented mobile access to HR software, and less than half (44 percent) offer incentives to encourage HR technology use.\n\n\"Another option is combining some of the approaches cited in our survey,\" the report states. \"You can, for example, make incentives for usage and training part of gamification and provide mobile capabilities to 'play' the game anytime and anywhere. Reward employee adoption with spot bonuses, extra time off, company 'swag,' professional development opportunities or many other options.\"\n\nTechnology vendor relationships are also a concern to HR leaders. More than a third of respondents, 36 percent, said it's somewhat or very likely that they'll switch vendors at the end of the subscription term.\n\nDan Staley, PwC's HR technology leader, said sometimes it makes sense to switch vendors, especially if you are simplifying your portfolio and buying a product that has multiple modules to handle a variety of different HR business processes. On other occasions, HR leaders need to do a better job of choosing the right vendor.\n\n\"Organizations need to make sure they are doing their due diligence when they select a vendor,\" he said. \"Some things are avoidable, such as the organization not knowing their key needs and therefore not assessing the vendor's product appropriately.\"\n\nAs HR leaders look to robotic process automation, artificial intelligence and virtual reality tools to transform their human resource work processes, the report urges HR executives to build a compelling business case for disruptive technologies.\n\nThey must convince top managers to support disruptive technology; assess current operations to identify opportunities to drive efficiency, quality and productivity; and implement systems to track and measure results to support the case for further investments.\n\nAdditionally, HR leaders should focus on upskilling, particularly in the areas of data privacy and cybersecurity expertise.\n\nMaking a compelling business case for IT projects requires understanding the organization's needs first and foremost, said Robert Stokes, faculty member and founder of the master's degree program in HR analytics and management at American University in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"HR managers need to recognize that a business plan has to demonstrate that the cost or investment will result in short- and long-term gains that justify the cost,\" he said. \"HR leaders need to develop strong business acumen and project management skills to go along with their knowledge of the HR field. The rise of analytics in all areas of a business to stay competitive has made this need more evident.\"\n\nEmployee Monitoring\n\nStaley said the biggest surprise was finding out that the vast majority of HR leaders are pursuing ways to track the productivity of employees who are working remotely.\n\nNinety-five percent of respondents said they have either implemented new methods to track and report on productivity and performance metrics for remote workers, have a plan to do so, or are developing a plan now.\n\nStaley said in order to maintain and grow trust between employers and remote workers, companies should evaluate data that looks at overall employee performance rather than monitoring individual behavior.\n\n\"If it gets to the point where employers are monitoring what time did employees log in, what time did they log off, and are they active on their keyboard during the day—those are things that I think erode trust,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the best practice would be to track information about your employees at the aggregate level, such as measuring teaming or collaboration.\n\n\"You want to use monitoring tools as a barometer to assess how engaged is your workforce, are people becoming less engaged, are they not teaming, or are they not using collaboration tools,\" Staley said.\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "As a health care provider operating in a tight labor market, Allegheny Health Network in Pittsburgh needs to not only retain its current workers but also find new pools of potential employees. So why not target people who have retired or taken a break late in their careers?\n\n\"We knew there were a lot of nurses who kept their licenses current even though they were not practicing,\" says Claire Zangerle, the organization's chief nurse executive. She heard again and again that these nurses, and many other health care workers, were reluctant to return to work because of the lack of flexibility in scheduling and the long hours required per shift.\n\nTo address these concerns, Allegheny Health developed a program, which kicked off in 2017, to provide more flexibility for these professionals. \"Flexible scheduling is the foundation of the program,\" Zangerle says. \"If they don't want to work eight- or 12-hour shifts, we needed to let them work fewer hours per shift, but at least a four-hour block of time,\" she says. \"There is never a time when we don't need an extra set of hands.\"\n\nThe program, which is also available to current employees who want a change of status or schedule, has allowed the organization to retain some older nurses who are concerned about the physical toll full-time practice takes on them. \"They may want to retire because they don't know how much longer they can do the work,\" Zangerle says.\n\nThe initiative has become even more relevant lately. As the pandemic took hold in the U.S., the number of workers retiring increased. At the same time, the number of retired workers returning to the workforce declined. But this largely untapped pool of workers may be willing to return to work under the right circumstances.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City estimates that 2.8 million U.S. workers under age 75 have retired since February 2020. This represents a significant pool of potential employees for Allegheny Health and the countless employers across the country that are desperate to hire workers.\n\n\n\nPaving the Way\n\nIn a 24/7/365 work environment, flexible scheduling at Allegheny Health requires flexibility by management as well. People managers need the permission and freedom to be creative, along with the training and technology necessary to support these efforts.\n\nIn addition, nurses returning after time away need refreshers to ensure their clinical skills are up-to-date. This includes shadowing a nurse in a practice area where they want to work \"to get their legs back,\" Zangerle says. \"It's all about re-entry.\"\n\nThis type of retraining is often essential for older workers returning to the workforce after any length of time. The longer people are away from work, the harder it can be for them to return. Their skills can become outdated as technology and work processes change and the speed of everyday work increases. People who left the workforce when the pandemic began in March 2020 and now want to return to work may face significant challenges in doing so.\n\nGeneral Motors' Take Two program focuses on facilitating the return process for workers who have been out of the workforce for at least two years. While the program does not target any specific age demographic, it builds an on-ramp back to work for older workers by providing 12 weeks of onboarding, mentoring and orientation.\n\n\"This is designed to help them hit the ground running,\" says Tamberlin Golden, the company's executive director of workforce strategy. \"When they come back to the workforce, they don't have to figure it out on their own.\"\n\nThe program provides training in certain areas, including technology, to help participants expand and refresh their professional skills. Participants have worked in a number of areas in the company, including finance, software programming and software data analytics.\n\nEach worker in the program meets weekly with a mentor to discuss progress and challenges on the job. \"This is the time to assess opportunities for development and ensure access to self-paced learning to enhance their professional skills based on the recommendations set for them,\" Golden says.\n\nEmployers that are looking to build their own programs to help older workers transition back to the workplace can start with a pilot program. Make changes over time in accordance with participant and manager feedback and the performance of program alumni based on metrics such as retention levels. \"Start small and nurture the process,\" Golden recommends.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many older workers left the workforce to retire early, take a break because of caregiving responsibilities or attend to health concerns. The pace of retirements was especially brisk early in the pandemic. As a result, employers that want to recruit from this pool of potential workers are likely to find it is larger than expected.\n\nThe percentage of the U.S. population that is retired increased 1.3 percentage points between February 2020 and June 2021—most of which occurred during the height of the first wave of the pandemic and well before the first vaccines became available. By contrast, from 2010 to 2020, the number of retired workers increased only 0.3 percentage points, according to an analysis conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\n\n\"If the retirement share had risen at its 2010-2020 pace, the number of retirees would have increased by 1.5 million during the pandemic. Instead, the number of retirees increased by 3.6 million,\" according to the analysis. —J.S.\n\nDon't Forget Retention\n\nIt's also important to encourage older workers to remain on the job. \"Employers are starting to see years of knowledge walk out the door,\" says Candice Pokk, an organizational effectiveness consultant with benefits and human resources consulting firm Segal. In some cases, employers may not recognize what knowledge they will be missing until they need it. \"This could be someone working in the facilities department who knows how to handle hazardous materials or knows how to work a specific, but very important, valve on a piece of equipment,\" she says.\n\nTo avoid a knowledge drain, an organization's leaders need to keep tabs on retirement risks in the workforce and where those departures would leave the organization most vulnerable. With that information, employers can develop interventions to either capture older workers' knowledge before they retire or negotiate arrangements to keep them working longer.\n\n\n\nNo Data\n\n\"The most crucial metric is the percentage of employees retiring over the next five years,\" Pokk says. \"To retain older workers, employees need to have open and honest conversations about the employee's plans, how to handle knowledge transfer, and what the employee would need and want in order to stay on the job longer.\"\n\nHowever, any delay in retirement should be mutually beneficial, with goals attached. \"Companies don't want to retain just to do so,\" Pokk says. \"Be thoughtful about why you need to keep employees and what they are going to do if they stay.\"\n\nWhile many people focus on financial reasons for continuing to work, employers can also emphasize the sense of connection and affiliation that comes with having a job. Older workers drawn to these links may elect to stay on longer in a different role.\n\nFor example, such a role could revolve around coaching and mentoring younger employees who will step into the older worker's job when the time comes. A departing employee in this role also could dedicate a specific period of time to focus on knowledge capture before retiring. For example, the employee could be shadowed by other workers or make videos to create a knowledge archive of the work and what others need to know.\n\nExit interviews are a good time to discuss whether the employee is willing to stay with the organization in some other capacity, such as serving in a consulting role or doing project work. In this case, the employee could choose when and how the work is done.\n\nAt Allegheny Health, the organization strives to find the right approach for each individual. That might include the option of a hybrid position with a mix of work in the clinical setting and work that can be done on a computer from home. \"The key is to find ways to use their knowledge capital,\" Zangerle says.\n\nPart-time work or phased retirement can be important ways to keep people in positions that are hard to fill. For example, truck drivers, skilled tradespeople, and facilities and maintenance personnel are increasingly difficult to find, so employers may be able to persuade them to stay on by offering reduced hours, job sharing or increased wellness benefits to help them manage the physical demands of these roles.\n\nNo Data\n\nMaking It Work\n\nFrom a business standpoint, employers should be prepared to measure the impact of these re-entry or retention programs. \"Getting people back requires a lot of effort and energy, and employers don't always see a good return on that investment of time,\" Zangerle says.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of these initiatives, employers can look for improvements in retention levels, recruiting costs, time to fill vacant positions and staff workload, as well as quality scores and employee engagement levels.\n\nImportantly, employers should find ways to make older workers feel welcome and supported. For example, \"bringing a group of older workers on board at the same time can create a cohort effect as these workers bond during the transition back to work,\" says Carol Fishman Cohen, CEO of iRelaunch, a Miami-based consulting firm specializing in career re-entry. \"These people can be each other's sounding boards and cheerleaders.\"\n\nJoanne Sammer is  a New Jersey-based business and financial writer.\n\nExplore Further\n\nSHRM provide information and resources to help business leaders find and attract talent to meet their organizations' workforce needs.\n\nSHRM Toolkit: Employing Older WorkersFew organizations have taken steps to prepare adequately for issues associated with older workers remaining on the job, leaving the workforce or seeking new employment opportunities.\n\nAttracting and Retaining Older Workers to Your WorkplaceAlthough older workers today are better educated, live longer and stay in the workplace longer than those of previous generations, discrimination and outdated assumptions about them persist. Breaking down age bias can help organizations during the labor shortage.\n\nRecruiting Retirees: Opportunities, Barriers and Best PracticesCompanies are getting increasingly desperate, but desperation can spark new ways of thinking about how to fill vacancies. Often overlooked are retirees that represent a largely untapped source of promising talent to help stem the impacts of the Great Resignation.\n\nWelcoming Back Retired EmployeesIn a tight labor market, many companies are leaving no stone unturned. Some are looking to retired employees to fill open positions. While hiring retirees can present challenges, employers say there are numerous benefits.\n\nSHRM Resource Hub Page: Overcoming Workplace BiasAll workers have the right to equal opportunity in employment, free from discrimination, prejudice and bias.

      "full_text": "As more automation is added, systems are integrated, and sensors and Internet of Things devices are hooked up, a deluge of data is gathered that can rapidly swamp IT and HR systems.\n\nIn fact, it is already overwhelming some systems. Organizations, therefore, not only need to find a way to deploy technology to harness this data but also must prepare for a data deluge that is going to get much more severe in short order.\n\nHCM and Data Overload\n\nSystems for managing people, operations and strategies, such as human capital management (HCM) technology, already collect more data about the current workforce than organizations know what to do with, noted James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.\n\n\"The arrival of more automation tech also means that more data from those systems about the workforce is coming fast,\" he said. \"Organizations don't have a clue how to manage that employee data to lower risk, much less how to explore it to provide meaningful guidance to increase motivation and productivity.\"\n\nMcQuivey has observed a surge of sensitive workforce data over the past two years due to the widespread addition of collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams, as well as a host of systems to track employee behavior, keystrokes, activity levels, morale and employee sentiment; organizational network analysis to identify communication and social-technical networks within an organization; and even tapping into employee Fitbits and Apple Watches to keep wellness costs down. This new flood augments an HR department that is already equipped with increasingly more efficient tools to capture and store government identification numbers, dates of birth, payroll and bank details, benefits and medical information, background checks, and more. There is no doubt that data is exploding across the organization—particularly in HR.\n\nAnalytics Sophistication\n\nOne obvious approach to this growing mountain of HR data is analytics. Analytics applications are already in many areas. But these are mainly being used for marketing and high-level management. They need to be deployed far more heavily in HR, experts said.\n\n\"Leading organizations and vendors have started to manage these surges with ways to prevent data misuse while also ensuring positive, insightful workforce analytics to improve their workforce and business results,\" McQuivey said.\n\nWorkforce analytics is one of the fastest-growing segments of the HCM market. According to Forrester, the annual HCM tech growth rate of more than 15 percent means it will be almost a $2 billion market by 2025. If these systems continue in a business-as-usual fashion, they will accumulate mountains of information that organizations will not capitalize on.\n\nThat's one of the factors driving the adoption of more analytics tools in HR that add a great deal of automation to the decision-making process to eliminate manual labor and delays. Many vendors are adding such features to existing HCM systems to keep pace with the trend. Others are bringing new tools to market.\n\nSpanish multinational banking firm BBVA is using Visier Talent Advisor to reduce turnover in revenue-producing roles by 44 percent. Big HCM firms like Oracle and SAP are revamping their platforms with analytics and artificial intelligence to ensure they don't fall behind.\n\n\"AI and automation can take on the daily, routine and repetitive tasks,\" said Gabby Nizri, chief strategy officer at Resolve Systems, an IT automation provider in San Francisco. \"HR should consider simple, no-code, self-service solutions that can help automate the common HR processes to bring positive value to the company and that also benefit employees. For example, today's AI-powered virtual agents tied to key HR processes can fulfill important tasks for employees in an efficient and consistent way.\"\n\nThe toolset for AI and analytics applications will continue to evolve. Machine learning and deep learning platforms are entering the mainstream and will attain the same level of maturity as specialized data analytics. David Groombridge, an analyst at Gartner, believes such tools will help HR find ways to utilize the data it gathers to greatly improve decision-making. But it will take investment in automation and the use of augmented analytics, simulations and AI.\n\n\"By releasing creative new technology solutions in this area, you can scale and accelerate your organization's digitalization,\" Groombridge said. \"This will create applications more rapidly that can automate business activities, optimize AI and enable faster, smarter decisions.\"\n\nDrew Robb is a freelance writer in Clearwater, Fla., specializing in IT and business.",

      "full_text": "​A heightened focus in the C-suite on people analytics tied to the pandemic, along with challenges posed by a churning labor market, have made tools that report on and analyze workforce metrics more valued than ever among senior leaders.\n\nAs organizations struggle to retain employees, fill job openings and cope with upward pressure on employee compensation, CEOs, CFOs and other top executives more frequently turn to HR leaders for reliable measures to gauge how they're performing in those areas and help guide complex people-related decisions.\n\nIn response to that demand, providers of people analytics software have built new products or evolved existing ones to give leaders more accurate, real-time data on metrics like employee attrition rates, market compensation trends, recruiting performance, workforce vaccination status and return-to-office sentiment.\n\nStudies show that HR leaders are using more-specialized as well as more-versatile people analytics software to ensure they produce the most relevant and actionable data for their organizations' decision-makers.\n\nTalent Analytics in Growing Demand\n\nRecent research shows a growing demand for talent analytics both inside and outside of the HR function. A 2021 study of talent analytics leaders by Gartner found 72 percent said the demand for talent metrics in their organizations had grown since the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nAnother sign of the increased importance placed on HR metrics is recent growth in the size of people analytics teams. According to a 2021 study from Insight222, a people analytics research and consulting firm in London, people analytics teams in large companies now have an average ratio of one person for every 2,900 employees in their organizations, up from one in 4,000 in the preceding 12 months. The Insight222 study includes responses from people analytics leaders in 114 global companies.\n\nPandemic Spawns New Analytics Tools, Approaches\n\nThe pandemic forced providers of people analytics platforms to pivot and expand their offerings as HR leaders sought better ways of measuring remote-worker engagement and well-being as well as tracking new metrics like COVID-19 infection rates and vaccination status. New vendors also emerged with unique approaches around collecting HR data and sharing analytics best practices.\n\nOnce such provider is Knoetic, a company that combines a cloud-based analytics tool with a social network for chief people officers (CPOs) and CHROs that allows them to ask analytics-related questions of peers and share resources or best practices. It was designed to help alleviate a sense of isolation created by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1,000 HR leaders are part of the platform's social community, said Joseph Quan, founder and CEO of Knoetic. \"We built two pieces of software for the platform that emulate the right and left hemispheres of the brain,\" Quan said. \"The left brain is the people analytics tool that collects vast numbers of data points from a company's HRIS, ATS and other systems and creates a single source of truth around people analytics. The right brain is a social network for CPOs that allows them to ask questions and share answers around their toughest analytics challenges or other management issues.\"\n\nThe social networking side of the platform has outperformed the analytics side in terms of adoption, Quan said. \"There's a desire for community and social connection among HR executives, and I think the qualitative piece of analytics plays just as big a role as the quantitative side.\"\n\nQuan said use of the platform has grown as C-suite leaders seek more data from HR around issues such as rising employee attrition rates, hard-to-fill job openings and escalating compensation brought on by a fiercely competitive recruiting landscape.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing many more requests for retention data on the social networking side of our solution, but our users also are running more attrition reports,\" Quan said. \"It used to be they'd run those reports quarterly but now many do it monthly.\"\n\nNew Features for Employee Listening Platforms\n\nAmong the analytics tools HR leaders found most valuable during the pandemic were software platforms that allow them to easily collect and analyze employee feedback. Insight222's study found that \"employee listening and engagement\" was one of the top two areas where respondents believed people analytics added the most value to their organizations in 2021.\n\nSome employee listening platforms have added features that allow HR to solicit input from the workforce in new ways. Perceptyx, a people insights platform in Temecula, Calif., added a crowdsourcing tool that enables workers to vote on proposed ideas for process or policy improvement using a pairwise voting system.\n\nPepsiCo used the feature to help identify work processes that employees felt were impeding their success by posing the question, \"Name one process that stops you from getting things done fast.\" Employees were then asked to propose solutions to processes identified as flawed and vote on which overall solutions they deemed best.\n\nThe winning ideas led to PepsiCo's management streamlining the company's performance review structure and switching to a new videoconferencing software solution among other process changes, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nSuzanne Hanlon, vice president of employee insights and engagement for Comcast, uses Perceptyx for traditional employee surveying purposes but also to gauge worker sentiment around timely topics like Comcast's plans for returning to the office.\n\nComcast has used the platform to help understand employee perspectives on the company's operational protocols and policies around COVID-19. \"Based on that feedback our COVID response team has been able to adjust accordingly,\" Hanlon said. \"We saw an uptick in employee engagement in 2020, which we attribute in part to our demonstrated commitment to employee listening.\"\n\nGrowing Use of Specialized Analytics Software\n\nHR leaders also are increasingly turning to more specialized analytics software in their quest to provide more insightful and actionable people metrics to their organizations.\n\nInsight 222's study detailed \"three waves\" of investment in people analytics technology. The first wave are investments in analytics that are part of core HRIS platforms; the second wave includes investments in people analytics dashboards and \"data democratization\" tools that make analytics more accessible and easily-understood for nontechnical employees; and the third wave features investment in specialized people analytics tools.\n\nAmong those third-wave technologies are talent market analytics solutions like Gartner's Talent Neuron, LinkedIn's Talent Insights and Emsi Burning Glass, according to the Insight222 study. Third-wave tools also include workforce collaboration analysis tools such as Microsoft Workplace Analytics, TrustSphere and Polinode.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Insight222 survey respondents said they had invested in second- and third-wave tools in 2021.\n\n\"An increase in second- and third-wave technology investment suggests the majority of people analytics teams are preparing to tackle more complex work,\" authors of the Insight222 study wrote. \"Business leaders are increasingly looking for data on internal and external supply and demand of skills, continuous listening on employee feedback and a better understanding of employee networks, relationships and collaboration at work.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis.",

The Internet and rapidly advancing technologies, of course, have changed all of this.\n\nToday, busy HR and talent acquisition professionals clearly understand the power that technology can bring to their organizations across many stages of the talent acquisition process.\n\nTechnology plays a role \"from the application process, to processing applications on the back end, to completing the interview process and then onboarding our talent,\" said Debbie Connelly, senior vice president and chief people officer with Hyland, a content services provider in Westlake, Ohio. She's had a lot of experience with it: Connelly has been with Hyland for 25 years and, over that time, has seen the company grow from 30 to almost 4,000 employees globally. Technology has not only helped to automate the process but also freed up talent acquisition pros' time to focus on more strategic activities.\n\nAn Evolution of Tech Channels for Sourcing and Engaging Employees\n\nMonster.com was one of the first channels to evolve in the digital environment. Then came sites like LinkedIn, as well as industry- and position-specific channels to find applicants online. Today, though, even these sources are being eclipsed by more advanced technologies that use artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to help find and contact job candidates.\n\nHR leaders have used applicant tracking systems (ATS), which they coupled with new apps, to streamline the talent acquisition process. And, of course, no one could deny the value that videoconferencing technologies like Zoom added during the pandemic.\n\nToday, the demands on HR to quickly recruit top-notch employees is high, as employers navigate the new normal of remote and hybrid workforces, said Misty Guinn, director of customer advocacy for Benefitfocus, a software company in Charleston, S.C. \"As we are all starting to move forward in this new world of work and fully accept that many things will not return to the way they used to be before the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for employers to acquire and retain talent is coming back even stronger than before,\" Guinn said. The more that can be done to automate the talent acquisition process, the more effective recruiters can be.\n\nNew Technology Creates New Opportunities\n\nRandy Prout is talent acquisition manager at Plume Design in Palo Alto, Calif. Before LinkedIn emerged, he was \"basically cold calling through lists.\" LinkedIn was \"an absolute game changer,\" he said. However, he added, its efficacy is diminishing. While LinkedIn once provided Prout with about a 35 percent response rate, today that rate is around 8-9 percent, or even lower, he said.\n\nProut knew he needed to find ways to connect with a younger audience—people who were not in his network. He found a company called Findem, one of a number of similar online tools using technology to help recruiters find and contact potential applicants based on unique and specific search criteria—similar to, yet more advanced than, the people search options that LinkedIn offers. Comparable tools include Eightfold, Humantelligence, Yello, Recruiterbox and many more.\n\nProut uses Findem to contact potential candidates through automated \"drip\" e-mail campaigns. He's able to measure how well these campaigns work so he can improve his strategies over time. When potential candidates respond, they're immediately entered into the company's ATS, called Greenhouse, which automates the rest of the recruitment process.\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have applicant expectations, especially those who are younger, like Generation Z. They expect the process to be not only automated but also easy and intuitive to use. Employers that aren't providing that kind of user experience may risk losing out to other, more technologically savvy organizations and recruiters.\n\nTechnology to Stand Apart in a Competitive Labor Market\n\nEspecially in the current tight labor market, having technology that can streamline the process and improve the candidate experience is critical.\n\nColleen Stratton, global leader of workforce development at SEI, said her company recognized the need to improve the candidate experience about five years ago. \"We really felt that the candidate experience was a bit outdated,\" she said.\n\nSEI chose to invest in a system that would sit on top of its ATS and create a better front-end experience for the user. The system's vendor, Phenom, incorporates AI so that the user experience improves each time he or she interacts with the system. Internal candidates can also use the tool to ensure they're aware of positions that might interest them. \"We have at least 10 times as many candidates than we did before implementing it [the new system] in 2018,\" Stratton said.\n\nIt's the experience with technology that a candidate has with your organization that helps employers stand out, Connelly said. That starts, she said, with what postings look like and the ease of applying for a role, but continues with how recruiters are communicating with candidates, how they're using social media channels and how they're updating their practices so that they match candidate expectations.\n\n\"So if I'm trying to recruit a midcareer professional, I'm going to communicate with that person via e-mail or via LinkedIn,\" Connelly said. \"But if I'm trying to recruit a recent college graduate, I'm going to focus on Snapchat or Instagram or Twitter.\" Technology, she said, has to be tailored to the type of candidate companies are hoping to attract.\n\nHigh-Tech Is Great, But High Touch Is a Must\n\nWhat technology can't do, though, is replace the people-to-people connections required to hire the best candidates.\n\nConnelly said that while technology allows the talent acquisition team to think and act more strategically and to spend more time with candidates, it can't understand candidates and their needs and preferences, nor ultimately determine the best fit.\n\nLin Grensing-Pophal is a freelance writer in Chippewa Falls, Wis.",

      "full_text": "​When the recruiting team at Dropbox was looking to improve how it recruits diverse talent, it didn't rely on educated guesses or assumptions. To help inform their decisions, recruiters instead turned to analytics that were embedded in a recruiting technology platform.\n\nIn a presentation at the recent virtual HR Technology Conference and Exposition, Michael Moriarty, former global head of talent acquisition for Dropbox, an online storage and file-sharing company in San Francisco, told the audience how he worked to build a data-driven recruiting team at the company that leans heavily on analytics to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) hiring goals.\n\nMoriarity said his team uses analytics from the Gem technology platform, gathering metrics such as time candidates spend in each hiring stage, pass-through rates of phone screenings and other metrics tied to underrepresented groups, and gender among job applicants.\n\nRecruiters can review interview stages for different hiring managers by gender to see which managers might need help in balancing gender equity on their teams; analyze what percentage of their time is spent on phone screens with men compared to women and underrepresented groups; and track pass-through rates of hiring stages, including the rate that extended offers are accepted to help determine why some candidates may be declining offers.\n\nTracking such metrics helped the Dropbox team uncover some issues with its diversity recruiting in 2019. \"One thing we saw was about a 10 percent increase in the number of underrepresented candidates falling off at the phone-screen stage versus nondiverse candidates,\" Moriarity said.\n\nThe recruiting team looked more deeply into the issue and decided, as one of multiple steps, to revamp its phone-screen preparation process for all candidates. \"We wanted to help them better understand what was involved in the phone-screen process and the objective of that stage,\" he said. \"Over time we saw that metric come back up to the average fall-off rate for all candidates in phone screens. Being able to spot those kinds of trends is why having layers of recruiting data is so important.\"\n\nAs a result of the new data-driven strategy, 42 percent of Dropbox hires in 2020 were from underrepresented groups, Moriarity said, an improvement over previous years.\n\nThe growing role analytics are playing in employers' decision-making was highlighted in research and advisory firm Gartner's recent Data and Analytics Summit Americas 2021 conference. One recurring conference theme was how reliable data is becoming more vital to success in an uncertain and quickly evolving post-pandemic business environment. As a result, companies need to prioritize and embed more analytics throughout their operations—including HR—rather than farm out data analysis to information technology professionals.\n\nEvolution of the Recruiting Team\n\nTransforming the Dropbox recruiting team into a data-driven unit didn't happen overnight, Moriarty said. \"It's an evolution,\" he explained. \"We started with our sourcing team by showing them the value of being able to identify and understand candidate pipeline snags or bottlenecks so they could improve performance there.\"\n\nThe focus on analytics also has helped recruiting leaders manage the team more effectively. \"Using the data makes it easier for managers to coach or teach processes that can help,\" Moriarity said. \"Managers also can encourage peers on the team who might be having success using analytics to mentor or coach others.\"\n\nWorking with Stakeholders\n\nSuccess in diversity recruiting isn't just about generating and analyzing data, Moriarity said. Creating an open and trusting relationship with business partners such as hiring managers is also crucial to DE&I initiatives.\n\n\"Having good data is the first step in allowing us to be more transparent with hiring managers,\" Moriarity said. \"If, for some reason, we can't hire on time or there is some snag in a candidate pipeline, we'll quickly bring that to a hiring manager and explain our hypothesis of what is going on, based on the data. The trust we've built has allowed us to move faster and be more strategic collectively as recruiters and hiring managers working together.\"\n\nMoriarty told a story that underscored the importance of recruiting working hand-in-glove with stakeholders and balancing different analytics. In past years, his performance was weighted heavily on the metric of new candidates' accepted offers but not on how quickly those new hires then started on the job.\n\n\"In past years, we had exceeded our goal for offer accepts, but my partners in the company missed their targets [for quickly getting candidates on board] because of the delay between hiring and starting time,\" he said. \"Performance on those two metrics weren't aligned, so we worked on new processes and analytics to become more in sync so both parties could meet their goals. From our end, we decided to slow down for a while and put a pause on hiring. We realize it's not just about recruiting success but organizational success as a whole.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance writer and editor in Minneapolis.",

Only 23 percent expect stability sooner, the report shows. The Hackett Group is an advisory and technology consulting company based in Miami.\n\nThe report notes that companies will still be dealing with the coronavirus pandemic for some time, with the shift to remote work being one of the changes that is expected to last.\n\nThe report also found that most companies plan to bring on new technologies. Cloud computing; collaboration technologies; and digitization of processes, assets and content will be key areas of focus.\n\nHR technology is increasingly important to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations and to enhance the employee experience, said Anthony DiRomualdo, senior director of HR Research at The Hackett Group and co-author of the report.\n\n\"The big challenge in 2021 is putting in place the digital infrastructure, the digital service delivery model for HR so that it can be done in a sustainable way at scale,\" he said. He added that currently HR is using workarounds and temporary solutions to keep businesses running.\n\nAnother key issue, the report said, is improving HR's analytical, modeling and reporting capabilities. Most HR organizations haven't developed the necessary skills, tools, technology and infrastructure to capture and analyze employee data that gives insights into improving business and workforce decisions.\n\nData collection and analysis, DiRomualdo said, has frustrated companies for more than a decade. The emphasis on data analytics and predictive analytics will require skilled employees who can extract meaning, create a storyline and interpret what parts of the data are relevant to the co-worker who is trying to make a critical decision.\n\n\"Whether it is how we improve retention or how we identify employees who are likely to leave and what we can do to prevent that, data typically highlights a problem and it can help to inform the solutions,\" DiRomualdo said. \"Having staff that are comfortable with interpreting and using data as part of how they work in their roles is another area that HR has to continue to develop.\"\n\nSmaller companies often struggle to get the employees with the right skills to help a company make the jump from metrics to analytics to predicting events. There are other systemic problems too, said Julie Schweber, a senior HR Knowledge Advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\n\"At smaller organizations, they've got payroll on one system, benefits on a different system, and they are tracking time on an Excel spreadsheet,\" she said. \"Some smaller companies don't have any type of talent or applicant tracking system, so folks are doing that manually.\"\n\nIn these situations, HR managers will need to explain how digital technology and analytics can save thousands of dollars in work hours.\n\n\"This moves HR from tactical to a much more strategic position, and that's where HR can be of value,\" Schweber said. \"Usually in HR, we have to quantify that in dollars and time to the leadership team.\"\n\nShe added that if an HR manager can show how much manual processes cost and how technology can reduce inefficiencies while saving money, then the leadership team might be convinced to invest in technology.\n\n\"It's helpful to be able to frame the value of technology to the organization,\" she said. \"It demonstrates to the senior leadership of the company not just that it will make life easier for employees, but the value that it will bring to the company. That can be very helpful.\"\n\nThe report recommends that companies strive to meet the following goals:\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.",

      "full_text": "​The amount of data that organizations gathered on their employees grew exponentially during the pandemic. Whether employers collected information on workers' personal health and safety, harvested productivity data from remote monitoring tools, or identified how employees collaborate on internal networks, they likely know more now than they ever have about their workforces.\n\nSome experts believe this expanded data collection presents a growing problem, because many companies aren't transparent enough with their workers about why and how such data is gathered or haven't taken the right steps to ensure sensitive information is kept safe.\n\n\"Companies need to create end-to-end processes that ensure their decisions around collecting and using data are ethical and transparent,\" said Chantal Steen, global director of HR advisory services for research and consulting firm Gartner during a session at the firm's recent virtual ReimagineHR Conference. \"Very few employees trust their organizations to use data collected about them in the right ways. And that lack of trust and transparency can harm employee performance.\"\n\nGartner's research found employees who are treated as data partners––defined as those kept informed about why and how the organization gathers data about them and who are confident that information is protected—are willing to work harder for their companies. Almost 80 percent of survey respondents who feel they're treated as data partners said they're willing to put in extra effort to get the job done, versus 52 percent who don't feel like they are treated as partners.\n\nBut Gartner's research also found that less than 50 percent of employees trust their organization with their data and 44 percent don't receive any information regarding the data collected about them.\n\nIncreased Analytics Technologies and Practices\n\nMore than 90 percent of senior leaders have maintained or increased their use of talent analytics since the COVID-19 outbreak, according to Gartner. These leaders are employing technology systems and software to help gather more data than ever about employee health, remote employees' performance and collaboration, worker sentiment, and self-identification, Steen said.\n\nShe recommended three steps HR and talent analytics leaders can take to make ethical decisions about the data they collect and use.\n\n1. Create a clearly defined process that determines who the talent analytics team will partner with on projects.\n\nSteen said consulting with the legal department should be a starting point. Analytics teams need to form diverse partnerships with internal groups to decide how data will be gathered and used. \"Consulting with legal is only the front end of understanding the implications of data collection and use,\" she said. \"In the most successful organizations, the analytics team also partners with business unit leaders, with IT and sometimes with outside experts for their points of view on how data should be collected and used ethically.\"\n\n2. Embed an ethical framework in decision-making.\n\n\"When starting to collect new employee data, be very clear about your intent,\" Steen said. \"Why and how will that data be gathered, used and protected? It's not enough just to have conversations about it. An ethical framework must be embedded and operationalized in your processes.\"\n\nThat's important because similar types of data collection might be acceptable to some employees but objectionable to others. For example, workers might be open to employers collecting data on their activities to help make them safer at work. But if that same data is used to monitor who is working late and then used as part of performance reviews or ratings, some employees may object and lose confidence in the organization's data ethics code.\n\n3. Craft a two-way dialogue with employees.\n\nSteen suggested creating an open platform where employees can ask questions about data collection and use. \"Employees don't always know how you use data, and others don't trust their organizations in the way that data is used,\" she said. \"Employee trust is built or destroyed in times of extreme disruption like the COVID-19 pandemic. Now is the time to be more transparent with your workforce about your data practices.\"\n\nCreating an Employee Data Bill of Rights\n\nSome experts believe organizations should go a step further and create an employee data bill of rights. Elisabeth Joyce, vice president and advisory team leader at Gartner, told the audience at the ReimagineHR Conference that just as many businesses now spell out for consumers their data rights, organizations should be equally explicit with their employees about such rights.\n\n\"Are employees clear on what data is collected and how it's used and protected, and are those rights explicitly communicated?\" Joyce asked. \"For the most part, the answer is no. The analytics landscape has accelerated, and organizations need to address the data expectations of employees before those expectations are addressed in the courts or in the media.\"\n\nTo address the problem, Joyce suggested organizations create an employee data bill of rights with four key tenets. Privacy is not listed as a core right on this list, Joyce said, because the bill of rights is intended to balance employee privacy with the legitimate and necessary analytics employers need to collect.\n\n\"These employee data rights should go beyond table stakes like adhering to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation,\" she said. \"They should evaluate those data questions that are currently unregulated.\"\n\nThe four tenets in the bill of rights are:\n\nThe Right to Purpose. Employees should have the right to expect employers will have a legitimate purpose for using data collected about them. \"Employee health certifications around COVID-19 shouldn't be used for benefits determination, for example. [They should be used] only to ensure people are healthy when they return to the workplace,\" Joyce said. The Right to Minimization. Employees should have a right to expect their employers will only collect the minimum amount of data needed to meet the intended purpose.The Right to Fairness. This is the right for employees to know their data will be used fairly. Here, organizations should consider potential second- and third-order effects from data gathering, Joyce said. Take productivity monitoring of remote workers, for example. Such data might also be used for things like recognizing people for above-and-beyond contributions, which could incentivize burnout, she said.The Right to Awareness. Joyce said this is the crux of creating a good data partnership with employees. \"Workers should have the right to know what types of collected data are being used for what purposes and any changes made to that,\" she said.\n\nOrganizations also need to identify any restrictions to sharing information about data collection and use. \"Awareness does not mean full transparency,\" Joyce said. \"Companies are not compelled to share everything, but they do need a legitimate reason when they don't share information about data collection or use.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​HR data analytics have become more critical to the human resources team at Humana Inc. as the health insurance company learns more about how its employees are coping during the deadliest pandemic in 100 years.\n\nRoger Cude, senior vice president, human resources at Humana, said that while HR data analytics have always been critical, the ability to use or analyze the data is often an under-resourced capability. The COVID-19 pandemic might change that, deepening the approach used prior to the pandemic—having a knowledgeable team of analysts, a strong process for using data and insights to make decisions, and a solid data infrastructure—and compounding the scale, depth and scope of these necessary capabilities.\n\n\"You will know quickly whether your data analytics capability can handle the demand, or if it needs improvement. If you have not invested in this capability, it will soon become apparent that this is an essential capability for success,\" he said.\n\nUnderstand Employees Better\n\nCompany executives say that the COVID-19 pandemic has raised awareness of the need for data analytics capabilities at Humana, headquartered in Louisville, Ky. Leaders have used several strategies to find out more about what their workers' needs are at a time when more than 90 percent of Humana's workforce of approximately 46,000 currently works from home.\n\nThey've used measures such as:\n\nCreating open-ended survey questions and continually sampling employees.Leveraging behavioral data like meeting hours, e-mail and network collaboration.Running natural language processing and machine learning algorithms on internal social media platforms. Collecting and merging facility utilization, safety and security, IT (network/system) data, and risk and compliance data into their existing HR data warehouse.\n\nCude said gathering and analyzing employee data have helped the company make decisions at a time of great change and risk. For instance, he said, based on the data analytics, Humana discovered that many people needed special accommodations to be available to work.\n\n\"We categorized this data by various needs and assessed the impact. In turn, we developed new benefits, procedures and practices to care for our associates while maintaining performance and productivity. For example, we provided opportunities for employees to take additional paid time off for child care or caregiving,\" he said.\n\nHumana also used data analytics to boost employees' confidence in returning to the company's facilities. By using safety and security data, facility data, and listening assessments, the company analyzed employee readiness and gained a better understanding of why staff might or might not be confident in returning to the office.\n\n\"This information was then used for the new processes and protocols,\" Cude said. \"We studied employee sentiment after reorientation and training. The result was that 85 percent of this population became confident, significantly higher than previous sentiment.\"\n\nHumana also captured new data that illuminate \"ways of working\" by studying patterns in meeting hours, focus time, after-hours work, networking and e-mail/IM usage.\n\nThe company's data analytics showed employees tend to work longer days, may not be proficient in leading virtual teams, and are meeting more often and with larger groups.\n\n\"Through this analysis, we have been able to create new guidelines and processes to minimize 'collaboration overload,' and better prioritize and establish better leader/employee routines like one-on-one meetings across the company. Lastly, this data plus the ongoing listening is aiding in the development of Humana's strategy for the future of work,\" Cude said.\n\nPlan for the Future\n\nAs workers continue to work from home, data used to evaluate employee productivity and engagement will become more important, said Gavin Morton, head of people and financial operations at HR.com.\n\nMorton noted that HR professionals should focus on data that show differences between remote workers and onsite workers for insights that can help them with workforce planning as the coronavirus continues to impact the workforce.\n\nHe also said the data can help HR managers answer questions such as: How do you know which workers are available? How will you know who to bring back into the office? If an employee tests positive, will he or she be able to work?\n\n\"If you've got a system that can help you with workforce analytics and if you have not been using it to its maximum effectiveness, now is the time to do so. If you did not have the rest of the leadership team's buy-in before, you sure should get it now,\" Morton said.\n\nHR managers can expect corporate investments on data analytics to increase. The latest research from Frost and Sullivan predicts that the global big data analytics market will grow from $14.85 billion in 2019 to $68.09 billion by 2025.\n\nStore New and Existing Data\n\nOver the last six months, data analytics has become a more demanding process at The Christman Company, a Lansing, Mich., construction firm. The company has 200 union and 600 nonunion staff and up to 50 additional employees depending on how many workers each construction project requires.\n\nAccording to Annette Scott, payroll manager, there is a greater focus on tracking employees who meet the requirements of the employee retention credit (ERC), which is a refundable tax credit for certain employees and is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.\n\n\"When COVID-19 hit we had to start tracking what requirements employees met for them to apply for the ERC. We had to add an additional layer of data monitoring and analysis to our system to do this,\" Scott said.\n\nTo keep its business profitable, Christman must analyze datasets including financial information, project management, employee hours of work on a site, what phases of a construction process are being charged—such as planning, preconstruction, construction or closeout—and whether workers are to be paid minimum-wage rates or union contract wages.\n\n\"The ability of the Christman team to quickly and accurately analyze various financial metrics in real time is critical to ensuring successful projects for both Christman and their customers,\" Scott said.\n\nAs companies in many sectors face the burden of managing more employee data and are gaining new insights about employees during the pandemic, HR managers will have to find the best way to manage data to get actionable insights on their workers' performance, Cude said.\n\nHe recommended employers should develop a plan that systematically stores new data with existing data, even if the process is manual at first. Companies should also identify data subject matter experts as new data is identified or needed and bring them into the matrixed team.\n\nCude's advice to HR data analytics teams is this: \"Be agile and iterative in interpretation and action. Do not wait until everything is perfect because it never will be. On the other hand, do not feel compelled to act on every piece of information. Look for significant trends and indicators.\"\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami. She covers business, technology and public policy.",

      "full_text": "​Not too long ago, \"bumping into\" someone on the street or at the grocery store was an opportunity for a brief human connection that might end in a hug or a handshake and a promise to get together soon. Today, hugs and handshakes are dangerous, in-person interaction is discouraged, and we're left feeling socially adrift.\n\nMany of us have felt isolated at some point during the coronavirus pandemic. As COVID-19 has forcefully swept across the world, it has caused a ripple effect of loneliness for millions of people in every sector of the workforce. No one is immune from the feelings of isolation that this contagion has caused. When loneliness becomes a chronic experience, it can harm our health and well-being.\n\nLeaders have a responsibility to help mitigate workplace isolation. They need to prioritize social connections in these unprecedented times of social distancing and remote work. Since random lunchroom run-ins and deskside drop-bys are no longer a given—even after employees are asked to return to their workplaces—new approaches will be needed to foster healthy relationships at a distance. Absent that, workplaces will feel the aftershocks of isolation and burnout long after the pandemic is over.\n\nAdapting to Alone Time\n\nTo reduce the spread of COVID-19, millions of employees worldwide began working from home this spring. (In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Mark Barrenechea, CEO of software company OpenText, estimated that up to 300 million people switched to teleworking at the start of the pandemic). Business leaders who once thought it was impossible for their workforce to be remote now realize that it is quite possible. That is likely to lead to an increase in telework and virtual events in the coming years.\n\nFor those who enjoy working remotely, this is great news. However, surveys show that loneliness is one of the biggest struggles employees experience when teleworking.\n\nThe problem is compounded by the increasing number of people who live alone, which was once rare. Now, single-person households are the second most-common type of U.S. household—just behind married couples without minor children and even more prevalent than married couples with children under 18. In many urban centers, roughly 40 percent of households are single-occupant.\n\nThe trend to live alone raises concerns among mental health experts. Studies have found that it is linked to depression, lower quality of life and health problems.\n\nMillennials, who make up the largest segment of the workforce, are the loneliest generation. Three in 10 Millennials always or often feel lonely, according to a poll by YouGov, a London-based research and analytics company. At work, 66 percent of Millennials found it hard to make friends, compared to less than 23 percent of Baby Boomers, according to a 2018 survey from U.K.-based Milkround, a student and graduate career resources company.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendships and social interactions are basic psychological requirements for human well-being. It's also critically important to have friends at work. A survey by LinkedIn analyzed the impact of workplace relationships for 11,500 full-time professionals between the ages of 18 and 65 in 14 countries. Forty-six percent said that work friendships make them happier.\n\nGallup's research has repeatedly shown a \"concrete link between having a best friend at work and the amount of effort employees expend in their job.\" Additionally, \"women who strongly agree they have a best friend at work are more than twice as likely to be engaged [63 percent] than women who say otherwise [29 percent].\"\n\nPersonal connection isn't just good for engagement and happiness at work, it's what makes us human. It's part of our genetic makeup. This deeply ingrained evolutionary legacy goes back to the days when our survival depended on safety in numbers. Today, work is where we often find our tribe.\n\nEffective Virtual Team Building\n\nBy some accounts, before the pandemic struck, technology was losing its spark as a human connector. People were pushing back on social media, feeling a deep need to spend more time together IRL (in real life).\n\nOveruse of digital technology and social media contributes to loneliness, according to recent studies. That's true even at work. Far too often, people choose technology as a default communication tool. It's common for people seated at their desks to send messages via e-mail or Slack to their co-workers who are a few feet away. Loneliness in some workplaces grew as in-person interactions slowed and digital collaboration picked up speed.\n\nBut in the time of COVID-19, for most leaders, virtual collaboration is a beacon of light in a dark world. It's an emotional life raft, keeping us afloat as we navigate work and life under lockdown and social isolation. Once seen as a cause of loneliness, technology has now been tasked as the cure.\n\nVirtual technology \"allows employees to meet and collaboratively work in the comfort of their homes,\" says Lisa Kaye, president of Greenlight Jobs, a media and entertainment jobs site. \"This new work environment affords a level of privacy and productivity whilst observing the necessary safety precautions. It will forever change the way we live and work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKunal Gupta, CEO of tech firm Polar, wants new leaders to emphasize well-being, and he has taken the lead virtually. \"I've started to host daily live meditations each morning for my team and clients, in addition to encouraging them to also find what works for them and to make the space for it,\" he says.\n\nThe team at Grain Farmers, a Canadian nonprofit group that represents farmers' interests, is staying connected in several ways. \"We have a staff website where we post a joke and a funny quote each day,\" says Sarah Plater, human resource leader. \"We also share pictures of the pets that keep us company in our home workspaces. We have a gratitude channel [on Microsoft Teams] where people share what they are grateful for each day.\"\n\nOther examples of technology being used as a social connector:\n\nVox Media hosts an online story time for kids, and even CEO Jim Bankoff participates.General Assembly, which offers courses in coding, is re-creating the morning coffee break. Staff members spend a few minutes each morning catching up on nonwork-related topics.Software company Basecamp has dedicated social media channels where no work-related discussions are allowed; topics are focused on food, sports, pets and humor. The channels are also free from talk about the pandemic. Similarly, GitLab has a \"feel good\" Slack channel with only positive stories posted by employees to read, share and discuss.The New York Times hosted a pet parade featuring staff working from home and their pets.Some companies are starting virtual book clubs, team-bonding movie nights, virtual pizza parties or remote happy hours where employees dial in and share a cocktail over Zoom or Skype.Many businesses still celebrate birthdays by having a monthly lunch where workers gather virtually to toast their colleagues.\n\nThese ideas demonstrate that it's entirely possible to help people connect while working remotely. It may be imperfect, and many employees will still long for moments of physical human interactions, but with a bit of regular levity and fun, leaders can make the work-from-home experience a little less lonely.\n\nNotably, these interactions aren't focused on work. Instead, they're simply a means to foster relationships and help people battle loneliness and isolation. For some, it may feel uncomfortable to share in large groups. That's an opportunity for leaders to encourage these people to use micro-channels to connect in one-on-one interactions and within small teams.\n\nNow is no time to fear that nonwork-related conversations may decrease productivity. If access to these tools are limited, companies will appear tone-deaf and insensitive. In times of extreme stress, leaders need to behave compassionately and back whatever means necessary to drive social collaboration and peer support.\n\nLoneliness After the Pandemic\n\nSome business leaders emphasize that a shared, physical workplace creates the conditions for human connection that are hard to recreate virtually. \"Work, like any other social gathering, such as weddings, birthdays and dinner parties, fosters our natural inclination to engage, share and find affinity with others,\" says Shaival Shah, co-founder and CEO of Ribbon, which helps homebuyers finance purchases. \"Sharing and receiving are critical human ingredients to being a part of something larger than ourselves and not living a life of isolation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Data\n\n\n\n\n\nWith remote work, employees \"lose that incredible ability to gather and unite,\" Shah says. \"Teams across the world are taking heroic efforts to reinvent the way we engage over video and the phone, but nothing will replace the ambiance, sounds and sights of being together.\"\n\nIn effect, the pandemic may serve as a reminder of what we value most. \"This period, which none of us may have ever experienced [before], could be a wake-up call to us all,\" says Ami Rokach, an associate professor of psychology at the Center for Academic Studies in Israel and a member of the psychology departments at York University in Canada and Walden University in Minneapolis. \"This period may remind us of how much we longed for a hug, for real human contact, for warmth and support, which requires mostly face-to-face interaction. We may learn now to relate more meaningfully to others, to appreciate them and to realize how much we need them in our lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Data\n\n\n\nBattling loneliness and chronic stress even in normal times can be exhausting. As today's employees face additional stress and isolation, leaders can do their part by finding novel and positive ways to create connections. By checking in and setting up spaces for workers to collaborate and connect, leaders demonstrate that employee well-being is top of mind.\n\nJennifer Moss is author of Unlocking Happiness at Work (Kogan Page, 2016) and co-founder of Plasticity Labs, a Waterloo, Ontario, Canada-based research and consulting company that focuses on organizational culture.\n\nExplore Further\n\n\n\n",

      "full_text": "​The notion that organizations can predict when top performers are considering moving on to greener pastures and then intervene in ways that convince them to stay is alluring. An entire category of predictive analytics tools has sprung up to make that sooth-saying vision a reality. These flight risk models have grown popular as organizations grapple with a labor market where it's increasingly difficult to find good replacements when employees leave.\n\nPredictive analytics software that's designed to forecast employee flight risk typically measures factors like engagement levels at work, time since last promotion, absenteeism, changes in performance review ratings or even data like commute time and activity on LinkedIn profiles. These models often use algorithms that correlate the patterns of employees who have voluntarily left the organization with those of existing workers to create a flight risk score.\n\nUsed in the right manner, such data can help companies identify the top factors causing employee attrition and take preemptive steps to help stem the unwanted outflow. But experts say data that emerges from flight risk models is too often used in suspect or even harmful ways and managers aren't always trained in how to apply these sensitive findings in a productive fashion.\n\n[SHRM members-only platform: SHRM Connect]\n\nPitfalls of Predictive Tools\n\nOne problem arises when companies choose to identify the individual employees deemed at risk of leaving rather than reporting anonymous data to managers or executives.\n\n\"A manager can never un-know that information or un-see it,\" said Helen Poitevin, a Paris-based vice president and analyst who covers HCM technologies for research and advisory firm Gartner. \"Will having that information now influence every decision or interaction they have with employees who are deemed flight risks?\"\n\nBen Eubanks, principal analyst for Lighthouse Research and Advisory in Huntsville, Ala., said using analytics to project and head off employee attrition can be a powerful tool but should be used with care.\n\n\"Employers need to be careful not to use these analytics as a decision tool but rather as a decision support tool,\" Eubanks said. For example, if managers have employees who are considered a flight risk, they may not offer them a new training course or development opportunity, even though data says that growth opportunities are a major factor in keeping many employees loyal to an organization.\n\nGeorge LaRocque, founder and principal analyst of HRWins, an HR technology research and advisory firm in New York City, said how effective flight risk assessments are depends both on the quality of the data generated and how that information is used by managers.\n\n\"Managers typically haven't been trained in how to have difficult conversations with employees,\" he added. \"It's a scary proposition if you are identifying or naming individuals who you think are flight risks but not providing a lot of guidance to managers in how to engage with their people about red flags that may or may not indicate a high intention to leave.\"\n\nLaRocque cited the example of using commute time as one predictor of employee attrition. \"Maybe an employee is going through something difficult in their life and has to temporarily move in with a friend or family member, which adds 30 minutes to their commute time,\" he said. \"Factors like those can be false positives. Data collection and analysis needs to be rigorous and managers should be able to have conversations with their people in ways that don't put them on the spot and end up actually forcing attrition when it could have been avoided.\"\n\nThere's also the matter of the accuracy of flight risk tools. Poitevin is skeptical of some vendors' claims that they can predict with 90 percent or better accuracy which employees are likely to depart in the near future.\n\n\"For flight risk, a 70 or 80 percent accuracy level is generally what you're looking for, given the many variables involved,\" she said. \"There's a danger in having too many false positives in these predictions. You have to allow for some error when there are factors you don't know or may not have quality data about, because human behavior can be unpredictable.\"\n\nHow to Use Flight Risk Data Productively\n\nSuch pitfalls can be avoided if organizations commit only to reporting aggregated flight risk data rather than identifying individuals, Poitevin said. \"When companies are very careful about the data sources they're using to make these decisions and when they're using the data to inform better overall strategies about improving employee retention, then the tools can have value,\" she said.\n\nLaRocque agrees that such anonymity in reporting is key. \"It's often more valuable for managers to know they have some issues they need to look at holistically on their teams,\" he said. \"Knowing you have some flight risks on your team in general may make you approach things like your management style, developmental opportunities for individuals or workforce planning differently.\"\n\nMatthew Stevenson, a partner and co-leader of the workforce strategy and analytics practice with the consulting firm Mercer in Washington, D.C., said flight risk models that rely only on internal and not external data also can be problematic.\n\n\"Many of the datasets only contain information about what's happening internally with employees and say nothing about what the competition is doing, what the market pay rates are for similar jobs or external labor market data like the unemployment rate,\" Stevenson said, factors that can weigh heavily in employees' decisions to stay or move on.\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​SEATTLE—HR professionals play a critical role in getting their organizations to use data and analytics strategically to compete more effectively.\n\nJack Phillips, CEO and co-founder of the Portland, Ore.-based International Institute for Analytics, a research and benchmarking services firm for the analytics industry, urged attendees at the Society for Human Resource Management People Analytics conference on Jan. 14 to get focused on data.\n\n\"It's proven that the use of data analytics improves overall company performance,\" he said. \"Organizations invest in many things, but budget dedicated to data and analytics is limited. It needs to be a top priority. The broad use of data and analytics will differentiate the companies  [from those] that eventually are disrupted and disappear from the survivors.\"\n\nAnd HR is key to the success of winning with data, from sourcing the necessary talent and applying analytics to HR functions to leading change management when adopting a data-driven mindset across the organization.\n\nImplementing the technology is the easy part, Phillips said. Getting your workforce to truly adopt data analytics across the organization is harder. Ultimately HR is responsible for managing that transformational change.\n\n[SHRM members-only platform: SHRM Connect]\n\nData Analytics Overview\n\nThe data analytics market is in full growth mode, accelerated by the explosion of cloud computing. The technology environment is moving so quickly that it is very hard to keep track of the increasing array and complexity of analytics technology available, Phillips said. But the top-performing companies are investing heavily in data analytics.\n\n\"If you are not paying attention through expenditure and [acquisition of] talent you will be behind,\" he said.\n\nPhillips outlined a maturity model showing the sophistication levels of an organization's approach to analytics. Employers aiming to improve their data analytics function first need to assess where they currently are. Phillips' model includes those at the bottom stages who don't use any data to make business decisions and companies where data analytics may exist in silos without a structure for collaborating across business units.\n\nMost employers likely exist in one of these stages, while many enterprise-level organizations are in the higher aspirational stages where the value of analytics is expressed, or they are data-oriented and use analytics with some internal coordination.\n\n\"Only one company we've studied [Amazon] has achieved near perfection as a data-driven company,\" Phillips said. \"You don't come to a meeting without data [at Amazon]. No gut-based decision-making is allowed. Everything is driven by data.\"\n\nSucceeding with Data\n\nAccording to Phillips, the key ingredients needed to achieve higher levels of maturity as a data-driven organization include:\n\nPeople with data analytics skills. Organizational structure, processes and technologies in place for those people.Use of the data. \"The highest performing companies have superior capabilities on the supply side and business leaders who use the insights that the data analytics teams are providing to drive the business forward,\" he said.\n\nAnother model he presented breaks down the elements that must be in alignment for companies to succeed with their analytics initiatives. \"Without alignment, organizations run the risk of poor or limited results,\" he said. \"To make real progress and become a data-driven organization, the capabilities and assets of these five elements must evolve and mature.\" The five elements are:\n\nData. It may seem obvious, but to provide meaningful analytics, data must be high quality, organized, reliable, integrated, and accessible. The raw material must be right.\n\nCoordination. Companies must advocate a single and consistent perspective for analytics across the organization.\n\nLeadership. Senior leadership should fully embrace analytics and lead company culture toward data-driven decision-making.\n\nTargets. The organization should prioritize business targets against which it will apply its analytics. \"Data and analytics without a targeted reason for it is worthless,\" he said.\n\nTalent. Organizations require analytical talent that covers a range of skills from accomplished data scientists to rank-and-file employees who embrace being more analytical in how they do their job.\n\nEmployers must also understand rapidly emerging analytical techniques and technologies, Phillips said. The widespread adoption of open source tools has resulted in an explosion of analytical methods and techniques, and with the advent of big data, machine learning and cloud computing, creating an effective technology strategy for analytics is a critical ingredient for success.\n\nHR's Role\n\nHuman resource professionals play an important part in getting their organizations up to speed and competitive with analytics, including sourcing the right qualified talent—a difficult task in a labor market lacking the requisite skills—and investing in data analytics for its own functions.\n\n\"HR lags behind other business functions when it comes to using data analytics,\" Phillips said. \"Sales, marketing and finance tend to outpace other parts of the business.\"\n\nHR should be assertive with leadership when advising on budget and staffing for data analytics positions and in creating and managing a workplace culture that values innovation.\n\n\"The top performing companies treat their data analytics function as a product, with design thinking and intentional product management,\" Phillips said.\n\nOne positive for employers who may be overwhelmed by implementing a data analytics function is that best practices are easily transferable. \"There are many things that you can just copy,\" he said.",

      "full_text": "​Traditional job interviews leave something to be desired. Relying on hiring managers to handle them without injecting some level of personal bias is fraught with risk, and the fact that many busy managers would rather not spend time interviewing candidates in the first place only compounds the problem.\n\nEnter the Tengai HR robot. This 16-inch-tall robotic device gets right to the task without stopping to engage in small talk with each applicant. The robot asks critical questions succinctly with no emotion, no bias and no preconceived notions. Every question is asked in the same order, with no change in voice inflection or tone. Once each interview is over, the hiring manager and HR department have a complete transcript of the conversation, along with identical datasets for all candidates that can be used to determine which applicant is the best fit.\n\nScience fiction? No way. Technology developers are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to flip the job interview process on its head, and companies are already adopting robotics to help take bias out of recruiting.\n\nReleased in May, the Tengai HR robot is an \"unbiased social job interview robot that performs structured, competency-based interviews with anonymous candidates, focusing on soft skills and personality traits,\" says Elin Oberg Martenzon, chief executive officer at Sweden-based Tengai Unbiased.\n\nThe Tengai robot enables employers to make hiring decisions based on facts, not gut feeling, she says. \"Every job applicant gets fair treatment, and their application and interview process is not affected by unconscious bias or the recruiter's mood that day. Applicants also get to prove their soft skills and personality traits in an objective environment where they can feel calm and secure—which, from research, has shown to bring higher quality to the outcome.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA New Era in Hiring\n\nTengai is one of many emerging corporate recruiting tools that are changing the face of the hiring process.\n\nFrom relying on predictive analytics and chatbots to using enhanced candidate vetting strategies—and myriad other up-and-coming trends—the recruiting industry is shedding old habits and trying some potentially game-changing new approaches as a younger, tech-driven generation of workers and managers slides into the driver's seat.\n\nNew corporate recruitment solutions come at a time when a percolating economy and robust job market are placing more pressure on HR recruitment efforts.\n\n\"Employers across all industries are feeling the effects of an extremely tight labor market,\" says Chris Beatty, a sales executive at People First, based in Reston, Va., which provides human capital management systems. \"The U.S. unemployment rate remains low, further emphasizing the shortage of talent and skills.\"\n\nChanging demographics also are at play.\n\n\"With five generations in today's workforce, employers need to ensure not only that they're managing and training employees in manners that represent each generation's values and communication styles, but also that they're recruiting with those in mind,\" Beatty says. \"Due to the increased use of technology, recruiting has seen many challenges and changes in recent years.\"\n\n\n\nFive Emerging Trends\n\nIn facing these challenges, many recruiters are shifting gears and investigating five talent acquisition and retention strategies that will provide the most impact:\n\n\n\n1. Predictive Analytics\n\n\"Analytics assist an employer in analyzing current workers and top performers and predicting which candidates may translate into high-performing employees,\" says Beth Zoller, J.D., legal editor at Brightmine™ HR & Compliance Centre, an employment law and regulations company in New Providence, N.J.\n\nZoller says that with predictive analytics, employers can move beyond basic measures, such as time-to-fill and cost-per-hire, and review more-advanced data. For instance, they can track retention rates and success indicators for top performers and apply this data to hiring decisions. Predictive analytics also can help identify which hiring sources provide the best results and can measure the effectiveness of diversity hiring efforts, albeit at a cost.\n\nJessica Adams, vice president of human resources and recruiting at Brad's Deals, a discount website based in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, speaks from experience when she says \"establishing predictive analytics can be expensive and requires internal support. But if you're looking to scale and recruit in a big way, investing in it is imperative.\n\n\"It informs your candidate interviews and can surface areas of concern,\" she continues, \"so that you can streamline interviews to make the most out of the time spent with [candidates].\"\n\nAdams also notes that predictive analytics is increasingly being incorporated into the tools talent managers are using on a regular basis.\n\n\"For example, our applicant tracking system [ATS] includes predictive analytics and machine learning to provide insight into such factors as employee tenure and career growth, in addition to external factors like pipeline size and forecasting start dates,\" she says. \"This data helps our team better understand hiring needs [and] the recruiting life cycle and helps to successfully onboard candidates.\"\n\nSpecifically with regard to recruiting, Adams says, the ATS ranking system helps ensure that busy hiring managers and recruiters can focus their limited time on reviewing candidates with the strongest potential.\n\nPredictive analytics can take human resources into a burgeoning array of strategic directions. At Suisse Bank, for example, HR analysts use data algorithms to figure out which employees are likely to quit and why.\n\nThe investment banking giant puts the information to good use. Managers are given the aggregate data so that they can focus retention efforts on quality staffers who are likely flight risks. The company reported a stronger retention rate after the data-analysis campaign launched.\n\n\n\n2. Chatbots\n\nMore HR managers are turning to high-end, customized chatbots to make recruiting more efficient and to produce better outcomes.\n\n\"The rapid growth of instant messaging and automated chatbots that can integrate into existing ATSs and HRISs [human resource information systems] will allow recruiting and HR teams to start scaling workflow processes,\" says Jonathan Duarte, founder of GoJobs, an online job board based in San Francisco.\n\nFor instance, interview scheduling is often one of the most time-consuming yet critical tasks, Duarte says. It has traditionally involved multiple phone calls and e-mails between multiple people—a system that requires individualized human support and isn't scalable. \"Now, however, chatbots can be connected to a recruiter's calendar, knowing what times are available,\" he says. \"Then recruiters can simply send a text message asking a candidate to respond if they're interested in setting up an interview.\"\n\nIt doesn't end there, Duarte adds. \"The chatbot then provides available times and dates, and candidates can choose times that work with their schedule. This solution saves all parties time and frustration and allows recruiting teams to scale their processes.\"\n\nChatbot-based recruiting solutions are gaining favor among recruiters and hiring managers even as the unstructured human side of recruiting can be difficult to squeeze into a technology-based system.\n\n\"Combining technology with unstructured [or semi-structured] corporate processes has tended to result in unhappy marriages,\" says Alan Majer, chief executive officer and founder of Good Robot, a Toronto-based tech firm that specializes in research, prototyping and new product development. \"In fact, I'd suggest that many technologies which might be used to improve HR's efficiency or outcomes would probably be doomed to failure.\"\n\nBut chatbots are different, Majer says.\n\n\"A well-built chatbot starts with the reality that conversations are nonlinear,\" he explains. \"Instead of force-fitting people into predefined categories, it allows for a nonlinear flow that captures the unstructured data that IT systems have struggled to accommodate but that's so valuable to the process of identifying and screening the right candidates or for connecting people to the right information at the right time.\n\n\"It's finally a tech tool flexible enough to accommodate people, instead of rigidly forcing humans to conform to it,\" Majer continues. \"That's the reason it will succeed where many other tech systems have failed.\"\n\nEconomically, chatbots already seem to be a money-saver for HR teams. IBM, for example, and its Watson chatbot, which engages with job applicants daily and significantly eases the HR workload, helped save Big Blue $107 million in 2017 alone.\n\nDelia Ortiz, SHRM-CP, IBM talent acquisition manager,discusses recruiting overlooked candidates.\n\n3. Enhanced Vetting\n\nDelving more extensively into a job candidate's background is a short-term task that can pay long-term dividends.\n\n\"Recruitment processes differ for every organization depending on size and budget, but for a small or midsize enterprise like us, we have a three-stage interview process,\" says Jessica Salter, human resources adviser and talent manager at London-based Best Response Media, a website developer. \"This may seem excessive, but when we hire, we want to hire right.\"\n\nFirst, HR screens every candidate on a phone or video call. This is important for two reasons, she says: to test communication skills and \"to paint a vivid picture of the job role and our organization.\"\n\nCandidates who pass the initial screening receive a test from Salter's team that's relevant to the job role, like a design task, a writing assignment or an analysis of a client marketing campaign.\n\n\"The final stage will be to meet the rest of the team,\" she says. The managing director or hiring manager will invite the candidate either to the company's offices or to a video call, depending on whether the job is remote.\n\n\"This process can take anywhere from three weeks to a month,\" Salter says, \"but, again, we're prepared to wait for the right candidate.\n\n\"Every employee must share our company values and understand the company culture,\" she adds. \"Our retention rates have significantly increased with this process, and our voluntary turnover has decreased.\"\n\nThe methods hiring managers are using to better evaluate candidates are changing fast, too.\n\nTheresa Santoro, director of human resources and operations at Actualize Consulting, an engineering and technology services firm based in Washington, D.C., encourages applicants to move away from resumes to bios, or profiles, that are easily customized.\n\n\"This will better transcribe their skill sets to align with [open] positions and also save employers time in reviewing applicants,\" she says.\n\nAs for its own hiring practices, Actualize uses behavior assessment tools to identify personality traits and how candidates may fit in with existing teams. \"We're also using video applications,\" Santoro says, \"which saves time in the interview process and allows us to evaluate soft skills we might miss with standard applications.\"\n\n\n\n4. Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence is growing across the business landscape, with recruiting and human resource practices increasingly being affected.\n\nCase in point: An online survey of 484 human resource professionals by HR Research Institute and sponsored by Oracle found that in two years, 77 percent of HR organizations will be using AI for talent acquisition to some extent, says Vinita Venkatesh, vice president of marketing at the San Francisco-based Mya Systems, which offers a AI-powered recruiting platform that converses with job applicants.\n\n\"While the human touch point is important, automation will soon reign,\" she says.\n\nAs an example, Venkatesh points to L'Oreal, which uses AI to help screen more than 1 million applicants for its 15,000 jobs a year. \"Results have been quite positive,\" she says.\n\nL'Oreal has indicated, for example, that it used artificial intelligence tools to screen 12,000 applicants for an internship program with 80 spots. The deployment of AI saved 200 recruiting hours and enabled L'Oreal to hire the most diverse group of interns to date, Venkatesh notes.\n\nAllie Jeanty, director of development and analytics at Atrium Staffing in New York City, says, \"AI is creating major efficiencies for recruiters and offering an improved candidate experience.\" Machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), the ability of computers to understand and respond to human language, are examples of AI technologies that are \"hot\" in the recruitment space right now, she notes.\n\n\"With applicant databases that grow in volume every day, mining for top talent and being able to efficiently and promptly respond to top talent has gotten more challenging,\" she says.\n\nJeanty also points to two key areas where AI can be a game changer for staffing and recruiting professionals:\n\nAlgorithms. \"Trained algorithms are able to surface candidates for a particular job in seconds, versus the hours that a recruiter might spend looking for that same talent,\" she says. \"This extra time given back to the recruiter allows them to spend more time focusing on the needs of the client and getting to know their candidates on a deeper level.\"\n\nMatching and response. \"Using matching technology and NLP, recruiters can identify and respond to top candidates more quickly than ever before,\" Jeanty adds, \"so that more candidates are having quality interaction with recruiters.\"\n\n\n\n5. Texting\n\nYes, mobile texting has been around for a while, but as a recruitment communications tool? Not so much.\n\nThat's all changing—and fast—as sending and receiving text messages is the most common form of communication for many Americans under age 50, according to Gallup.\n\n\"With the number of people using [mobile] phones worldwide expected to surpass 5 billion by 2019, human resource professionals are frequently adding texting into their recruiting strategy,\" says Aman Brar, CEO of Jobvite, which provides recruiting software, based in Indianapolis.\n\nJobvite recently acquired Canvas, an enterprise-grade, text-based recruiting platform used by companies from startups to Fortune 500 businesses. Canvas uses a chatbot to gather initial information about candidates before human recruiters take over, creating a hiring process that's both faster and more convenient for everyone, Brar says.\n\nAdvanced text, chatbot and AI technology drive engagement throughout the hiring process. That allows recruiters to innovate by leveraging machine learning to empower highly scalable human-to-human conversations and automate top-of-funnel candidate screening.\n\n\"Texting with multiple people at once allows recruiters to juggle 20 to 30 conversations on a text dashboard at the same time,\" Brar says. \"Ninety percent of recruiters who have implemented texting in their recruitment have found that using texting speeds up the process considerably.\"\n\nThe average text response time is about 90 seconds. Additionally, a job candidate can be screened in just 4.4 minutes after a text engagement, and a hiring manager who typically conducts four to six phone screens per day can reach 10 times that volume using text-based recruiting.\n\nAccording to Cliff Holsenbeck, senior director of product management at iconectiv, a division of Ericsson in Orlando, Fla., companies such as Target and McDonald's are using text-based technology called \"short codes\" to land top job candidates.\n\n\"Short codes are unique, personalized five-to-six-digit numbers that make text-messaging campaigns possible,\" he says. \"They enable instant outreach for recruitment and allow recruiters to increase the list of potential candidates in a way that's familiar to consumers. Short codes are especially useful for job recruitment in industries that experience a high turnover rate, like seasonal and customer service positions.\"\n\nSince consumers must opt in, messages sent via short codes are uniquely effective in their ability to hit their target audience with remarkable consistency.\n\n\"SMS messages have a 98 percent open rate, are read within three minutes or less, and have a response rate three times higher than e-mail,\" Holsenbeck adds. \"Unlike e-mail marketing efforts, which often end up filtered into a junk or spam folder, mobile marketing initiatives have a proven track record of success.\"\n\nCompanies are also beginning to roll out voice-activated mobile apps that make it easier for people to apply for jobs.\n\nMcDonald's, for example, recently launched an Apply Thru app for Alexa and Google devices that leverages voice-search technology to let prospective employees easily apply for a position over the phone. Once the applicant finishes the call, McDonald's can text the caller back to finish the application and set the stage for future engagement.\n\nBrian O'Connell is a Bucks County, Pa.-based freelance business writer.\n\nExplore Further\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "full_text": "​Starting an HR analytics initiative from scratch can be daunting. But it can be done successfully without a big investment in analytics software or HR staff, according to Lydia Wu, head of talent analytics for Panasonic USA in New York City.\n\nSpeaking at the recent HR Technology Conference & Exposition, Wu detailed how she was able to build and then scale an analytics program with limited resources\n\nWu, who works in an HR shared services function at Panasonic, launched the project on her own. \"It was me, myself and I for the first three months, and then we eventually hired an analyst,\" she said. \"Over time we morphed into a group of four that now focuses on different phases of the HR analytics cycle.\"\n\nWu initially sought to build Panasonic's HR analytics capabilities in three core areas:\n\nBasic data literacy. \"We needed to be more conversant with our current business data rather than only with historical experiences of anecdotes,\" she said.Improved HR data quality. Instead of attempting to conduct a full data cleansing or implement new analytics software from vendors, Wu decided to start small. \"We got scrappy with it and used the resources we had in front of us to get started.\"Increased stakeholder understanding and adoption. Wu wanted to break through a perception that HR wasn't \"data smart\" and only served in an administrative and compliance capacity. \"It had been difficult for us in the past to even produce accurate head-count numbers,\" she said.\n\n[SHRM members-only platform: SHRM Connect]\n\nMeasuring the Employee Experience\n\nWu said one of her first goals was to create a better measure of the employee experience at Panasonic USA. \"We wanted to stitch together different datasets to paint a more accurate picture,\" she said. \"Some of the metrics involved in that were turnover rates, length of tenure and gender percentages in the workforce.\"\n\nThat meant gathering and analyzing more data on the job-candidate experience and employee engagement, onboarding experiences, exit interviews and more. \"We needed to get a better sense of the moments in employees' lives that really matter to them,\" she said, \"so we could better direct HR and business resources to those events\" with the ultimate goal of improving employee engagement and retention.\n\nAnalytics on a Shoestring\n\nWhat resulted from that effort was the creation of embedded talent analytics, which are now a core part of the group's strategic HR planning activities. Those analytics include predictive forecasts, historical insights and market research to help guide line leaders' decisions around talent.\n\nWu accomplished her initial goals without having to invest in new HR analytics software. \"We've relied on Excel, PowerPoint and tools our IT group gave us for free for a good portion of the 18 months we've been doing this,\" she said. \"I'm an advocate of using what's available to you, proving the case and then working on getting additional funding. I think people need to overcome the perception that you need a large team and a big tool set of analytics software to get started.\"\n\nAnother area where Wu focused on building her team's analytics skills was in consulting with line managers to better understand and address their key challenges.\n\n\"My philosophy is if someone comes to us with a request, and they don't think they need to sit for 30 minutes to explore that request further, chances are it's probably a reporting ask and not an analysis ask,\" she said. An analysis question—a line manager's request that Wu's group help interpret rather than just gather data—requires a deeper dive. \"It's through that kind of real engagement with stakeholders and placing ourselves in their shoes that we can figure out what the real questions or problems they're facing are,\" she said.\n\nOne of Wu's team members has expertise in industrial-organizational psychology and is especially equipped for such data analysis and consulting.\n\n\"That person's primary focus is looking at the data and coming up with the 'so what?' \" she said.  For example, if employee turnover rates are trending up, it could be a reflection of many factors, including greater market competition, more external job opportunities, a drop in employee morale or manager relations issues. Wu's team helps to sort out those variables to pinpoint real drivers of the problem.\n\nScaling an Analytics Initiative\n\nOnce her analytics initiative was off the ground and producing results, Wu sought to take it to other parts of Panasonic. The goal was to create a system that could be scaled and repeated around the organization as business units faced similar challenges.\n\n\"We have a number of subsidiary businesses at Panasonic, and we stressed it wasn't our way or the highway when implementing HR analytics,\" she said. \"We encouraged those businesses to customize our approach to their own management styles or nuances.\"\n\nTo that end, Wu's team supplied the subsidiaries with templates and best practices it had created around analytics and encouraged the units to tailor them as necessary.\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​Once regarded as \"nice to have but not critical,\" diversity and inclusion (D&I) technology has taken on new importance as the evidence mounts that demonstrates D&I's ability to improve companies' financial success.\n\nNew research shows the D&I technology vendor market is innovating and expanding as companies make pay equity, creating diverse talent pipelines, and building a fair and healthy workplace a priority for not just HR but also managers throughout the organization.\n\n[SHRM members-only toolkit: Managing Pay Equity]\n\nIn a study conducted in February and updated in July, the research and advisory firms RedThread Research and Mercer collaborated to analyze the quickly growing D&I technology market and capture insights from vendors and HR leaders who are using technology to manage diversity in more strategic and efficient ways. A total of 121 D&I vendors were included in the study, said Stacia Garr, co-founder and principal analyst of RedThread Research, and new vendors arrive on the scene with regularity.\n\nWhile maintaining compliance remains a concern for HR leaders looking to invest in D&I technologies, experts say it's now just one of many buying criteria rather than the dominant one.\n\n\"I'm seeing less focus on compliance with D&I technology, with it now being considered table stakes,\" said Chris Havrilla, vice president of HR technology and solution provider strategy with Bersin, Deloitte Consulting. \"It's now as much about talent acquisition and people analytics as it is about pure compliance. There's more of a focus on the business criticality of workforce diversity and inclusion today.\"\n\nMost vendors in the RedThread-Mercer study were focused on talent acquisition (43 percent) and analytics (26 percent), with fewer focused on development and advancement (19 percent) or engagement and retention (12 percent.) While technology and software alone can't solve inequities or discrimination in the workplace, HR professionals are finding that modern tools can bring those issues to the attention of business leaders in more impactful and efficient ways, experts say.\n\n\"Diversity and inclusion has long been owned by HR, but it's reached an inflection point where it's receiving increased attention from business leaders beyond HR, and thus more budget dollars,\" said Carole Jackson, senior principal of research and products for D&I at Mercer.\n\nThe growth in D&I technology solutions is being fueled by companies moving beyond strategies that focus on supporting individuals to those that support entire organizations.\n\n\"Rather than just providing one-off training of individual managers in unconscious bias or supporting individuals through employee resource groups, there's a shift to a more systematic organizational focus and a desire to create scalable change around D&I, which the right technology can help drive,\" Jackson said.\n\nThe capabilities of modern technology can help leaders more easily spot trends in D&I practices before they become legal or bottom-line issues, experts say. \"There's a new focus on creating transparency around pay equity analytics, removing unconscious bias from hiring and having a diverse workforce,\" Garr said. \"Rather than shying away from pursuing that data, it's now expected that companies dig deeper to find the real story about D&I practices in their companies.\"\n\nFocus on Talent Acquisition\n\nThe D&I technology market is growing at a rapid pace, the Red Thread-Mercer study found, with nearly 60 percent of vendors four years or younger experiencing more than 100 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Experts say HR leaders who are purchasing systems in this developing technology category need to ask the right questions to ensure vendors deliver on what they promise.\n\n\"It's important to be laser-focused on what you're trying to achieve with D&I technology because there can be a lot of marketing-speak from vendors out there,\" Garr said, especially around functionalities like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nMost D&I vendors in the talent acquisition category are focused on helping companies reduce unconscious bias in hiring and create more diverse candidate pools. Technologies in that category were almost evenly split between those targeting candidate sourcing and selection in the RedThread-Mercer study.\n\nSome systems focus on targeting job ads to specific candidates who may be under-represented or on offering enhanced search capabilities that allow recruiters to search for candidates by specific attributes, such as gender or background/ethnicity. Another group of vendors specialize in delivering \"blind\" resumes or profiles by removing names, photos, nationality, and other details that can be used to identify people as well as in creating blind assessments or reducing bias in background checking processes.\n\nGarr said her recent research shows new vendors continue to emerge in this category. Two examples are Incluzion, a platform for companies to recruit, hire and pay diverse gig talent and the Mom Source Network, which uses virtual networks to connect moms looking to return to the workforce with women who are currently working.\n\nAnalytics, Development and Engagement\n\nThe RedThread-Mercer study also found that vendors and HR leaders are focusing on three other categories of D&I technology:\n\nAnalytics. The study divided D&I analytics into three types of activities—D&I analysis and monitoring (including pay equity analysis), employee resource group (ERG) management and analysis, and D&I business case analysis.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages technology can bring to D&I initiatives is improved visibility of data, Jackson said. \"Companies typically have relied on a lot of ad hoc analysis to understand where they stand on diversity,\" she said. \"The tools in modern technology make that data more visible and easily analyzed not just for HR leaders or top executives but also for line managers who are increasingly being held accountable for D&I performance as well.\"\n\nThe desire for more analytics goes beyond the need to make a business case for diversity and inclusion, Garr wrote in her research report. Leaders want analytics to help them prioritize D&I areas for intervention and action as they often struggle to identify key areas to improve.\n\nDevelopment and advancement, or processes used to develop and promote employees, including learning and development and mentorship or career management. Garr said her latest research shows more vendors emerging in the mentoring and career development space, with two examples being Everwise and InstaViser.\n\n\"But our research shows this area hasn't yet received as much attention from vendors as talent acquisition and people analytics, even though it can be even more impactful on D&I than those two areas,\" Garr said.\n\nEngagement and retention. These technologies help capture how employees perceive an organization, help companies better understand and analyze diverse groups' work experiences, and show companies how diverse employees are spoken to and how they can speak to the organization.\n\nOther vendors in this category are focused on creating improved systems for reporting misconduct, sexual harassment or discrimination in the workplace.\n\nThe ultimate goal of improving in areas like removing unconscious bias in hiring, reporting harassment and creating diverse talent pipelines should be enhanced employee engagement and retention, Garr said. \"Yet only 12 percent of vendors in the study said they were directly focused on those two things.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​Company executives are eager to supercharge their decision-making process with technology that helps them process massive amounts of data. Keeping a strong focus on company values and ethics when gathering, using and disseminating that data can be critical to the organization's success.\n\nAs companies embrace new tools that drive efficiency, cut costs and improve the delivery of products and services to customers, human resources managers recognize that the growing amount of sensitive data available requires the data to be collected, managed and used in a way that is consistent with company values and adheres to legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nAdditionally, software that closely monitors employees' daily activities challenges HR managers who are trying to build a good employee experience.\n\nBringing Values to Work\n\nExamples of how new technology can perpetuate bias and violate privacy are increasing. When Amazon wanted to automate its recruiting system, it built a machine-learning computer model from resumes mostly from men that were submitted to the company over a 10-year period. The system taught itself to downgrade female candidates and prefer male candidates. It was therefore scrapped and never used companywide. A valuable lesson was learned: Building a machine-learning algorithm for recruiting works best when gender-neutral data is used.\n\nPrivacy advocates are wary of facial recognition technology that law enforcement organizations say helps them track people suspected of serious crimes. Studies reveal that racial and gender bias plagues facial recognition technology.\n\nHR managers need only look at the $5 billion settlement that Facebook has to pay to the Federal Trade Commission for the social media company's mishandling of massive troves of personal data to know that the inappropriate collection and use of customer information can be costly, both financially and to a company's reputation.\n\n[SHRM members-only toolkit: Introduction to the Human Resources Discipline of Ethics]\n\nArtificial intelligence, biometrics, and tools that monitor employee behavior at work and consumer activities online result in volumes of personalized data being introduced into an organization's workflows, often without a clear regulatory framework to guide companies on how they should handle that data, said Anjali Lai, senior analyst at Forrester Research.\n\n\"The continued rise of emerging technologies at the workplace has put ethics to the test,\" Lai said. \"The challenge for HR managers is trying to figure out what is the potential of technology and what are all of the scenarios in which it both provides value but also destroys value.\"\n\nValues and ethics are inherently personal, she added, which makes rallying an entire organization around a value code relating to workplace technology even more challenging. In a time of record-low unemployment, as employers search high and low for new talent and struggle to retain the workers they have, 87 percent of respondents to a recent Forrester poll said they are more likely to stay with a company that shares their values.\n\n\"You have to account for an incredibly diverse set of ethical codes,\" Lai said. \"Finding that alignment between the shared values in the company among employees and management and those among consumers is a challenge in itself, but one that is necessary to be successful in the future.\"\n\nUsing Data Well and Ethically\n\nAt a growing number of companies, HR managers must figure out how to use the information gathered from software that measures how workers spend their time on the job. Tools from ActivTrak, for example, can monitor the minute-by-minute activities of employees when they surf the Internet. Teramind's software monitors employees and generates data for behavior analytics. Inevitably, many ethical questions arise with this kind of tracking.\n\nOne big issue, according to Brian Kropp, group vice president and HR practice leader at Gartner, is that employers are relying on technology to generate data on an employee and are then using that data to apply a predictive model to that employee, but the predictions are not 100 percent accurate. One question that arises: Where is the ethical line between what data is acceptable to collect about employees and what is not?\n\n\"That line is moving quickly,\" Kropp said. \"For example, we can put sensors in our employees' chairs to track how often they sit at their desk, but should we? On one level you can argue absolutely yes, because you want to know that people that are sitting there are productive. Furthermore, for health reasons, by knowing how often people are sitting down, we can make suggestions to them that they should stand up and move around and that will improve their health, which is a good thing. But should we?\" Kropp said.\n\nAs these ethical questions become increasingly important in the digital transformation age, many employees and managers will turn to HR, Kropp said. HR leaders need to create and implement policies that are transparent, and they should explain why management wants to collect data on workers and how it will help make their working lives better.\n\nAccording to Kropp, if the decision-making is left to the general counsel or the compliance division, the company will avoid risk but also miss out on the opportunity to deploy breakthrough innovations using analytics that generate valuable insight about employees. If the decision is solely managed by the IT staff, the technology will be the priority at the expense of employees' response to it, and that will create a variety of ethical violations.\n\n\"It's HR's job to manage between those two competing tensions and work with those other entities to get to the right answers that employees across the company feel comfortable with,\" Kropp said.\n\nNicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.

      "full_text": "​As organizations make investments to better manage the influx of people data, HR technology offers advanced capabilities, moving analytics activities from dedicated specialists to the greater workforce.\n\nOver the last year, people analytics has risen as a key priority for over 80 percent of organizations, but less than 30 percent have seen an impact of people analytics on engagement, cost reduction, and productivity. To better understand the surge in new capabilities, Deloitte Consulting LLP's Bersin™ launched a market study. Some interesting capability trends emerged in our research:\n\nNontraditional data sources. We have spoken to different providers that use e-mail metadata to develop baselines for workplace culture, based on the frequency and flow of communication across teams and networks. Others use natural language processing to draw themes from worker comments on social and professional networking sites to identify strengths and opportunities. This data can be used to identify workers who are more likely to be successful, address engagement issues while they are still easily manageable or bolster the collaboration of different groups. Additional insights can be derived from accessing data from operational business systems, like financial planning systems, customer satisfaction databases, or sales management tools. Our High-Impact People Analytics research revealed that high-performing people analytics teams collect data from an average of seven channels, as compared to only three for their low-performing counterparts.\n\nAdvanced data integration. Various data sources are most valuable when they are integrated with each other, to determine relationships between activities and results. There are quite a few solutions on the market that are now making it easy to combine disparate sources of data. Most providers combine the traditional sources of data (e.g., HR operational data from HCMS and ATS), but others are adding nontraditional data sources like assessments, communication data, social media activities and even customer satisfaction for a more holistic view of the workforce. For example, by combining data from a candidate relationship management platform and a performance management solution, employees could get feedback on their strengths and development areas even before their first day on the job. Another example could be feedback generated from an employee engagement solution combined with retention data, providing users with insight into potential reasons why an employee chose to leave even without having to conduct an exit interview. These insights can create actionable triggers for leaders to improve workplace culture.\n\nSmart organization charts. It has been fascinating to see the growth in how tools can analyze and visualize an organization chart and display much more than who reports to whom. Visualized charts and dashboards make it easier to understand priorities such as inclusion and retirement risk. It is one thing to see a bar chart of retirement risk, and another to see an org chart with over half the individuals listed as likely to retire in the next five years. These insights can trigger actions like high-potential identification and succession management to fill projected gaps.\n\nUser-based metrics and permissions. Another critical requirement for people analytics is having an actionable approach for different users--from the CEO to the individual contributor. We have seen a collection of intuitive metrics and data visualizations that make it easy for people at the individual level to take action based on data. For example, proactive notifications that remind an individual to take breaks, focus on a specific task or help find a good stopping point for their day.\n\nNetwork analytics. It is exciting to see that network analytics is starting to get broader acceptance as a general tool instead of being primarily used by I/O psychologists. Just over 40 percent of the providers in our study indicate that they offer network analytics to understand the connections and connectors in people data, with another 20 percent planning to add the capability in the near future. Beyond an analysis of the inner workings of organizations, we are seeing providers combine their network analysis capabilities with other people data use cases to help achieve business outcomes. For example, to determine connectors in organizations for change management purposes, to bolster exposure for women to male leaders, or to strengthen integration work during mergers and acquisitions.\n\nWhat does this continued growth of new features and capabilities mean for your organization?\n\nSolutions are now available to help you understand the workforce experience throughout an employee's life cycle. Determine how the different pieces fit together to build your unique ecosystem of tools and don't wait for the silver bullet of a single solution. Bersin research has indicated that mature organizations manage an ecosystem of tools to generate rich insights and complex actions for business impact, pulling together the right tools for each problem.If your organization does not have the solutions necessary or the appetite to build these capabilities, focus on the outcomes you are looking to achieve, whether they be retention, engagement or productivity. Evaluate building the capability in-house against using a third-party provider who can do people analytics as a service, supporting your team on a temporary or ongoing basis. Look for opportunities to drive additional impact beyond HR efficiencies, financial returns or cost reduction. Today, organizations need to be social enterprises, both generating profit and improving the lives of workers, customers and communities as well as solving societal issues. People analytics can provide needed insights into work, workers and the workforce to accomplish this goal.\n\nGiven that high-performing people analytics enable significantly better workforce and business outcomes, the cost of doing nothing might be too high to pass up.\n\nKathi Enderes, Ph.D., is vice president, Talent and Workforce Research Leader, Bersin™, Deloitte Consulting LLP and Matthew Shannon is senior research analyst, Solution Provider Market, Bersin™, Deloitte Consulting LLP.\n\n© 2019.

      "full_text": "​The ability to analyze and extract valuable insights from workforce data is an increasingly sought-after skill in HR. As more data is collected through new platforms and tools, HR professionals can identify where employee turnover is spiking and why, correlate hiring data with employee performance or demonstrate the influence of engagement on workforce productivity.\n\nBut adding data-analytics competency in the HR staff is a challenge. In a tight labor market, applicants with these skills are scarce—and expensive. Many HR leaders in smaller companies are forced to build those capabilities by training existing staff or borrowing experts from other functional areas, rather than recruit externally to fill those roles.\n\nA recent study report, The Age of Analytics, by McKinsey & Company details the nature of that recruiting challenge. Approximately half of executives surveyed reported greater difficulty in recruiting analytical talent than filling any other kind of role in their organization, the study found.\n\nMany HR functions face hurdles when seeking to add analytics competencies to their staffs, said Jeanne Achille, chair of the Women in HR Tech Summit at the annual HR Technology Conference & Exposition and CEO of the Devon Group.\n\n\"HR is swimming in data but often doesn't have the staff to help interpret that data in a meaningful way for the business,\" Achille said. \"In terms of recruiting for those roles, I think we're still several years out from having an established talent pool.\"\n\nGiven that challenge, what are the best ways to build data-analytics skills for HR staff who may have limited quantitative, statistical or storytelling abilities?\n\n[SHRM members-only platform: SHRM Connect]\n\nData Analytics Training Options\n\nSome HR leaders don't have the luxury of having dedicated data analysts on staff, so they turn instead to educating HR generalists in those skills or recruiting others with some social science or quantitative backgrounds, said Jake Ridgway, vice president of people with Health Union in Philadelphia.\n\nRidgway believes generalists can be taught skills such as learning to sift through data in an HR information system (HRIS) or applicant tracking system to identify trends and using visual representations to show the data. In larger organizations, dedicated HR data analysts often have responsibilities that include developing and maintaining HR analytical tools or dashboards, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of datasets, and partnering with workforce planning teams.\n\nBut Ridgway believes one of the most important skills for any data analyst to have is storytelling ability. \"You don't need to be a Python coding expert or to run SPSS regressions to add value in data analytics,\" Ridgway said. \"Having basic data literacy skills along with an ability to use Excel and PowerPoint to tell impactful stories about workforce data can go a long way.\"\n\nWhat do HR leaders and industry experts think would make a good analytics training curriculum for HR generalists? Whether delivered internally or externally through university programs or massive, open, online learning courses, that content might cover quantitative and mathematical skills, data gathering, survey design, root cause analysis, hypothesis generation and storytelling with data.\n\nJeff Mike, vice president and head of the HR research practice for Bersin, Deloitte Consulting, said HR organizations successful in building data-analytics competencies often use multidisciplinary training approaches featuring action learning projects. \"They might put a cross-functional team together with HR business partners or generalists along with data analysts borrowed from other parts of the organization who can translate their expertise to HR,\" he said.\n\nMike said smaller HR functions may not need a dedicated data analyst if they have access to one elsewhere in the company. \"But everyone in HR should be data-literate enough today to understand how people data influences business data,\" he said.\n\nSome experts believe a combination of buy and build approaches can work best. For example, an HR leader might hire a seasoned data analyst who can help train others in the function, as well as have those who complete external education programs return to train their peers.\n\n\"The more HR understands the business, the more we can use data in a way that speaks directly to the challenges line leaders have, rather than just trying to guess what those challenges are or trying to solve for problems HR thinks is interesting but others in the organization don't see as a high priority,\" Ridgway said.\n\nData Analyst or Data Scientist?\n\nThe growing demand for data analysts and data scientists has led more academic institutions to develop programs specifically for HR needs. One example is the Master of Science in human capital analytics and technology at New York University (NYU). The seven-course core curriculum features content in data analysis and automation, along with foundations of behavioral and organizational sciences.\n\nA prerequisite to the program is the \"Foundations of Analytics for Human Capital Management\" course, designed to help aspiring or new HR professionals perform data analysis, get familiar with analytics tools and develop an ability to communicate insights from data analysis to the rest of the company.\n\nRoy Altman, an HR analytics expert and former HRIS manager at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, is an instructor in the NYU program. He said understanding the distinction between data analysts and data scientists when making staffing decisions is important for HR leaders.\n\nData analysts have an ability to analyze workforce data and extract insights for line managers, in addition to other data management skills, Altman said. Data scientists have competencies in such skills as regression analysis, machine learning programming or mathematical modeling and usually hold advanced degrees.\n\n\"The bigger need in HR is usually for data analysts skilled at correlating data and translating their findings into relevant stories for line managers and executives,\" Altman said. He added that some of the capabilities data scientists provide to organizations, such as machine learning or predictive analytics, are now embedded in vendors' software tools.\n\nTeaching HR staff to look beneath the surface of workforce data is key to good training approaches, Altman said. For example, just presenting reports to executives that show general turnover or diversity metrics isn't enough.\n\n\"You might run a report that shows 50 percent of your employee population is made up of women and members of minority groups, so it appears you're doing fine in diversity,\" he said. \"But if you map the percentage of those populations at each level of the organization, it might tell a different story. The role of data analysts is to tell stories with numbers that help leaders see what's really happening in their organizations.\"\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis.",

      "full_text": "​The average HR department is awash in unprecedented amounts of data generated by its core HR information and talent management systems. But despite that wealth of data, many departments remain knowledge-poor due to a fundamental shortcoming: an inability to combine and correlate different HR datasets in ways that create improved workforce insights.\n\nAligning the right data from a performance management system and an applicant tracking system (ATS) can generate quality-of-hire metrics so that recruiters can recalibrate sourcing strategies to target candidates more likely to succeed on the job. Connecting answers on employee engagement surveys to post-survey behaviors can produce insights like whether those who said they were going to leave a company actually left.\n\nSuch analysis requires that HR pull data out of silos scattered around the organization and centralize it for side-by-side comparisons. Organizations—and industry vendors—are taking steps to make that possible by investing in the infrastructure, data warehouses and analytics tools.\n\n\"When I talk to customers, they say one of their biggest challenges is the time it takes to consolidate data from an ATS, HRIS [HR information systems], or performance or engagement system onto one platform,\" said Rajeev Behera, CEO of Reflektive, a San Francisco-based tech company. \"If you add performance metrics to almost any other HR dataset, you usually create valuable insights, but that type of correlation doesn't happen often enough in organizations,\" typically due to infrastructure constraints or a lack of data science skills in the HR function.\n\nInterest in Advanced Analytics\n\nRecent research suggests HR professionals have a growing thirst for such analytics initiatives. Deloitte's 2018 Global Human Capital Trends survey results found that 84 percent of respondents viewed people analytics as important or very important, making it the second-highest-ranked trend in the survey. More than 70 percent of respondents also reported being in the midst of major projects to analyze and integrate workforce data into their decision-making.\n\nSome industry vendors are acting on that trend by enabling new ways of correlating data on their platforms. Kronos, a Lowell, Mass.-based provider of workforce management and human capital management (HCM) technologies, lets users combine data from its time and attendance, employee scheduling, absence management, and other modules to make more-informed workforce decisions.\n\nThe platform can calculate a \"reliability\" score for employees that managers can use when deciding how to schedule work shifts. Reliability scores are devised primarily on how many times employees clocked in late and how many absences they had in the past; the score might also factor in performance reviews and whether employees have picked up shifts from co-workers in the past.\n\nThe manager of a convenience store, for example, might only have two to three people at a time working a given shift, making it essential that workers show up on time. \"That manager could review the reliability scores of workers available for the shift and predict whether they might have problems with people calling in sick or showing up late,\" said Bob DelPonte, vice president of the HCM practice group at Kronos.\n\nReliability data also can be correlated with recruiting data when making hiring decisions. \"When store managers are hiring, they might see that current employees who live within five miles of the store had higher reliability scores than those who lived 15 or 20 miles away,\" DelPonte said. \"They could factor that data into their recruiting decisions.\"\n\nDeb Wolfsen, a human resources manager with 200-employee Engineered Protection Systems in Grand Rapids, Mich., uses data correlations to track and analyze the company's recruiting initiatives and efforts to reduce turnover. Wolfsen also correlates performance data with recruiting data to analyze quality-of-hire metrics.\n\n\"We look for trends in the backgrounds of employees we've hired who have performed well,\" she said. \"For example, we've discovered people who've formerly worked at the front desks of hotels have done well in our customer-facing roles. So we do searches for applicants with similar characteristics.\"\n\nSome HR leaders also are now combining datasets to create \"quality of life\" scores for employees. Someone who hasn't taken vacation time recently or who has been working a lot of overtime could be at risk of burnout or of leaving the organization. How might that data be used in workforce decisions? When determining who should get time off when there is only one slot open on a work schedule, a manager could look for the employee with the lowest engagement score and give them the day off, which might help improve job satisfaction.\n\nMaximizing Engagement Survey Data\n\nExperts say integrating systems to combine HR data is one thing, but extracting valuable insights from those initiatives is another. The latter typically requires a certain level of data science competency. \"It's easy enough to connect an ATS to your HRIS, but what do you do with the data at that point?\" said Chris Butler, CEO of people analytics provider One Model, who formerly worked in HR analytics with SAP SuccessFactors. \"You need to look beyond the core set of data to provide additional context to help managers understand what's going on with your workforce.\"\n\nButler believes engagement surveys represent one of the biggest missed opportunities in correlating HR datasets. Data from those surveys can be connected to almost every other data point HR has about employees, he said. Some companies are hesitant to do this because they don't know how to leverage confidential survey data correctly and maintain the privacy provisions they promise to employees in data collection.\n\nVendors that administer employee engagement surveys often collect some form of employee identifier, Butler said, and with the right controls and privacy protections, organizations can confidentially link survey results to actual employee outcomes.\n\nButler said connecting engagement survey responses and post-survey behaviors can generate insights like:\n\nDid people who responded that they lack the opportunity for training actually take a training course once it was offered?How do employee rewards affect subsequent engagement scores?Did people who expressed a lack of advancement opportunities on surveys leave the company for a promotion?\n\nDave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis.\n\nNo Data",

      "full_text": "﻿\n\nIntroduction\n\n​Employers are monitoring their workers more often and using more tracking tools than ever. What's surprising is that a growing number of employees don't mind.\n\nAdvancements in technologies―including sensors, mobile devices, wireless communications, data analytics and biometrics―are rapidly expanding monitoring capabilities and reducing the cost of surveillance, and that's prompting more employers to use these tools.\n\nIn 2015, about 30 percent of large employers were monitoring employees in nontraditional ways, such as analyzing e-mail text, logging computer usage or tracking employee movements, says Brian Kropp, group vice president of HR practice for Gartner, a research and advisory firm. By 2018, that number had jumped to 46 percent, and Gartner projects it will reach well over 50 percent this year.\n\n\n\nEmployee Trust: It’s a Toss-Up\n\n\n\nDo you trust your employer to protect your data?\n\n\n\nSource: HR Metrics & Analytics Summit.\n\n​Workers aren't completely at ease with monitoring, but fewer object to it today than in the past.\n\n\"Employees are increasingly comfortable with monitoring, especially if the employer is transparent about it,\" Kropp says.\n\nIn the Gartner survey, only 10 percent of employees in 2015 were comfortable with their employer monitoring their e-mail and computer usage. By 2018, that had risen to 30 percent. If the employer explains the reasons for the monitoring, more than half of workers say they're comfortable with it.\n\n'Employees are increasingly comfortable with monitoring, especially if the employer is transparent about it.'  Brian Kropp\n\nIn another survey, workers said they generally did not mind data collection if it was relevant for concrete business goals. But they did tend to object to monitoring certain personal areas. These included private social media accounts (72 percent objected), physical movement (57 percent), personal interactions (56 percent) and biometrics (49 percent), according to a poll from the HR Metrics & Analytics Summit.\n\nDespite those reservations, some privacy advocates think the percentage of employees who accept monitoring will continue to increase. \"It's a battle that unfortunately we've mostly lost,\" says Paula Brantner, senior advisor of Workplace Fairness, a nonprofit that promotes employee rights, and president of consulting firm PB Work Solutions. \"Employees are acclimated to it. [As consumers] they've already forfeited their privacy in a lot of different ways.\" Between wearable devices such as fitness trackers, social media posts and smartphone applications, she says, \"people are already giving up data left and right.\"\n\nMeanwhile, most employers are collecting employee data faster than they can make sense of it. \"The rate of technology growth to capture this information has dramatically outpaced our ability to understand what it means,\" Kropp says. \"Most companies are just starting to get insights from the things they're monitoring, but for the most part they're not yet at the point of driving action against that.\"\n\nPrivacy Laws Not Keeping Up\n\n​Technology is also outpacing the law, creating legal gray areas. The federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 prohibits the monitoring of oral and electronic communications but provides an exception for employee e-mail and Web activity. In general, an organization can keep track of anything if it owns the equipment (including mobile phones) being monitored.\n\nHowever, there are two situations in which employee privacy is protected by law, according to Lewis Maltby, president of the human-rights advocacy group National Workrights Institute:\n\nEmployers may not record personal oral conversations. Organizations are prohibited from recording employee phone calls or in-person conversations about nonwork-related topics, even if they happen at work. But that's not a guarantee of privacy.\n\nWhat Workers Say Is Not OK to Monitor\n\nNo Data\n\nSource: HR Metrics & Analytics Summit.\n\n​\"In theory, employers that monitor employee telephone calls are required to hang up when they realize the call is personal,\" according to a paper prepared for the American Bar Association for employment attorney V. John Ella. \"In practice, this means very little, because the employee whose call is being monitored has no way to know that the employer is listening, much less if the employer hangs up.\"\n\nEmployers may not install cameras in bathrooms or changing rooms. Cameras are allowed in work areas, but companies cannot put cameras in areas where people get undressed, such as bathrooms or locker rooms.\n\nThere's no sign that federal law regarding employee monitoring will change. However, a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling could have a chilling effect on monitoring employer-provided cellphones, says Philip L. Gordon, a shareholder at Littler and co-chair of the law firm's privacy and background checks practice group. In the 2018 case of Carpenter v. United States, the court ruled that the government cannot get unrestricted access to mobile phone carriers' records on phone locations, which are tracked via cell towers. Warrantless collection of large volumes of such data violates the Fourth Amendment because it can reveal detailed information about an individual, the court said.\n\nThe ruling could be the basis for a new privacy claim that could be problematic for companies, says Gordon, who represents employers. \"The court has essentially said that an individual's privacy can be violated even when the information is not owned by the individual.\" That could create a legal risk for employers that track the mobile phones of employees who don't want them to.\n\nAt the state level, laws vary significantly, mostly over whether employee consent is required. A few states have passed laws to govern new types of monitoring. California, Missouri and North Dakota prohibit the use of microchips, for example. Illinois and Washington have laws protecting biometric data.\n\nThe Illinois law, called the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), has prompted a wave more than 100 class-action lawsuits, according to Gordon. The statute requires companies to provide notice and obtain consent before collecting biometric data. Although the law has been on the books since 2008, it didn't receive much attention until the Chicago Tribune ran a story about a BIPA lawsuit against an employer, Gordon says. \"That opened up the floodgates\" of new suits, he says.\n\nOne case, Rosenbach v. Six Flags Entertainment Corp., made it to the Illinois Supreme Court. The plaintiff alleged that Six Flags failed to provide notice and obtain consent when it required her son to have his thumb scanned to gain access to the theme park. At issue is whether an individual is entitled to monetary damages when the only \"injury\" alleged is a violation of BIPA's notice and consent requirements. The court ruled earlier this year that an individual does not need to suffer an actual injury or adverse effect to seek damages. This ruling could mean that employers will see even more BIPA lawsuits, Gordon says.\n\nWhat Workers Say Is OK to Monitor\n\n\n\nSource: HR Metrics & Analytics Summit.\n\nFor Their Own Good?\n\n​Companies are collecting and analyzing data for many reasons, according to the HR Metrics & Analytics Summit survey. These include improving employee performance, retention, engagement, recruitment and culture.\n\nSome forms of monitoring are beneficial to workers as well as the organizations that employ them. Belts that monitor the stress on warehouse workers' backs, for example, can help them avoid injury. And by analyzing staffers' online calendars, employers might be able to tell when employees are becoming overwhelmed and thus are in danger of burning out or quitting. Supervisors can then encourage those workers to take time off.\n\nSociometric badges, which track and record employee movements, face-to-face interactions, speech patterns, vocal intonations and postures, can provide insights on leadership skills for workers and employers, Kropp notes. For example, research shows that \"it matters less what leaders say and more how they say it,\" he explains. \"So, two leaders can say the exact same things, but the one that has a better tone of voice, who says it with more confidence, is perceived as being more effective.\"\n\n\n\n​In the age of \"big data,\" however, some employees worry that they won't know what data is being collected, how it's being analyzed and used, and whether it's being protected. In the HR Metrics & Analytics Summit survey, a large majority of employees reported concern over these issues. And almost half said they did not trust their employers to protect their information. Among their worries:\n\nInsecure software.Incompetent IT departments.Previously misplaced data.A lack of transparency about how data is being protected.\n\nParticularly problematic are monitoring programs related to wellness and productivity, says Ifeoma Ajunwa, a Cornell University professor who studies the intersection of law and technology in the workplace. Wellness programs and productivity apps are often promoted by employers as beneficial to workers: Who doesn't want to be healthier and more productive? But they can be overly invasive, Ajunwa says, which is why she believes federal law needs to be updated to better protect employee privacy rights.\n\n'Companies could sell [employee data] to advertisers or to drug development companies without the employee’s knowledge and permission. There’s no law that says they can’t.'  Ifeoma Ajunwa\n\nEven though employee participation in wellness programs may be optional, people usually don't look closely at the terms to which they're agreeing, Ajunwa says. Just as consumers didn't realize how much data social media companies collected, \"most workers are simply not aware of how much they're being tracked and monitored,\" she says. \"And this surveillance is currently allowed by law.\"\n\nShe has also found that some third-party wellness program providers are selling employee health data.\n\n\"Most employees don't question what's happening with their data,\" she says. \"These companies could sell it to advertisers or to drug development companies without the employee's knowledge and permission. There's no law that says they can't.\"\n\nWhat Companies Are Monitoring\n\nPercentage of organizations collecting each type of data.\n\n\n\nSource: Gartner.\n\nWhose Data Is It?\n\n​Then there's the question of who owns employee data. In a workers' compensation claim, for example, does a worker get access to the information collected by a back-monitoring belt?\n\nFurther, who's liable for decisions made based on an analysis of data collected? For example, when an algorithm crunches data to make a hiring decision, Kropp asks, who gets sued if some type of discrimination is alleged? \"Is the employer who relied on the vendor and its algorithms the culpable party? Or is it the vendor that came up with the algorithm that leads the company to make the actual decision? Legally right now, it is unclear.\"\n\nBeyond the legal quandaries are thorny ethical ones. To what extent should companies act on the analysis of employee data?\n\n​Kropp knows of a bank that looks at the financial records of workers who have personal accounts with the bank, then targets certain employees with advice on how to improve their finances. Part of the reasoning is that employees in difficult financial situations may be more likely to commit fraud.\n\nDoes that cross the line? \"That's a philosophical question executives need to wrap their arms around,\" he says. \"They need to figure out what are they comfortable with and what are they not comfortable with.\"\n\nJust as it took Facebook scandals to make consumers more aware of who was using their data and how, Kropp believes that there will be incidents in which a company has collected employee data and \"done something terrible with it.\" But he doesn't think that will end the practice. The potential of data collection is too great.\n\n\"We'll make a lot of mistakes along the way, but there's a steady march in one direction: The technology will only get better. Our ability to garner insights from the technology and our knowledge of how to act on these insights will only get sharper,\" he says.\n\nTam Harbert is a freelance technology and business reporter based in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nExplore Further\n\n​SHRM provides resources to help companies manage their monitoring and surveillance policies and protect workers' privacy.\n\nSHRM Toolkit: Managing Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance Read about the employee-relations impact and legal consequences of workplace monitoring, with recommendations for establishing a companywide policy.\n\nRecording Conversations in the Workplace Employers will want to ensure that any no-recording policy does not interfere with employees’ rights to engage in protected concerted activity.\n\nTelephone Monitoring Policy A sample policy on company practices regarding telephone monitoring of employees’ calls when using company resources.\n\nPolicy Acknowledgment Form A sample workplace monitoring and surveillance employee acknowledgment form.\n\n",

      "full_text": "​A sophisticated array of technologies has emerged to meet employers' and remote employees' needs for secure, productive ways to get work done.\n\nIn addition to videoconferencing programs, file-sharing platforms, and project management and time-tracking tools, new adaptive analytics and secure data-access technologies are helping employees who work from home, coworking spaces or other locations outside the office.\n\nZachary Chertok, lead human capital management research analyst at the Aberdeen Group, sees analytics and secure data access as key developments supporting remote work.\n\nOnly five years ago, he said, many remote workers started each day with the time-consuming \"prework\" of prioritizing their daily tasks—decisions often disconnected from whatever was happening at the main office. With adaptive analytics, companies input contract data so that remote employees can log in to a system that has arranged accounts and tasks for them. Artificial intelligence and advanced analytics enable field employees to access the corporate work environment as if they were in the office.\n\n\"[Advanced analytics] are basically able to prioritize my workload for me, day in and day out,\" Chertok said.\n\nAt the same time, secure data access—including virtual private networks, electronic signing, locked PDFs, \"read\" time stamps and secure messaging—is \"making management more comfortable with the remote work environment,\" he said.\n\nHow much employers use remote work varies. Some let employees work at home a day or two a week, and others operate with entirely distributed, or remote, staffs.\n\nTravel-heavy industries, such as consulting, advising, field sales and onsite service delivery, depend on these tools to get work done and manage their remote workforce, Chertok said.\n\n\"Where for some industries this relationship might be intuitive, modern resources for remote management are bridging the gap between the in-office experience and the remote workplace, particularly for operational staff. … Today's remote work environment is proving productive even in collaboration-based industries,\" he added, noting that in computer science, health care management and product engineering, groups can now collaborate as if in person even when not physically together.\n\nGallup found in 2016 that more employees were spending more time working away from the office:\n\n43 percent of U.S. employees worked remotely at least some of the time in 2016, compared with 39 percent in 2012.31 percent of workers spent most of their work time offsite in 2016, compared with 24 percent in 2012. In addition, Gallup found that 37 percent would change to a job that allowed them to work remotely at least part time.\n\n\"You can work from anywhere and are often more productive in doing so,\" Chertok said, adding that various studies have shown that organizations are more productive and profitable when employees focus more on customers rather than internal meetings or rigid training schedules.\n\nSocial media account management software firm Buffer, remote workplace crowdsourcing site Workfrom, and remote workforce software provider Hubstaff published a 2018 report, based on data from more than 1,900 remote workers worldwide, which stated that nearly 90 percent of those who ran their own company had always planned on supporting remote work.\n\nHubstaff co-founder Dave Nevogt, whose firm's 42 employees all work remotely, sees \"huge\" benefits to a distributed workforce.\n\n\"Most importantly, you have a world of talent to choose from versus a localized area. This opens you up to getting people that are truly specialists at what they do, which in many cases can make the difference of a business' succeeding or failing,\" Nevogt told SHRM Online.\n\nA company in rural North Dakota might not have much local access to Ruby on Rails developers, Nevogt said, \"but you know that Ruby on Rails is the best technology to build your platform on. So you can start the business without the best technology or hire a remote team. In this example, it's always going to be best to hire a remote team with an in-depth knowledge of the best technology.\"\n\nNevogt sees communication, project management and time-tracking technology as the key remote-work technologies now.\n\nCommunication tools such as video and chat allow a team, regardless of location, to work together as if they're in the same office, he noted. \"In many cases, teams in the same city are finding it much more effective to use these technologies than to go into an office,\" he added.\n\nProject management tools help teams communicate while working more effectively on their own time, and help managers handle project prioritization and documentation, Nevogt said. Time-tracking tools allow companies to understand how much time various projects take, determine profitability, and pay employees and invoice clients accurately, he said.\n\nChertok thinks adaptive analytics is the top resource trend. While communication, project management and time tracking are key metrics that help companies understand if remote work is succeeding, he said agile, real-time analytics can help HR and management assess an array of factors that affect performance, including worker reliability in a remote setting.\n\n\"If we jump to the metrics without a real-time understanding of the context behind them, we will make hasty and poor decisions that will wind up casting out would-be good employees,\" he said.\n\nAdvanced analytics technology adapts to the way employees work each day and can even use employee onboarding information to personalize training and suggest career paths, Chertok explained.\n\nSecure data access, meanwhile, gives employers greater assurance that sensitive information won't leave the company without a data trail to track it, and allows management to turn secure access on and off from a dashboard, he noted.\n\n\"Secure data access is often swept under the rug in discussing the remote workforce. The truth is that remote work opportunities cannot exist without securing internally sensitive information. Especially in services industries and management-level employee classifications, the data being handled is proprietary and requires mutual trust between employees and the employer,\" Chertok said.\n\nAs the market evolves, he expects to see an increase in workflow automation and platform-as-a-service, or PAAS, which unifies data and converts it to a centralized analytics language run on one platform.\n\nRelying on five separate solutions is a headache for a remote employee, Chertok said, explaining that there's already a rise in workflow automation that brings everything under one user experience.\n\nDinah Wisenberg Brin is a freelance journalist and writer based in Philadelphia.",

      "full_text": "Nationwide unemployment rates are low and technology can help employers find the best talent in a tight market—but HR can use artificial intelligence (AI) in a number of ways beyond hiring.\n\nAI and automation could radically change the workplace and human resource management, said Alden Parker, an attorney with Fisher Phillips in Sacramento.\n\nIn the HR context, AI typically refers to data that is processed by algorithms to make decisions, he explained at the California State Council of the Society for Human Resource Management 2018 California State Legislative & HR Conference. \"Machine learning can be used to constantly improve decision-making quality.\"\n\nFor the HR function, AI is most commonly used for talent acquisition. Forty-nine percent of respondents to law firm Littler's 2018 Annual Employer Survey said they use AI and advanced data analytics for recruiting and hiring. But AI isn't limited to talent acquisition. Survey respondents are also using big data to:\n\nMake strategic and employee management decisions (31 percent).Analyze workplace policies (24 percent).Automate certain tasks that were previously done by an employee (22 percent).\n\n\"It is encouraging to see employers starting to embrace the many benefits provided by big data in helping manage their most important asset, their people,\" said Aaron Crews, Littler's chief data analytics officer in Sacramento.\n\nLitigation Strategy\n\nEmployment-related lawsuits tend to be fact-driven, which makes gathering documents and other information critical. However, only 5 percent of respondents to Littler's survey are using advanced analytics to guide their litigation strategy.\n\nEmployers may not be aware of the benefits to using analytics in this context, Crews said. \"The ability to leverage data early in a case, to tease out insights before you ever take a deposition or begin evaluating the credibility of witnesses, is revolutionary.\"\n\nHaving the ability to find key documents lets the employer see what people were actually doing at a certain time and can help build a story, he noted.\n\nImagine that a repair technician who travels to residences to work on refrigerators files a wage and hour class action claiming that technicians weren't paid for all hours worked. The complaint and subsequent depositions will reveal the workers' version of what their days looked like, but analytics can be used to verify or refute their story.\n\n\"The more information you have, the better the decision-making process you can engage in,\" Crews said.\n\nThe employer could gather GPS data from work trucks, routing instructions, communications about the technicians' assignments, invoices, and cellphone and login information. These data will paint a picture.\n\nThe data may indicate that the technicians didn't work off the clock and were appropriately compensated for all hours—then the employer has some solid evidence on its side. But if the data reveals that the workers' claims have merit, it is better to review the data and know about it on the front end before going through lengthy and costly litigation, Crews said.\n\nPay Equity\n\nData analytics can also be used to assess pay equity. Legislation in this area is changing rapidly at the state and local level. For example, at least 12 jurisdictions have passed laws prohibiting employers from asking job applicants about their prior compensation. The idea behind such laws is to stop perpetuating historic discriminatory pay practices based on gender, race and ethnicity.\n\nTechnology can be particularly helpful to monitor employee compensation for discrepancies based on protected categories, Crews said, noting that some jurisdictions with pay equity laws have a safe harbor for employers that conduct audits and attempt to eliminate gaps.\n\n[SHRM members-only toolkit: Managing Pay Equity]\n\nThere are tools available that make it easy to build a user-friendly experience and to analyze, understand and communicate data, he added. \"You no longer have to rely on just an Excel spreadsheet full of math.\"\n\nGetting a picture of what is actually happening in the organization is powerful, Crews noted. \"When advanced technology is paired with good storytelling and visualization, it empowers HR professionals to have the conversation with the compensation team, executives and other decision-makers.\"\n\nChatbots\n\nCertain technology, such as chatbots, can help employees access important information about policies and procedures from anywhere and at any time. Chatbots communicate by text and can be useful for answering common employee questions, Parker said.\n\nTwo-thirds of respondents said that they believe employees are more comfortable using chatbots than other forms of contact for transactional inquiries about paid-time-off policies, open enrollment and leaves of absence, according to a 2017 ServiceNow survey of 350 HR leaders. ServiceNow is a cloud computing company based in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nEmployers that use chatbots need to ensure that they are complying with data security, disability and other federal and state employment laws.\n\nLegal Pitfalls\n\nWhen using AI to drive human resources strategy, HR professionals must monitor systems for bias. They need to look out for disparate impact—which happens when a seemingly fair or neutral standard is actually discriminatory in practice.\n\nFor example, a recruiting tool may weed out candidates that are more than 10 miles away from the worksite. What if the neighborhoods surrounding the worksite are predominantly made up of affluent white families? This hiring criteria could have a disparate impact based on race and ethnicity.\n\nTo reduce the legal risks, Parker said HR professionals should:\n\nUnderstand the legal theories that may be used to attack employers who leverage technology.Discuss potential legal pitfalls with technology vendors when evaluating products.Consider auditing systems for disparate impact, security and other legal issues.\n\n\"Bad input will for the most part lead to disparate impact,\" he said, noting that this issue is on government enforcement agencies' radar. However, if the system is designed to disregard irrelevant factors, it could reduce biases in hiring decisions.",

      "full_text": "​Capital investment in HR data analytics is at an all-time high. But while organizations recognize the technology's power to help organizations make more-informed decisions, business leaders are also concerned about the trustworthiness of these tools.\n\nRecent research from Dutch professional-services firm KPMG indicates a significant trust gap. In the survey of 2,190 senior executives from Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, South Africa, the U.K. and the U.S., just 35 percent said they have a high level of trust in their organization's use of data and analytics. Another 40 percent said they had reservations about relying on the data and analytics they produce, and 25 percent admitted they have either limited trust or active distrust in their data and analytics. Nearly all respondents (92 percent) worry about the impact flawed data could have on their company's business and reputation.\n\nNo Data\n\n\"Executives and managers are being asked to make major decisions based on the output of an algorithm that they didn't create and don't always fully understand,\" said Thomas Erwin, global head of KPMG International's Lighthouse, the firm's center of excellence for data, analytics and intelligent automation. \"As a decision-maker, you really need to have confidence that the insights you are getting are reliable and accurate, but many of these executives can't even be sure if their models are of sufficient quality to be trusted. It's an uncomfortable situation for any decision-maker to be in.\"\n\n[SHRM members-only online discussion platform: SHRM Connect]\n\nMost companies have incomplete data, said Kevin Wheeler, founder and president of the Future of Talent Institute, a San Francisco-area think tank. \"Analytics functions are new to most companies and they're trying to gain credibility, so they're analyzing anything and everything and presenting tons of data in a shoddy way. I'm not surprised a CEO looks at that and says, 'What is this?' and 'Why are you telling me this?' \"\n\nEven generally accepted metrics like the gross domestic product and national productivity measurements have very low validity, Wheeler added.\n\n\"When it comes to HR data, the important criteria include how was it gathered, how large is the dataset and how long has it been analyzed? In many cases we have to wait to find out whether or not the data are useful. We're very early in understanding which analytics are important and which aren't.\"\n\nAnother issue is placing blind trust in quantitative analytical data—which Wheeler calls \"thin data.\" The traditional source of hire metrics is a good example.\n\n\"No one really knows how to measure for source of hire,\" he said. \"It's either self-reported by the candidate or reported by a tool. But let's say I saw the job ad on Facebook and then went to a party and decided to apply. I returned home and applied through the employer's careers site. The source of hire will be logged as the careers site, but that's not true. That chain becomes really hard to measure.\"\n\nQuality of hire is another one, he said. \"There are many definitions for it—none are wrong, but neither are any universally correct. The definitions for these metrics are poor and not generally agreed upon.\"\n\nWho Is Responsible?\n\nOver half of respondents (55 percent) to the KPMG study said that the company's technology function and service providers are currently held chiefly responsible for poor business decisions based on insight from faulty data analytics. Just 33 percent said responsibility would fall on the core business, such as the CEO or CHRO or functional departments. Sixty-two percent said IT should hold responsibility for poor analytics-led business decisions.\n\n\"The leaders' impulse is to absolve the core business for decisions made with machines,\" Erwin said. \"This impulse is understandable given technology's legacy as a support service, the difficulty of assessing the trustworthiness of analytics, and the tendency to give all things technical to the 'experts.' \"\n\nBut he believes this is a mistake. \"As organizations begin to think about behavior of machines as parallel to the behavior of people, they should also consider new models of governance to support the leaps in trust that the human/machine workforce requires,\" Erwin said. \"At a fundamental level, accountability of machines must be held firmly by the CEO and functional leaders.\"\n\nWheeler believes it's a shared responsibility. \"Data analysts need to be candid and upfront about how good they believe the data are, how big the sample was, how reliable it was and how they collected it. They need to be honest about that.\"\n\nAnother issue arises when the requesters of analytics aren't sure what to ask for, he said. \"If you don't know what you want to know, you'll get faulty data. And what you want to know must be realistic. Can it even be shown by analytics?\"\n\nWheeler suggested that data analysts push back if they think the request is not fully baked, and take the time to test reliability before presenting analytics.\n\nThe Human Element\n\nUltimately, HR needs to be able to appreciate the value of \"thick data\"—thin data merged with the experience, knowledge and intuition that only humans can bring, Wheeler explained.\n\n\"The best that numbers alone can do is give us insight,\" he said. \"If you just look at it from a shallow, quantitative perspective and take action based on that, it's probably a mistake. When you intelligently consider data to augment your own decision-making, the data become very valuable. I'm a strong advocate for using hiring assessments to provide some concrete data about a candidate, but I'm not going to base my hiring decision on it. I'm still going to use my gut.\"\n\nWas this article useful?

      "full_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning seem to be all the rage in HR analytics these days. They are being touted as tools that help HR leaders predict the impact of talent decisions, forecast employee flight risk, identify high-potential employees, unearth engagement issues, recommend learning courses and more.\n\nBut with the growing popularity of AI-driven analytics comes the danger of overhype. Indeed, experts are seeing an increase in the incidence of “AI washing,” a practice where technology vendors exaggerate the role of AI in their products to woo customers. A recent report from research firm Gartner Inc., which tracks commercial trends, suggests providers across industries often apply the AI label indiscriminately to their products.\n\nThat’s why it is more important than ever that HR buyers have a strong grasp of what constitutes true AI and machine learning before investing in the tools.\n\nCase Studies\n\nAI refers to systems that can adapt their functionality without being explicitly programmed to do so based on the data they collect and usage analysis. It includes many areas of study and technologies, including voice recognition and natural-language processing.  Analysts predict that by 2020, artificial intelligence technologies will be virtually pervasive in almost every new software product and service.\n\nOne vendor with seasoned machine learning and AI tools is Ultimate Software based in Weston, Fla. Ultimate’s solutions allow customers to use “signals” hidden in their human capital management (HCM) data to predict employee turnover, for example, or to identify variables influencing employee engagement.\n\nThe vendor’s AI platform can also factor qualitative signals into retention equations to determine how employees feel toward their workplace or how fulfilling they find a job role, says Armen Berjikly, Ultimate’s senior director of strategy and workforce intelligence in San Francisco.\n\nHR tech vendor Workday has a similar tool built into its core HCM platform. With the help of an interactive dashboard, customers can understand retention risks unique to their organization, a specific department or individual job roles, says Cristina Goldt, Workday’s vice president of HCM products based in Pleasanton, Calif.\n\n[SHRM members-only toolkit: Managing Organizational Change]\n\nSimilarly, Santa Monica, Calif.-based vendor Cornerstone OnDemand has an AI system called Insights that applies predictive analytics to workforce data. The technology can uncover ways to reduce an organization’s risk of regulatory fines, suggest learning courses and help identify high-potential talent.\n\n“The machine learning is there to aid and improve existing processes and work in tandem with humans,” says Mark Goldin, Cornerstone’s chief technology officer. “With succession planning, for example, the AI helps to rate people across different dimensions to determine who might be ready for promotion in six months, a year, or more. It also suggests candidates to fill succession pipelines.\n\nBuyer Beware\n\nAlthough many organizations are attracted to AI, they could be disappointed with the results if they don’t first work on improving their own ability to evaluate, build and deploy the tools.\n\n“Vendors will say they have AI and machine learning, and many don’t,” says Helen Poitevin, a human capital management research director at Gartner. She recommends asking vendors for references of clients who have experienced quantifiable success with AI.\n\n“Ask those references if the recommendations generated by the tool were useful,” Poitevin says. “How accurate were the predictions? Did those predictions improve over time?”\n\nMore than half of the respondents to Gartner’s 2017 AI development strategies survey indicated that the lack of necessary staff skills was the top challenge to adopting AI in their organization.\n\nAlso remember that algorithms are only as good as the data sources they rely on. If certain demographic groups aren’t captured, for example, they won’t be selected by the algorithm. Or if a data set is disproportionately weighted with one kind of population sample, then bias will likely occur.\n\n“There are a lot of products out there with a limited customer base, and you want to avoid investing in AI tools where there is no feedback mechanism and no way to train algorithms to get progressively smarter and more accurate,” says Brian Sommer, founder of TechVentive, a technology consulting firm in Batavia, Ill.\n\n“A feedback mechanism allows customers to provide additional data sets and to correct some of the assumptions that an algorithm may be making by providing new data inputs,” Sommer says.\n\nMany HR vendors have introduced flight-risk analytics, for instance, but most rely on internal transactional data from the client company.\n\n“If you really want to understand a larger number of indicators for an individual’s propensity to leave a firm, you’d also want to include inputs from social media profiles, job boards, salary comparison data and more,” Sommer says.\n\nFlight-risk data is best used when it serves as input for recommendation engines driven by machine learning that can suggest next-step actions, Poitevin contends.\n\nConsider, for example, a system that flags an employee with a weakened social network in the company following layoffs or co-worker departures as being at high risk of leaving the organization. “The recommendation engine might suggest steps to help that person get re-engaged in the organization, like building out a coaching or mentoring relationship with less-experienced employees, and suggesting who specifically might be good candidates to be mentored,” Poitevin says.\n\nThat’s the kind of intelligence that can help HR professionals—and their organizations—work smarter.\n\nNo Data",

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\n​“The story of why a company is performing as it is isn’t going to come from HR data. Period. Full stop.”\n\nThat’s an odd statement from someone who makes his living studying the impact of HR and human capital metrics, among other things. But data science can be a strange business—and Alec Levenson, senior research scientist at the University of Southern California’s Center for Effective Organizations, says one of the most important things HR professionals should understand about HR data is its limitations.\n\nWhile scores of articles have been written about the potential for people analytics to transform human resources from an operational function into a strategic resource, so far HR’s fundamental hurdle has been its inability to quantify its ultimate impact.\n\n​A key to changing that, experts say, is to go beyond the HR numbers. To demonstrate how workforce measures can impact the bottom line, HR professionals must meld those metrics with business data.\n\n“Metrics essentially give us a way of qualifying the health of our organization, and, to that end, HR metrics are now different,” says Ross Sparkman, head of strategic workforce planning for Facebook in Menlo Park, Calif. “They’re measuring how the HR function is doing as a whole and also how we’re leveraging the people in the organization to maximize the performance of the company.”\n\nThat’s the goal, but the reality often falls short. “Most people use data the way drunks use the lamppost: for support rather than for illumination,” says Alexis Fink, Intel’s Portland, Ore.-based general manager of talent intelligence and analytics. HR, she believes, should focus less on responding to decisions that have been made and more on training executives “to come to you further upstream, to influence the decision.” For that to happen, HR needs to have a better grasp of how metrics and analytics work.\n\nStart with these nine steps.\n\n1. Understand the Role Metrics Play in Talent Analytics\n\n​First, you have to recognize the difference between metrics and analytics. “HR metrics are operational measures, addressing how efficient, effective and impactful an organization’s HR practices are,” Fink explains. “Talent analytics, on the other hand, focus on decision points, guiding investment decisions” that impact the workforce and related matters.\n\nEssentially, metrics use data to assess things like efficiency and performance, while analytics harness those measures to help people understand or predict how changes will affect an outcome. For example, analytics that combine information on employee performance levels and retention data may show you that, once workers reach a certain level of proficiency at their jobs, they’re prone to leave. That, in turn, can help you look for ways to address whatever dynamic is nudging those employees toward the door. You may find that your competitors offer better compensation or have better career advancement programs and opportunities.\n\nPut another way, metrics tell you what is going on, while talent analytics get at what to do about it, driven by both good data and good science. “Metrics are about getting the numbers right, and analytics are about finding answers in the data,” Fink says.\n\n​“Ultimately, metrics define what you’re shooting for. They define your objective,” says Michael Housman, workforce scientist in residence at people analytics firm hiQ Labs in San Francisco. “They shouldn’t be a moving target. If you want people to stay in their job, for example, you look at things like turnover and attrition. The goal is to know what you’re trying to improve.”\n\n2. Understand the Question First, Then Look at the Metrics\n\n​Though metrics can be used to monitor performance, most data scientists emphasize their use in gathering the intelligence needed to resolve an underlying issue or create a new strategy.\n\n“Take turnover. High is bad, low is good. But what story is it telling?” asks Jennifer Currence, SHRM-SCP, president of OnCore Management Solutions, a human resource strategy consulting company in the Tampa Bay, Fla., area. “Why is it high or low? Is it recruiting? Demographics? Who’s retiring? Is it high in just one department? Why? Is there not enough training there? If not, who’s the manager for training in that area? The initial metric gives you a start to digging down deep.”\n\nThe point is to “get past the ‘what’ and fully understand the ‘why,’ ” says Cecile Alper-Leroux, vice president of human capital management innovation for Ultimate Software in Weston, Fla. “The benefit of using metrics is that the decisions are better-informed and backed by facts—rather than hunches—and thus make key people decisions far more ‘sellable’ to the business.” That gets to the heart of the next point.\n\n3. Always Build a Business Case\n\n​It has been said, and said repeatedly, that human resources struggles for relevance because it doesn’t speak the language of business: numbers. “HR has to be able to show how its dollars impact ROI [return on investment]. It has to stop acting as a cost center,” Sparkman says. “You can’t act like your costs just happen to have a good impact.”\n\nInstead, focus on building the business case for what the department is doing. As an example, Fink talks about digging into employee departures. After calculating the exit rate, look into what might be driving workers to leave your organization. You might find that certain qualities in a manager discourage some types of employees while other characteristics deepen those same workers’ commitment to the company. Delving further may show that matching managerial styles to specific workers’ personality types will reduce turnover dramatically. From there, you can forecast how much money the organization will save in hiring and training costs.\n\n‘Ultimately, metrics define what you’re shooting for. They define your objective.’—Michael Housman, hiQ Labs\n\nNo Data\n\n“Nothing matters unless you can prove it,” says Greta Roberts, CEO of Talent Analytics Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., emphatically. “HR makes mistakes by focusing on a metric and not tying it into the business. For instance, you can’t assume higher engagement leads to less turnover. You have to demonstrate it.”\n\n[SHRM members-only online discussion platform: SHRM Connnect]\n\n4. Recognize that HR Metrics Alone Offer Limited Value\n\n​“You can’t look at metrics in isolation. They have to be looked at holistically,” according to Rishi Agarwal, San Jose, Calif.-based partner and people analytics leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. That’s why most data scientists believe HR measurements by themselves rarely provide much value to the organization as a whole.\n\n“Really, cost-to-hire should be cost-to-good-hire,” says Ben Yurchak, president of KnowClick, an analytics company in Bryn Mawr, Pa. “One’s an operational metric, and the other’s a quality metric.”\n\nA caveat: Though quality measures might get you closer to tracking real business goals, compiling them may be easier said than done. “To determine the cost of a quality hire, you need time and information from other departments,” Yurchak notes. “Cross-functional measurement is harder to do, but it connects the dots.”\n\n5. Identify the Workforce-Driven Components of Business-Driven Metrics\n\n​Here again, the process of connecting the dots should be done to solve a business problem that has already been identified.\n\nFor example, if executives find that your company’s work contains too many errors, the solution may lie in studying turnover and performance data, Roberts says. “You’re not using data to figure out the issue,” she notes. “You’re figuring out the issue and then knowing what metrics to examine to find the answer.” Is revenue down because turnover is exceptionally high and thus impacting production? Are performance and productivity down because workers have too much to do in too little time?\n\nFacebook closely monitors its number of daily active users. That information hints at whether the company is hiring the kinds of engineers who generate a positive user experience. “Whatever drives the business has to drive HR numbers,” Sparkman says. “HR should be waiting for the top-down strategy to be put in place, then strategize about how HR can help the company deliver.”\n\n​“You have to parse the business challenge to figure out where the workforce element comes in,” says Andrew Courtois, a strategic workforce planner with a California-based global technology company he asked not to be identified. “If you can do that, you can make a better case to management. Show how improving the workforce element improves what management wants to improve.” Remember, he adds, “senior leaders understand things from the cost and finance perspective. HR has to think much like the CFO thinks about ROI.”\n\n6. Learn to Ask the Right Questions\n\n​Another trick to using metrics successfully is to be curious. “We have to always ask why, why, why?” Sparkman says. When you get into that habit, you start to ask better questions and learn to challenge the answers.\n\nIf your organization’s executives decide to hire 10 people in Zimbabwe, for instance, inquire about the business reasons driving the decision and whether they’ve considered all of the skills the new hires will need to succeed in such a remote location.\n\nBy doing that, “you’re helping the managers understand how far-reaching their decisions are,” Sparkman says. “Why this location? Why these skills? Why this time frame? It helps you get more clarity.”\n\n​While you’re doing this, be sure to consider the context. As you approach each challenge, Agarwal says, use a “metrics map” as your guide:\n\nUnderstand the business strategy.Tie the business strategy to the HR strategy.Ask the critical human capital questions.Determine the measurements that will help you address the issues at hand.\n\nAs you work through the process, it’s important to have a clear understanding of individual roles, adds Chris Gagnon, senior solutions partner at global management consultant McKinsey & Co. in the New York City area. “Analytics can identify traits of success to identify who’ll succeed, especially for pivotal jobs that drive a lot of value,” he notes.\n\n7. Work Across the Organization\n\n​It’s vital to collaborate with people in other departments to get the information you need to develop meaningful measures. Given that many organizations regard the human resource department as more operational than strategic, that means being proactive. “HR’s going to have to go and get the numbers,” Fink says.\n\nIncorporating HR data into business strategy requires something of a cultural shift. “You’re changing the paradigm,” Sparkman explains. “This is a commitment, and it’s really important that HR both knows and works with others to understand this. There’s going to be a lot of education involved.”\n\nExactly how the department gets its message out depends on the size of the employer. “At smaller companies, you just start doing it,” says Cezary Kuziemski, head of HR for insurance underwriter Hamilton USA in Princeton, N.J. “Go to Finance and say, ‘Here’s what I can do for you,’ then do it. You have to speak the other’s language. You have to be humble and admit what you don’t know and ask questions. You have to come to the other function with more than thoughts, but something concrete.”\n\n​At bigger organizations, try running a pilot program with a function whose manager has an interest in data, Kuziemski suggests. The effort could be about improving sales performance or reducing turnover in IT. What’s important is that you create a case study that proves you can solve an issue in a measurable way.\n\nAlso, be ready to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. “People come to HR and ask for reports,” Fink says. “Use your answer as a Trojan horse to demonstrate the amount of information you can get from analytics. By studying the data, you’ll be able to answer questions that the business didn’t know how to ask.” For example, you might use metrics to better identify ready-to-hire candidates who can decrease cycle times to fill jobs and thus save money.\n\n8. Embrace Measurement\n\n​HR professionals often argue that much of their work is intangible and hard to measure, but there’s always a way to quantify people metrics. It just requires time, experimentation and setting your own benchmarks if published ones aren’t available. For example, you might train people in new procedures and compare the outcome with the results of previously established practices, Courtois suggests.\n\nOne thing is certain: Developing base lines can require a significant investment of time and effort. As an example, Sparkman talks about time-to-hire—how many days, weeks or months it takes to acquire top talent in a particular area. “With these numbers in place, trends can be established,” he says. “Has the time to hire increased or decreased over time? Does it vary by month, quarter or season? How do university graduation dates affect the number?”\n\n‘[I]t makes sense to go out and solicit feedback on how the business leaders perceive HR’s performance on the metric in question.’—Ross Sparkman, Facebook\n\nOnce you’ve identified such trends, “it makes sense to go out and solicit feedback on how the business’s leaders perceive HR’s performance on the metric in question,” Sparkman says. “So HR leaders could ask their clients if their top talent was being sourced fast enough to meet the demands of the business.” That information will help to establish if the base line needs to be improved and, if so, by how much.\n\n​And you may have an average cost-per-hire metric for all positions, but the real meat lies in how the number varies by role. “A clerk’s different from an engineer,” notes Andrew Mariotti, a senior researcher at the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va. “You have to look at all of the expenses involved—like ads and travel—and look at each position to figure out how large is the candidate pool and the competition.”\n\nOf course, as you examine all this data, you’ll need to decide what trade-offs to make in developing an optimal solution for your company. “Let’s say your organization enjoys a high profit per employee (PPE), but turnover is higher than industry average and long hours and lack of work/life balance are cited as primary reasons for employee dissatisfaction,” Alper-Leroux says. “If you decide to focus on improving the employee experience by adopting more-flexible policies and discouraging overtime, it’s possible your PPE will drop. The impact of this must be measured against the average cost per hire and your own corporate culture and values.”\n\n“You can measure. You just have to figure out how to do it,” Courtois says.\n\nAdmittedly, that’s easier in some cases than others. For example, linking the right type of call center employee directly to customer satisfaction is pretty straightforward. “But how do you measure lawyers, scientists and the like?” Housman asks. “It really depends on what you’re trying to do as an organization.”\n\n9. Don’t Compromise on Data Quality\n\n​Finally, always bear in mind this basic point: The intelligence you glean from analytics will only be as good as the data included in your metrics.\n\nIn his book Strategic Analytics: Advancing Strategy Execution and Organizational Effectiveness (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2015), Levenson notes, “More often than not, balanced scorecards use the ‘best available’ metrics—that is, the least worst of what is sitting around.”\n\nMetrics’ value “is about actively choosing things you track because you want to manage your business better,” he says.\n\n​To help identify what those things should be, find data that meets the “CARE” criteria created by Levenson; include only information that is:\n\nConsistent—The data underlying the metric must be measured steadily over time.\n\nAccurate—Information should be precise, with few to no errors in recording it.\n\nReliable—Your metrics must be a dependable proxy of what you’re ultimately trying to assess.\n\nEfficient—The cost of collecting the data must be minimal.\n\n“One thing people don’t realize is it’s all a system,” Fink observes. “Data has to be of high quality. We’ve invested in making sure it’s good, quick and accessible. Otherwise, it’s like building a seaside mansion without a foundation.”\n\nMark Feffer is a freelance business writer based in Philadelphia.\n\nIllustration by James Fryer for HR Magazine.\n\nWas this article useful?

      "full_text": "One of the biggest changes taking place in HR is how much the role of data is growing.\n\nData are publicly available about an organization's employment brand. Companies publicize data about diversity. And we in HR have vast amounts of data about our employees.\n\nOccupEye is used by companies worldwide to see if employees are at their desks. The system apparently uses heat and motion to reveal what percentage of time people are \"working,\" and can be used to possibly help redesign the workspace.\n\nAs SHRM Online reported, this type of data is used to help companies reduce their real estate expenses, but of course employees wonder what else the data could reveal.\n\nData analytics is a tricky trend. Bersin by Deloitte has been studying the growth of people analytics for almost a decade. In our latest research being published this fall, we found an enormous jump forward in organizations' ability to manage and understand people-related data. We also discovered an alarming step backwards. While almost 70 percent of companies in our new study are now actively \"consolidating, and integrating\" data about their people, 12 percent are operating in a \"fragmented and unintentional way.\"\n\n[SHRM members-only online discussion platform: SHRM Connect]\n\nLet me give you a hypothetical example.\n\nSuppose you have an analyst who is studying the drivers of turnover. The analyst takes a bunch of data from your HR system to compare those who leave the company with those who stay. He or she may find that people who come from certain schools, have certain managers or perhaps have certain demographic backgrounds are more likely to leave. As a result, you may jump to the conclusion that \"We should not hire from these schools\" or \"These managers are not doing their jobs well\" or \"People with these backgrounds don't fit here.\"\n\nBut you might be wrong.\n\nIt may be that turnover is high in these groups because a competitor is active nearby, or a certain reorganization took place in those teams, or a seasonal variation affected staffing. And your \"findings\" could be flawed, possibly even incorrect, because your data was poorly cleaned.\n\nMy point is that the stakes for employee data are higher than ever, and these 12 percent of companies that are \"fragmented and unintentional\" could really be putting themselves at risk. If you use data incorrectly and make the wrong hiring or promotion decisions, you could negatively impact business performance—or even worse, face a lawsuit.\n\nAs important and exciting as people analytics has become, now is the time to be vigilant. Put in place a data quality council, implement security and privacy practices, and make sure IT is your partner. Data has become important to HR. We don't want it to get away from us and possibly make our lives harder.\n\nJosh Bersin is a principal and founder of Bersin by Deloitte, Deloitte Consulting LLP, a research and advisory consulting firm in enterprise learning and talent management.\n\n\n\nAs used in this article, \"Deloitte\" means Deloitte Consulting LLP, a subsidiary of Deloitte LLP.

      "full_text": "﻿\n\nOrganizational psychologist, CEC certified coach and media personality Michael “Dr. Woody” Woodward, Ph.D., recently interviewed Sheri Feinzig, co-author of The Power of People (Pearson FT Press, 2017).\n\nWho is this book for and why did you write it?\n\nSheri Feinzig: We had two main audiences in mind: HR leaders and business executives. For both audiences, we wanted a book that was practical and easy to understand. For HR professionals, one of our goals was to help them realize that an analytical approach to HR is very much within their reach, and that by embracing analytics they will be able to bring exponentially more value to their organizations. For business executives, we wanted them to see what’s possible for their HR function, particularly for those leaders who want more from HR than they’re getting today. As one of our early reviewers, Tom Davenport, so aptly put it: “Trusting your gut on people issues turns out to be a bad idea.” Our ultimate goal is to help HR leaders have more impact on their organizations and bring more benefits to their people by adopting an analytical approach to HR.\n\nWhy does our gut often fail us as HR practitioners and hiring managers?\n\nSF: We all tend to see things through a certain lens, whether we realize it or not. Sometimes our gut is reasonably okay and sometimes it leads us astray. Why take the chance, particularly with decisions that potentially have consequences for an entire organization? I think the tendency to rely on instinct is prevalent in HR, because people-related issues have a common sense element to them. But people-related decisions in business should be handled just as systematically as any other decision – with data to support it.\n\nI’ll also say that I believe there is a place for gut instinct, and that is in forming hypotheses that can be tested with data. In the book we talk about an 8-step methodology for workforce analytics, and the first steps include framing the business question that needs to be addressed, and building hypotheses to test potential causes of business issues. Hypotheses can be informed by several sources (such as research literature and previous experiences). Gut instinct can be another source of input, but let’s be sure we test those ideas and assumptions with data.\n\nHow do you change the mindset of a non-analytic and even data-fearing HR departments to one that embraces analytics?\n\nSF: That’s a great question. In fact, we’ve included an entire chapter in the book on this very topic. What we’ve found in interviewing workforce analytics experts is that most HR departments are staffed with people who fall into one of three categories when it comes to analytics: the analytically savvy, the analytically willing, and the analytically resistant. Our guidance is to understand where the individuals within your organization fall along these categories, and customize your enablement accordingly.\n\nThe analytically savvy are those who are already comfortable with numbers and statistics, and tend to view HR through a business lens. They may have joined HR from other functions, or perhaps were formally trained in analytics as part of their education.\n\nThe analytically willing are open-minded about analytics and prepared to learn, but lack formal training and experience and therefore may be somewhat hesitant as well. For this group we recommend starting with the basics, such as clarifying what analytics is and what it isn’t, and then working with them using data and tools that are already familiar to them.\n\nThe analytically resistant are the most challenging. These are people who simply do not embrace analytics and do not see the need to bring analytics to HR. I think there’s an opportunity with this group: if you can turn the staunchest resistors into believers, you will have some really powerful champions to leverage. And the path to getting there is to understand where the resistance is coming from so you know how best to address it, and work with them on a specific problem they are facing to help make them successful through analytics.\n\nIn the era of big data and automation how do your keep HR human?\n\nSF: Keeping the “human” in HR is a fundamental principle for successful workforce analytics. We strongly believe in always keeping in mind the potential impact your analytics will have on the very people whose data you are analyzing: the workers. Analytics is based on statistical models and probability, and like any modeling it will never be 100% accurate for all cases. Analytics should be used to inform decisions, but not to replace the decision makers. And you should have solid grounding in an ethical approach to data usage: just because you ‘can’ analyze certain data does not necessarily mean you ‘should’ analyze and act on it.\n\nWhen it comes to implementing analytics in HR, where do you start and what's the best way to get a quick win?\n\nSF: When you’re getting started it’s really important to demonstrate success early on, so you can establish credibility and build support going forward. You are most likely to be successful with a project that is not overly complex, and that will deliver results relatively quickly. As a first project, try to avoid taking on something with too many dependencies and uncertainties. At the same time, you want to select a project with enough impact that it will be noticed beyond the HR function. One thing to keep in mind an easily manageable project for one team might be very challenging for another team with fewer resources or less experience. So choose a project that your team can execute relatively quickly and that will make a noticeable difference for your organization.\n\n",

      "full_text": "Leaders trying to predict their organizations’ future workforce needs must focus not only on business requirements but also on what talent is likely to be available in the relevant labor markets, experts say.\n\n“You can better identify critical skills and analyze the supply and demand for those skills by tracking and modeling data on your company and the economy at large,” says Rosemary Haefner, chief human resources officer for CareerBuilder, a human capital management firm based in Chicago. “In the long term, this helps your company minimize turnover.”\n\nThe traditional workforce planning approach is hampered by rapidly evolving skills and roles, hypercompetition for talent, and the lack of detailed and reliable external labor market data, according to Dion Love, a principal executive advisor at CEB, a business management consultancy based in Arlington, Va.\n\n“Without good data, organizations overlook labor market demand and underestimate market saturation of particular skills,” he says. “Forty percent of the S&P 100 job postings in 2015 were for just 21 roles. In this environment, it’s common to overfocus on talent supply while underestimating market saturation and the intense competition for scarce skills.”\n\nIn addition, he says, “employers are telling us they are seeing a higher time-to-fill, which leads to higher talent acquisition costs.”\n\nYou’re Doing It Wrong\n\nTypically, workforce planning begins with the business strategy and its implications for future talent needs. Leaders locate internal pipeline gaps and then determine how to fill them, Love says.\n\nBut that process can get bogged down quickly in the 21st century work world. Organizations and roles are changing so rapidly that it’s a struggle to accurately forecast skills requirements.\n\n“The average organization has undergone five enterprise changes in the last three years, and 70 percent of key people say their jobs change substantially every two to three years,” says Love, citing CEB research.\n\nEmbedding labor market context at every stage of the strategic workforce planning process will help HR better understand trends related to the creation of new roles and the evolving nature of existing ones. It also will help HR assess the sustainability of the talent supply by location and provide critical market intelligence on competitiveness and wages.\n\n“I often hear from employers that they get labor market intelligence when it’s already too late,” Love says. Being able to forecast trends gives businesses a heads-up when emerging skills are on the horizon or alternative talent pools become available. Talent market analytics also aid companies in developing realistic attraction and hiring plans, when exploring expansion to another location, or when considering an acquisition.\n\n[SHRM members-only toolkit: Practicing Workforce Planning]\n\nIdentify New Skills\n\nNew roles emerge as technology evolves. HR professionals need to know if different skills are becoming critical for existing positions, how jobs are changing and which entirely new professions are emerging. With a combination of current, historical and predictive data, employers can see which abilities are in high demand and how that may shift over time. (Note: Looking for new skills doesn’t necessarily mean looking for new people.)\n\nIf a critical talent segment is in short supply or is more costly in certain locations, that information can help shape your planning, along with the company’s existing business strategy, operational plans and real estate inventory.\n\nThe key to minimizing talent gaps is to be prepared—and not to just react to unanticipated shortages, Love says.",

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nHR technology is undergoing one of the most disruptive periods it has seen in a decade. Investors, seeking the next big thing in breakthrough technology, plunged more than $2 billion into HR tech systems and platforms in 2016, according to CB Insights, a venture capital database. While investment to date is on track for a slight decline from last year, deal activity in HR tech has grown consistently in the last 5 years and at the current rate is expected to increase more than 15 percent over 2015. This amazing investment growth—much of it spent on integrated human resource management system (HRMS) platforms for midsize companies—illustrates the industry’s volatility.\n\nThat instability is being driven by the shift from cloud to mobile; the explosion in analytics and artificial intelligence; and the emergence of video, social recruiting and wearables in the workplace. Everything is changing, and quickly—including the types of technology HR professionals use, the experiences those systems deliver and the underlying software designs—making many of the traditional HR systems purchased only a decade ago seem out of date. With these developments and more reshaping HR, business leaders would be wise to understand the following nine technology trends that will shape the year ahead and beyond.\n\n1. The Performance Management Revolution\n\nFor almost five years, companies have been throwing away ratings, adding check-ins, developing agile goal systems, and making performance management much more data-driven and team-oriented. But there have been almost no tools in the market to automate this—until now. Today, there are at least a dozen companies selling cloud-based, team-centric performance management applications that connect to HR management or enterprise resource planning systems, many of which:\n\nManage performance by team, rather than only by hierarchy.Allow for dynamic team management—that is, the ability to create and change teams quickly.Make goals transparent and easy to change and track.Feature check-in mechanisms.Have built-in pulse surveys, end-of-period surveys, and ad hoc feedback presented via tags and word clouds.Incorporate development plans that are prepopulated, simple to build and based on data derived from employees in similar roles.Feature online assessments, help conducting personality assessments and resources to guide managers through difficult conversations.Can be used with activity streams and other gamification features that make them engaging and browsable.Are integrated with employee directories and other HR tools to become part of everyday work.\n\n2. An Explosion in Real-Time Engagement Evaluation\n\nCustomer and marketing teams have been developing innovative ways to measure customer input for decades. Today, companies are starting to do the same with their employees by making use of always-on, pulse-based feedback systems. Some employers now survey workers quarterly, monthly or even weekly, and many modern systems enable event-based feedback that can be gathered whenever there is a major organizational change.\n\nNot only are these tools becoming critical infrastructure for businesses trying to understand their employees’ needs, they are being integrated with performance management systems, succession planning initiatives, change management strategies and just about every other people practice.\n\nIndeed, feedback-based tools and systems will become a major theme in HR platforms in the coming years.\n\n3. The Rise of People Analytics\n\nI can’t talk about disruptive technology without discussing the enormous strides that have taken place in the field of people analytics. Over the years that I’ve researched this market, organizations have moved from back-office HR data warehouses to advanced analytics and reporting dashboards to predictive models and more.\n\nAs analytics models become more prevalent, companies are slowly moving away from building their own solutions to buying them from vendors. Oracle, SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, ADP, Cornerstone, Visier and Ultimate Software all have employee retention predictors (among many other modeling features) embedded in their software. Workday’s system can identify employee job changes that are likely to result in high-performance outcomes (as well as what job moves not to make). The products from Oracle and SuccessFactors can recommend which training employees should have based on their roles and activities at work, and Workday will soon have this functionality as well. Cornerstone’s system can predict which workers are likely to become noncompliant or lapse in their mandatory training and certification. As these embedded models continue to mature, HR departments will need to hire teams that understand them and can apply them effectively.\n\nNew approaches for applying feedback and models of performance management have also emerged. One vendor, Starling Trust, offers a system that can analyze patterns of e-mail and other communication to build \"trust networks\"; it can actually predict where a security leak or fraud is likely to occur. Another company, Humanyze, sells smart badges that monitor workers’ locations and voice tenor to gauge when and where they experience the most stress. This data can be used to help companies reorganize facilities, change meeting times and formats, and drive engagement.\n\nA third recently-acquired vendor also provides tools that analyze e-mails to assess how people’s communications and time management practices differ. The platform can determine, for example, that high-performing salespeople spend more time than their lower-performing peers with certain groups and customers—and that data can be used to nudge others to change their behavior.\n\nIt’s time to double down on your investment in analytics. My friends at big companies tell me that it takes a few years—and often a big budget—to clean up HR data, bring it into a consolidated environment and hire an analytics team to start doing the work. Organizations that don’t make this investment are likely to be disrupted by competitors that do.\n\n4. Maturation of the Learning Market\n\nWhile most big companies have legacy learning management systems (Cornerstone, SumTotal, Saba, Oracle and SuccessFactors, for example), there are many new options available. Products are being reinvented by vendors issuing major new releases. New solutions like Workday Learning, Fuse Universal, SAP Jam and other tools focus on scaling video learning to the enterprise.\n\nThere is another category of learning products coming that I call \"learning experience platforms.\" They focus on delivering a \"learning platform\" and not just a \"learning management platform.\" In other words, they are places to go to browse and learn, and not merely to register for courses.\n\nThese new platforms bring YouTube-like video experiences to employees and include features for curation, recommended learning and data-driven recommendations. I predict that this new category of software will become huge as every major company realizes it needs these systems as a complement (or, someday, replacement) for its core learning system. Vendors include Degreed, Pathgather, EdCast, Everwise, LinkedIn Learning and others.\n\n[SHRM members-only toolkit: How to Build a High-Performance Culture]\n\n5. A New Landscape for Talent Acquisition\n\nToday’s recruitment and talent acquisition market is enormous—an estimated $240 billion in the United States alone based on research by Bersin by Deloitte. This massive market focuses on tools to help companies:\n\nFind strong job candidates.Market and brand themselves.Post and distribute job postings.Manage and interact with job boards.Conduct prehire skills assessments.Perform background screening and psychological testing.Interview candidates.Manage the entire complex process from end to end via applicant tracking and recruitment management systems.\n\nThese tools are highly strategic for many businesses. Fast-growing technology companies, for example, can make or break their business plans based on how quickly they can find the right engineers, marketing professionals and salespeople. Retailers and seasonal manufacturers need to hire hundreds to thousands of people at critical times during the year, so it is key that they be able to find workers as quickly and effectively as possible at scale.\n\nToday, a new breed of platforms, including those from vendors such as SmartRecruiters, Lever, Greenhouse, Gild and others, have started from scratch, building end-to-end recruitment management systems that handle everything, including sourcing, ad management, analytics, online interviewing, interview management, candidate scoring, ongoing candidate relationship management and onboarding. These tools were designed to directly connect to LinkedIn and other job boards, and they can store candidates’ information so that it can be revisited year after year. In addition to managing applicants, they keep track of candidates and even alumni. Further, they focus on building tools that are easy to use for hiring managers and candidates, and not just recruiters and HR.\n\n[SHRM members-only how-to guide:    How to Use Social Media for Applicant Screening\n\n6. The Growth of Contingent Workforce Management\n\nRoughly 40 percent of workers in the United States are contingent in some fashion, according to government sources, and many of them look for jobs on special networks. Employers use those same channels to post jobs and find people with specialized skills.\n\nThere are two emerging markets that support this new way of working. The first is contingent workforce management systems, such as Fieldglass from SAP, Kronos, Beeline, PeopleFluent, Workday and many others. This sector, which includes software for vendor management, as well as time-tracking and scheduling systems, is highly fragmented with only a few leaders.\n\nThe second market is the gig-work networks that match workers to projects. There are dozens of such solutions, including Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, Workpop and many others. These platforms have morphed from job networks to recruiting and skills-management sites. Companies such as GitHub (for software engineers), Pixelapse (a collaboration platform for designers) and others are building similar tools for technical domains.\n\nHR professionals interested in exploring new options for finding contingent talent should start by monitoring these affinity sites to build a network of experts for contract work.\n\n7. The Adoption of Team Management Tools\n\nA wide variety of software tools have been designed to facilitate collaboration by making it easier for teams to track their work with features such as real-time messaging, archiving and search. These include Slack, Workboard, Trello, Asana, Wrike, BetterWorks, 15Five, Basecamp, Rallyteam and others. While not all of these applications would be categorized as HR technology tools, most are starting to enter the HR space. (BetterWorks, for instance, is actually an enterprise-class goal management platform.)\n\nThe biggest trend taking place in this sector is the steady shift away from solutions used strictly by HR to those that help employees and managers do their jobs. For example, Workday’s new learning management system and talent management system are designed to enable employees to find their next position in their company, and to then locate and view training and video learning appropriate for that job. There is also a shift toward integrating this type of functionality with Outlook or the workflow management tools employees use every day (such as Slack or Asana).\n\n8. A Wealth of Wellness Apps\n\nThe next major area of disruption we can expect in 2017 is the accelerated growth of tools to manage wellness, work/life balance, employee activity and—ultimately—personal performance.\n\nOver the next year, applications for wellness, engagement, recognition and performance management could converge as each of these areas collects information on employee feedback, activity and goals and tries to improve the work environment.\n\nHere’s how this data could come together in the next few years: Core platform providers (such as Oracle, SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, Ultimate Software or others) have built-in analytics engines that correlate data from many sources into a global employee database. These new tools inform the company about what people are doing, how happy they are and how well they are taking care of themselves. Soon we could have a truly integrated view of employee wellness and be able to give workers insights, nudges and advice on ways to make work better, improve productivity and advance their careers.\n\n9. Accelerated Automated HR\n\nHR technology is making bold advances into artificial intelligence, natural language processing and robotic process automation. This huge area covers products that can listen to our voices (such as Amazon Echo, Siri and Viv), augment call center work and connect many systems into a new workflow.\n\nThe result of these technologies, including software development tools for mobile devices, is that most HR transactions can be redesigned, not as a series of transactions that people need to perform but as \"journey maps\" that automate:\n\nThe entire employee joining process, not just hiring. That process may include prehire assessment; interviewing; onboarding; new-hire orientation; and the first six months of training, meeting people and learning.

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nAbby Ludens, vice president of talent management at Mattress Firm in Houston, faced the daunting challenge of hiring and promoting enough gifted employees to keep pace with her company’s explosive corporate growth. Within about six years, the staff had increased to almost 7,000 workers, from less than 1,000.\n\nIn New York City, William Wolf, global head of talent development for Credit Suisse, sought new approaches to identifying high-performing employees at risk of leaving in an effort to prevent their departure from the global financial services company.\n\nAnd at Cigna’s offices in Hartford, Conn., chief learning officer Karen Kocher wanted to figure out what set apart the global insurance organization’s model performers from its lower-rated employees.\n\nHuman resource executives are increasingly using this emerging science to guide them in making workforce decisions. By harnessing the power of algorithmic systems, they can better identify the recruits who are most likely to succeed, choose which high-performing workers to develop and promote, and retain talented leaders who often spur innovation and create value.\n\nThe growth of analytics-driven HR has been dramatic. In early 2015, only 24 percent of companies felt ready or somewhat ready for analytics. Just one year later, that number jumped to 32 percent, according to the Global Human Capital Trends 2016 report from consulting firm Deloitte.\n\n\"We’re moving toward a data-centric mindset\" in HR, says Jason Taylor, chief scientist for New York City-based Infor Talent Science, which develops analytics software designed to predict which job applicants have the highest probability of succeeding. \"We’ve seen lots of organizations making these shifts, measuring performance, identifying behavioral patterns and bringing in the right people based on those patterns,\" Taylor says. \"If you can scale that, not for one person but for everyone, you have an entire organization poised for a high probability of success.\"\n\nData and Hard Judgment\n\nCan algorithms produce better hiring results than people can? To answer that question, researchers from the University of Minnesota and Princeton, N.J.-based Educational Testing Service analyzed 17 studies of job applicant evaluations. Algorithms outperformed human decisions by at least 25 percent. The researchers maintained that their findings hold true \"in any situation with a large number of candidates,\" regardless of the level of the position.\n\nHiring managers \"are easily distracted by things that might be only marginally relevant and they use information inconsistently,\" researchers Nathan Kuncel, Deniz Ones and David Klieger wrote in the May 2014 Harvard Business Review. \"They can be thrown off course by such inconsequential bits of data as applicants’ compliments or remarks on arbitrary topics.\"\n\nFor the best results, the authors recommend that organizations first use algorithms based on a large number of data points to narrow the field of applicants and then tap human judgment to pick from a few finalists. Better yet, have several managers weigh in on the final decision.\n\nThat’s similar to the approach Ludens took at Mattress Firm, which retained a vendor rather than building its own algorithm. Ludens tapped into software from Infor Talent Science to help her team evaluate applicants’ online assessments based on measurable data from 39 behavioral, cognitive and cultural traits. The job seekers’ characteristics were assessed against the profiles of Mattress Firm’s strongest performers—a benchmark managers used for predicting success in given roles.\n\n\"We promoted new hiring managers and hired new employees, and the system was easy and intuitive. We didn’t have to integrate any systems,\" Ludens says, adding that the applicants’ resumes and assessment scores were easy to access and view.\n\nLudens’ team recently examined two years of hiring and sales data. The salespeople that the system had recommended were 80 percent less likely to leave and sold 11 percent more product than others who were hired but not recommended, according to Ludens.\n\n\"When you’re hiring, it’s tempting to not want to listen to the data,\" she says. \"It can be easy for a hiring manager to want to hire someone who walks like them or talks like them or thinks like them.\" But because Mattress Firm was hiring lots of workers over a relatively short period, Ludens says, \"it was important to have the science behind it. We didn’t want to put our company brand at risk, and we wanted to hire people who were a good fit.\"\n\nOf course, there’s a human element to hiring well, too. \"We still talk to applicants. What we want to do is use the data and information to make better hiring decisions,\" Ludens says. \"We won’t get it right all the time. That’s why it’s important to continue to use our hearts and our people to make some of those decisions.\"\n\nDiversity and Quality of Hires\n\nGoogle is a pioneer in using people analytics to create a better workforce. About eight years ago, Laszlo Bock, senior vice president of people operations at the technology giant, assembled a team of Ph.D.s, technologists and consultants to create algorithms that would identify which candidates were most likely to succeed. The team also produced an algorithm that reviewed rejected applications, which helped the company hire engineers that its screening process would have otherwise missed.\n\nGoogle continues to refine its algorithms to uncover insights into employee retention, engagement and performance and to address diversity issues. Company leaders say they were able to refine internal processes to improve diversity in recruiting and promotions.\n\nJetBlue Airways also created its own assessment program in an attempt to improve hiring decisions and, ultimately, the customer experience. An in-house team used advanced analytics to develop predictive models of performance for reservation agents and flight attendants. The New York City-based airline also works with an external business partner to assess prospective reservation agents using analytics, says Andrew Biga, director of talent acquisition and assessment. He oversees hiring for JetBlue, which has some 17,500 employees.\n\nAs a result of the company’s efforts, the quality of hires rose. \"We get more customer compliments—it went up dramatically—and fewer complaints for crew members hired using the new method,\" Biga says. \"The big savings is they’re less likely to leave the company and attrition has gone down. We’re getting people with the right motivational fit, so they’re happy in the job. The more engaged you are in the work, the better the performance.\" He says JetBlue plans to roll out data-driven hiring programs for other positions.\n\nAnother advantage of using data analysis to support hiring is that companies reduce the potential for bias in decision-making. \"From a compliance perspective, we’ve gotten much better at doing things in a fair and consistent way. It’s a main reason to do something like this,\" Biga says.\n\nAttrition and Incentives\n\nAt Credit Suisse, Wolf built a department of analysts in HR who specialize in using workforce data to aid in recruiting and to reduce voluntary attrition costs, without the involvement of the company’s IT team. Driving down the attrition rate among some 46,600 Credit Suisse employees by just 1 percent a year could save the company up to $100 million annually, he says.\n\nUsing insights gleaned from the data it collected, the analytics team developed policies and practices designed to retain workers. For example, Wolf’s team learned that filling open positions with internal candidates had been an effective tool for retaining employees in the past. So it developed a \"Grow Your Own\" campaign, which encourages those responsible for hiring to \"look inside and give the right of first refusal\" to current employees. HR professionals also contact employees with the appropriate skills and potential to ask if they’d be interested in the open positions.\n\n\"Five years ago, we only looked inside about 40 percent of the time, and now it’s up to 80 percent,\" Wolf says. \"If I have a vice president position open and I’m growing my own, I’m pulling people up and giving them new responsibilities. We know that internal mobility is really attractive to people.\"\n\nEach year, staff at Credit Suisse processes data involving 80 variables and 30,000 employees to help predict who might jump ship. The information collected includes workers’ performance ratings, their bosses’ ratings, their compensation changes from year to year, and the length of time in the job without a promotion.\n\nThe model \"shows you who is at risk [of leaving the company], and it tends to be correct,\" Wolf says.\n\nThe organization generates reports for managers showing the relative flight risk of their employees. The managers then can give workers a raise, a promotion, access to career development training or something else to ward off a departure.\n\n\"The model is a better predictor of [a person] leaving than managers are of their own people,\" he says. \"Analytics help you better understand what’s happening.\"\n\nGamification and Insights\n\nAt Cigna, Kocher used a gamified approach to analytics to help assess managers’ performance and upward-mobility potential. Palo Alto, Calif.-based company Knack supplied the games, which are played on a mobile phone and help to identify the skills, abilities and competencies at which the players excel, as well as the qualities they might consider developing. This is done by looking at their decision-making, actions and reactions in the context of the games.\n\nAmong the behavioral patterns evaluated: problem-solving, quick thinking, logical reasoning, executive presence, learning agility, risk-taking and innovation.\n\n\"We looked for people demonstrating the highest degrees of performance levels and pulled a subset. We had them play the Knack games to see about their ways of doing things,\" Kocher says. \"From that, you form a profile.\"\n\nThe results can be eye-opening. At Cigna, for example, \"What’s come back has been more insightful than we expected,\" Kocher says. \"The Knack data gives you information at a granular level, and it becomes so much clearer what needs to be developed within the group and how it should be handled.\"\n\nKnack’s analytics software brings up a dashboard that shows where employees in various groups excel or need improvement. The information enables Kocher’s team to blend \"the qualitative with the quantitative\" in looking for competencies that align with what the company is searching for in employees, such as perseverance, customer focus, willingness to take risks and interpersonal savvy. Now the group is using the Knack games for much larger groups to validate earlier findings and for quantitative insights.\n\n\"We’re looking at the characteristics of high-performing, effective managers. We have 4,000 managers around the world,\" Kocher says. \"We’re hoping to better understand what it takes to be a higher-performing manager.\" Her team uses the information to assist people in developing their management skills based on the profile of top performers. \"We’re not only having individuals be more successful with their teams; as an organization, we’re driving strategy forward.\"\n\nAXA, a New York City-based financial services business, funnels considerable resources toward management training and development. But correlations linking the data from Knack, one of two talent analytics companies AXA hired, to employees’ behavioral patterns revealed surprising findings.\n\n\"We found we were lower than expected in certain skills as a company—in particular, learning agility, an attribute connected to learning new skills,\" says Rino Piazzolla, a senior executive director and chief human resources officer. \"That was a surprise for us because we always spend a lot of money on management training. This is helping us rethink career development.\"\n\nCostly technology and infrastructure changes aren’t necessary for companies to benefit from the broad insights and business value that analytics can provide, according to Piazzolla. \"This isn’t about IT and infrastructure,\" he says. \"What you need are different types of people in HR. The biggest challenge in the HR function is to have people with a much stronger analytical background who understand numbers and draw correlations and insight vs. the traditional HR professional who is all about feelings and perception and things you don’t measure.\" \"Put aside your belief system for a moment. Get engaged,\" Piazzolla advises. \"Decide collectively on this new way of doing things. We want to create HR services that are more meaningful to our people in the future. We want to be a successful company tomorrow. This is all about tomorrow.\"\n\nCarole Fleck is the content director for Diabetes Forecast magazine.Illustration by Randy Pollak for HR Magazine.",

      "full_text": "When employees quit, it’s costly.\n\nPredictive analytics can help HR with employee retention and improve an organization’s performance. Through statistical modeling, it is possible to determine which of the many possible factors most influence the workforce’s decisions to stay or quit, and then to develop a strategy and act on it.\n\nHuman resources at FinCo Management, a large financial services firm, did exactly this for its call center employees. The Fortune 500 Company believed retention was crucial to its business. FinCo built predictive turnover models for its call centers, drawing on historical personnel data from its HR systems to understand what factors were causally connected to higher or lower probabilities of quitting. The results revealed clear links and actionable insights around compensation, career development, experience levels, mobility and work/life balance as its key drivers of retention. The results helped to reinforce and refine current efforts in these areas, ultimately improving call center performance.\n\nExploring the Past to Predict the Future\n\nBy looking across five years of historical data, predictive statistical models were developed for call center employees—modeling their likelihoods of quitting within the following month and within the following year. The objective was not to forecast turnover rates or head counts. Instead, these turnover models were developed to study and understand which predictors led to the greatest increases and decreases in the probability of call center employees quitting, and by how much.\n\nHuman resource practitioners have long estimated that costs associated with employee turnover can range up to a substantial portion of an employee’s salary. FinCo estimated that for every employee retained, it could realize a savings of approximately 25 percent of the employee’s first-year salary through productivity gains, as well as from avoiding costs associated with the recruiting, onboarding and training of replacement hires. FinCo set out to gain insights from large amounts of archived data to help build a better place to work for its employees, while also improving its own organizational performance.\n\nThree broad categories of data were collected and examined as predictors of turnover in its model: individual attributes, organizational factors and external influences. These categories were selected based on research from global consulting leader Mercer and from experience that linked them as the common sources for causal factors leading to employment outcomes. Individual attributes included factors about the employees’ work history such as age, tenure, career level, promotion and so on. Organizational factors consisted of the internal work environment such as organizational segment and the recent turnover rate at the call center site. External influences included characteristics about the outside market and the geography in which the employees resided, such as local area unemployment rates.\n\nExcept for external influences, all data were sourced from FinCo’s human resource information systems, where data for all employees who had worked at its call centers had been accumulating for numerous years. All of these factors were examined simultaneously. This means that inferences were isolated to each individual predictor when explaining its impact on an outcome. For example, this method allowed for inferences such as “If an employee is promoted within the past year (the predictor, X), he or she has a 30 percent lower probability of quitting within the next year (the outcome, Y)—holding all other factors constant.” Put another way, it allowed for causal inferences. In this example, if two individuals had similar qualities and experiences, and the only material difference observed was that one was promoted and the other was not, the employee who was promoted had a lower chance of quitting (30 percent less). In other words, promotions reduced an individual’s likelihood of choosing to quit.\n\nKnow Data Inside Out\n\nTo drive change with data, it is critical to know the audience and know your data. Analyses can always examine more factors and data will never be perfect, so understanding where there are potential gaps and pitfalls is crucial. Study their implications and be ready to talk about them with senior leaders. Insightful analytics and good storytelling are often the first steps in driving change, especially as organizations grow larger and become more complex. Discussing the findings, developing buy-in from leaders and decision-makers, and gaining credibility and building positive relational capital are important to successfully achieving data-driven actions and results.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUse predictive analytics to drive organizational intelligence and performance. Uncover workforce dynamics and drivers of employment outcomes; use this to start the dialogue around truly evidence-based policy actions and practices. Findings are unique to your organization. Don’t cut and paste results from other organizations. What’s important to Company ABC or Competitor XYZ may be less relevant to your business and organizational culture. Be patient, and stick with it. It can take years to build the right metrics and analytics into a workforce management process. Leverage what you have and combine multiple sources of information. Start with the data you and your organization are already measuring, and look for evidence across multiple sources of information. Know your data, your audience and the internal landscape. Understand and navigate the internal dynamics within your organization to successfully use data for driving change. Seek out well-connected leaders within your organization to promote, facilitate and lend credibility to your findings.

      "full_text": "HR operations provide the essential structures and processes that organizations depend on daily, including payroll,  compliance, and change management. But with fast-moving workplace disruption, just keeping core functions running no longer satisfies talent demands. Modern operations must also actively improve experiences and culture to attract skilled professionals who expect more.\n\nAs innovations reshape work almost continually, companies struggle to adapt rigid frameworks fast enough to support employees through so much change. Those who fail to retain and reskill talent lose out to more responsive competitors. Organizations must become more agile in empowering people toward shared success.\n\nAs exponential change compounds with rising generational differences, only 32% of employees reported individual change capability considerations in development plans and a mere 43% praised organizational change management—down from 60% in 2019. This gap highlights the pivotal need for HR systems with embedded dexterity capable of keeping pace with the unprecedented shifts transforming work.\n\nThe Expert Perspective\n\nSHRM Labs’ Better Workplaces Challenge Cup Fireside Chat series offers a platform to distill wisdom from leaders guiding HR innovation. Our latest guest, Dawn Sharifan, shared hard-won insights from streamlining operations at pioneering companies Slack and Salesforce. Sharifan detailed building efficient systems to empower employees amid emerging challenges as workplace transformations accelerated.\n\nAbout 85% of HR leaders were planning to increase or maintain HR tech budgets in 2024, partly thanks to remote trends. Nearly half of the companies surveyed have modernized their talent management infrastructure, which was once seen as a luxury. As an authority on significant transitions, Sharifan provided a practical playbook for leaders still struggling to update rigid frameworks that are inhibiting their agility.\n\nSharifan’s expertise has proven invaluable in an era of unprecedented disruption that is realigning the employer-employee relationship. Without dexterous systems attuned to rising expectations around experience, companies risk losing out on critical human potential that can power competitive differentiation. Though transformation journeys vary, responsive operations can unlock the capabilities and culture vital for growth.\n\nEnhancing the Employee Experience\n\nFor Sharifan, efficient processes establish a platform for strategic culture building: “You have to have efficient processes so that you can then create the space for all those human moments, community building, creativity, and innovation.”\n\nStreamlined operations enrich the culture and experiences that attract top talent by liberating bandwidth for more strategic priorities. However, most legacy HR systems remain siloed by department and disjointed in capabilities.\n\nCareful diagnoses of existing tools against talent needs and desired outcomes are foundational to meaningful upgrades. Defining success clarifies what change investments are required. In addition, cross-departmental coordination prevents disjointed efforts when transitioning entrenched systems, which allows for holistic transformations.\n\nSpearheading Change Management\n\nCharting meaningful organizational change is no small feat. Transformations require strategic transparency on expected timelines, outcomes, and responsibilities at the outset to inform stakeholders and prevent confusion. Progress relies on compassionate, persistent communications across multiple platforms to sustain alignment.\n\nHowever, research on global workplace culture has revealed that when change efforts sideline employee perspectives, over 1 in 5 workers (22%) reported feeling that their organization does not care about them personally. Strikingly, among those with poor culture perceptions, a staggering 87% said they believe their organization does not care about them, versus just 8% of those with positive views of workplace culture.\n\nLeaders must actively solicit input to refine upgrades that reflect authentic needs, not merely top-down assumptions. This empathetic co-creation can cement sustainable improvements that are resilient to disruption. With employment lawsuits soaring 400% over 20 years, soliciting ongoing user feedback can further refine upgrades that reflect real needs rather than merely top-down assumptions. This empathetic co-creation cements sustainable improvements that are resilient to disruption.\n\nSHRM data showed that over 1 in 5 workers (22%) feel their organization does not care about them personally when change efforts neglect employee perspectives. Even more strikingly, among those rating their workplace culture as poor, 87% indicated that their organization does not care about them, compared to only 8% of those viewing their workplace culture as good.\n\nUltimately, leaders must spearhead structured change management that upholds accountability while gathering continuous feedback. Failing to actively incorporate these perspectives risks miscalibration to talent desires, jeopardizing the adoption of changes deemed inadequate. Research found that change management capabilities rank eighth in importance yet only 20th in current capabilities, indicating significant room for improvement in this area. In an increasingly litigious environment, change risks invite legal exposure that organizations can ill afford. However, companies that involve stakeholders through upgrades can evolve fluidly in step with accelerating workplace innovation.\n\nOngoing Compliance Progress\n\nOnly 36% of HR respondents reported full confidence in managing ever-evolving regulations, indicating a difficulty in integrating compliance alongside daily operations. The immense and intensifying burden of multifaceted compliance leaves most departments overstretched by complexity, relying on disjointed manual monitoring capabilities that are unable to govern risk holistically. Organizations that dedicate focused personnel avoid piecemeal visibility and dated legal understandings that could invite severe violations.\n\nAs regulations accelerate across jurisdictions, compliance should no longer be dispersed but should instead be centralized under invested leadership. Configurable platforms integrating legal updates can provide systematic guardrails, easing this encumbrance through proactive alerts and controls.\n\nInforming Decisions via Data\n\nRather than assumptions, workforce insights should direct planning aligned to skills needs, present and projected performance, and trends like automation disruption, as Sharifan described. Extensive employee life cycle data further evidences opportunities surrounding:\n\nData-driven headcount planning grounded in performance metrics.Proactive skills gap identification guiding development priorities.Workforce future-proofing to recognize how roles may redistribute.\n\nAbout 70% of data-driven executives reported that such people analytics delivers essential talent strategy impacts, including empowering recruiting and sustaining engagement and retention. They prove more likely to report adequate change readiness—an indispensable capability amid disruption.\n\nLearning Fuels Innovation\n\nEmployees relaying external innovations back into operations prevent stagnation by continually enhancing approaches with fresh concepts integrated into internal goals. Such shared growth mindsets signal a reciprocal leadership commitment to mutual advancement rather than isolated upskilling.\n\nSHRM research on emerging professionals revealed that almost 90% of employers seek adaptability and willingness to learn in early talent, which are strengths that over two-thirds exhibit. Meanwhile, over 80% of organizations agreed that learning cultures enhance resilience and employee experiences. Additional data showed that over 75% are more likely to stay amid continuous training, which attracted almost half of employee respondents to their current employer.\n\nFostering cultures hungry for constant improvement unlocks immense synergies. Employees conveying external best practices manifest collective advancement. However, growth must remain inclusive, not exclusive, with upskilling reaching across all levels. Ultimately, building reciprocal growth cultures cements organizational resilience amid accelerating workplace change.\n\nWith the half-lives of skills shrinking rapidly, organizations must champion continuous learning and adopt best practices to avoid lagging behind. A SHRM study on emerging professionals revealed that while only about one-third expected to stay at their next role for four or more years, double that proportion—nearly two-thirds—said they would commit to four or more years if they were given consistent upskilling to build in-demand competencies. Companies that are able to distill insights companywide and respond accordingly are better equipped to retain coveted adaptable talent.\n\nBest Practices for Evolving HR Operations\n\nPeople analytics utilizes workforce data to guide planning, enhancing program efficacy. However, 56% of users said they focus analytics on retention and turnover specifically—broader applications remain untapped. Still, an evidence-based approach has proven to boost productivity and inclusion. Organizations leveraging analytics outperformed peers 3.1 times more often in overall talent outcomes. Urgent risks also warrant rapid responses informed by available data instead of awaiting perfect models—71% of companies now prioritize analytics even when they lack perfection.\n\nFor example, a retail chain noticing rising turnover among store managers could analyze performance metrics to reveal unrealistic expectations from new customer conversion rate targets. Simply tweaking the targets and providing additional training might quickly improve retention within months. Without analysis, changes that are expensive and broader would have taken longer to yield results.\n\nAnalytics should integrate inputs from staff surveys, inclusion and diversity metrics, learning platform usage rates, and leading indicators such as engagement alongside lagging outcome data. Layering qualitative insights will help explain figures and test assumptions. Though technology consolidates information, human context guides effective solutions.\n\nWith skills rapidly evolving, continuous learning is crucial for organizations to keep pace with innovation. Business leaders at all levels should champion development opportunities, preventing stagnation. However, hierarchies often inhibit the bottom-up sharing of insights from customer-facing staff, detecting emerging preference shifts. Facilitating inclusive, multidirectional knowledge flows builds the capacity to navigate unpredictable futures. Three-fourths of employees (76%) said additional skills training makes a company more appealing, with 74% of employees saying they are willing to retrain. Those with strong learning cultures are 92% more likely to develop innovative products and processes.\n\nDeveloping curiosity beyond formal training cultivates the agility to pivot amid volatility. Managers should encourage experimentation through stretch assignments. Mentorship and job rotation can also supplement role-specific mastery with cross-functional literacy. Most importantly, growth mindsets acknowledging inevitable knowledge gaps reduce complacency. Lifelong learning is critical for both individual and organizational resilience.\n\nBefore implementation, communicating objectives, outcomes, and indicators facilitates adoption by directly articulating expected benefits. Persistent, compassionate messaging then reinforces changes. However, research showed that only 34% of initiatives succeed outright, with 16% reporting mixed results—emphasizing the need for improvement. Strong practices boost performance 3.5 times more than peers. Collaboration and continuous feedback further drive adoption. Still, 70% of programs failed to achieve goals due to employee resistance and lack of management support, so overcoming these barriers remains critical.\n\nFor example, an HR manager championing a cloud-based system must first align stakeholders on challenges and progress indicators to accelerate results. Periodically reassessing against the initial outcomes framework upholds continuity.\n\nBeyond initial rollouts, continuity planning maintains momentum. Celebrating quick wins preserves energy, and troubleshooting issues transparently models responsiveness. Ultimately, change sticks when it is ingrained in updated workflows and processes—one-off interventions alone rarely transform mindsets or operations long term. Sustaining change requires persistence and patience.\n\nDedicated personnel integrate legal updates into systematic governance guardrails to enhance compliance visibility. Configurable platforms automatically flag outdated policies to boost responsiveness. In fact, 61% of HR professionals cited rapidly evolving regulations as their biggest compliance challenge. Technology solutions can help manage requirements—57% of organizations said they utilize them. Centralized data facilitates efficient audit responses, earning higher shareholder returns.\n\nSmaller organizations should digitize manuals for easier updating, utilize external advisory support, and automate essential monitoring. Working groups also enable holistic input on interpreting updates. Above all, compliance should become an organizational capability, not just an HR function—cross-functional collaboration embeds responsiveness at all levels.\n\nStandard operating procedures codifying policy interpretations will boost consistency companywide. FAQs answering common questions can supplement formal documentation. Ultimately, compliance is strengthened through transparency—obscurity and overcomplexity invite issues. Streamlining while involving stakeholders minimizes risks.\n\nModern infrastructure enhances HR’s agility to address emerging challenges—almost 50% have adopted cloud-based platforms that support remote work. Still, 59% of digital transformation efforts prioritized elevating broader employee experiences—not just tools. Integrated systems directly boost productivity 2.5 times over siloed ones. Thus, coordination ensuring continuity with finance or communication systems remains essential. Diagnosing needs against desired talent outcomes should inform platform modernization.\n\nFor example, replacing annual reviews with continuous performance conversations better supports agile goal-setting. Some overhaul entire talent management philosophies beforehand. Cross-departmental alignment on community building and culture also minimizes disruptions.\n\nPlatform decisions require balancing specialization with integration—niche point solutions can better address specific functions, yet they also complicate broader workflows. Regardless of architecture, seamless mobile access and consumer-grade interfaces matching external digital experiences should be mandated. Though a significant investment initially, modernization enhances responsiveness to new workplace dynamics.\n\nThe Future of Operations\n\nEmerging dynamics around automation, remote work, and next-generation talent present fresh challenges. As Sharifan noted, accessible automation allows for the smoothing of repetitive tasks. However, maintaining human connection and developmental support remains vital even in dispersed environments—especially for historically social Generation Z professionals, who are increasingly constituting more of the workforce.\n\nLeaders must continually balance emerging preferences like flexibility with productivity imperatives, cultural implications, and automation opportunities to retain top talent while upholding output. Even dispersed teams require inclusion, developmental support, and community.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nCrucial frameworks certainly enable success, but only continuous learning and adaptation allow HR operations to evolve smoothly amid escalating expectations and relentless change. Conferences, podcasts, and academic programs will accelerate this capability evolution, but leaders must champion modernization to empower rather than inhibit talent throughout ongoing transformations.\n\nFAQs\n\nHR operations encompass the essential daily activities enabling enterprise success—the workflows, processes, and change management mechanisms that organizations rely on. This includes core functions such as payroll, compliance, data management, and process execution. However, amid rising expectations, solely foundational capabilities no longer suffice. Leading operations must also actively enrich culture and the employee experience.\n\nSuccessful transformations first require clarity on objectives, expected outcomes, and success indicators before implementation. To inform stakeholders, changes should be communicated through persistent, compassionate messaging across multiple platforms. Cross-functional collaboration is essential, with clear owners empowered to drive accountability and gather continuous feedback for recurring enhancements. This empathetic co-creation sustains upgrades that reflect actual user needs.\n\nWith regulations multiplying across global jurisdictions, compliance is no longer just a back-office function but is now a strategic imperative—the risk of noncompliance is severe fines or lawsuits, given intensifying enforcement and penalties. Leading operations centralize compliance under specialized personnel instead of leaving it dispersed and siloed. Core platforms also integrate real-time legal updates to ease monitoring burdens through proactive controls and alerts. Despite having constrained resources, smaller organizations should utilize automation, digitization, and working groups to govern critical measures systematically.\n\nRather than assumptions, people analytics leverages workforce data spanning the employee life cycle to guide planning around engagement, recruiting, roles, and skills. This shift from conjecture to evidence-based vision powered by analytics enhances the efficacy of programs, boosting retention, productivity, and inclusion. Leaders can balance the urgent risks that accompany innovation periods without experiencing needless delays while awaiting perfect data.\n\nSources\n\nThe Use of People Analytics in Human Resources: Current State and Best Practices Moving Forward, SHRM.Expectations and Realities: Preparing the Next Generation of Talent for the World of Work, SHRM.How AI Is Changing HR Jobs and Tasks, SHRM.2022 Workplace Learning & Development Trends, SHRM.The State of Global Workplace Culture in 2023: An International Model for Building Better Workplaces, SHRM.Set the Right People Priorities for Challenging Times, 2023, BCG.Three Reasons Behind Those Change Management Failure Statistics, Change Synergy.HR Compliance: Everything You Need to Know, UpCounsel.The Business Case for Change Management When Driving Organization Transformation, WTW.HR Professionals Lack Confidence in Their Compliance Status, Benefits Pro.2024 HR Technology Imperatives, Gartner.\n\nNo Data\n\nNo Data\n\nNo Data",

      "full_text": "As remote and hybrid models become more mainstream and talent pools undergo demographic shifts, performance strategies must evolve to engage employees and actively sustain productivity. Research by Gallup found that organizations with highly engaged workforces maintained a ratio of 14 engaged employees for every 1 actively disengaged employee, which is over six times the average ratio nationally. This massive difference in engagement demonstrates the imperative behind redefining performance approaches.\n\nThis article summarizes key insights on redefining performance management from global talent strategy leader Arun Bedi, featured on SHRM’s recent Better Workplaces Challenge Cup Fireside Chat exploring innovations in the workplace. It condenses research-backed best practices and timely perspectives into comprehensive, actionable guidance for people leaders seeking to bolster productivity and retention despite disruption.\n\nCentering Business Acumen and Critical Thinking in Learning Frameworks\n\nBedi said that rather than over-indexing tactical job skills that quickly commoditize, impactful learning and development programs should concentrate on building more generalizable cognitive competencies such as sophisticated critical thinking, creative problem-solving, adaptable decision-making, and strategic analytical abilities. This will better equip knowledge workers to dynamically react to both opportunities and obstacles with innovation, allowing fluid redeployment across roles.\n\nFraming training around immersive, multimedia simulations of comprehensive business operations at scale rather than isolated departmental technicals will also boost productivity substantially by providing contextual understanding. Employees can grasp how their contributions deliver collective value. Bespoke vocational skills can then be layered atop these robust foundations.\n\nBedi argued against overprioritizing tactical skills, explaining that “it’s about developing critical thinking skills” to adapt fluidly. He advocated training that is grounded in total business operations, noting that Visa’s immersive transactional simulations reflect how “new hire orientation is really understanding a transaction from end to end.” This context drives productivity and successful outcomes.\n\nCultivating Coaching and Feedback Across Organizations\n\nExemplary coaching concentrates on far more than reactively addressing immediate performance gaps. Instead, exceptional coaches collaboratively co-create personalized development pathways aligned to near-term departmental priorities and longer-term career growth. They also introduce stretch assignments to actualize latent potential. Yet alarmingly, Bedi noted that coaching remains drastically underutilized operationally, even though data has conclusively shown that regular high-quality coaching delivers exponential returns on investment when scaled. About three-quarters of employees (76%) said continuous training makes them more likely to stay with their current organization, but only 36% said they receive reskilling now and 55% feel they need more training to perform better, showing immense untapped potential.\n\nThe basics are generally grasped, with 3 in 4 respondents (75%) saying they are satisfied with the quality of their training. However, coaching remains the most underutilized management skill despite its immense potential. A Gallup study determined that 74% of actively disengaged employees were open to new job opportunities, compared to just 55% of unengaged employees and 30% of engaged workers. Boosting engagement through better coaching can help retain talent.\n\nCodifying coaching excellence into incentives, learning tracks, and leadership development programs with formalized competency models can help organizations gradually shift away from outdated authoritarian management preferences that compromise agility, inclusion, and morale. About 70% already receive compliance training and 51% receive soft-skills training, but leadership coaching remains underutilized operationally. Simply instituting recurring check-ins will safeguard progress, and public praise for effective coaching will also propagate constructive modeling. Moreover, SHRM research indicated more than two-thirds of employees prefer learning in a simulation format, with over 50% preferring a coaching or mentoring style. Soon, these adapted training and coaching approaches will foster lasting growth.\n\nLeveraging People Analytics to Validate Assumptions\n\nBedi acknowledged that people analytics platforms remain in relatively early developmental stages, but still said that targeted measurements can validate strategies’ effectiveness despite the imperfect models. In North America, more than 9 in 10 respondents (93%) cited driving organizational performance as a critical objective for performance management, yet only 44% said their performance management program has met that objective to date. Advanced analytics offer the potential to improve this gap.\n\nSHRM research revealed that organizations are presently utilizing people analytics most frequently for employee retention and turnover (82%), recruitment and hiring (71%), engagement (59%), compensation and rewards (58%), and performance management (58%). Even while capabilities are maturing, targeted analytics in these areas can already validate assumptions and strategies.\n\nWith analytical models growing increasingly sophisticated, the coming years should reveal far more robust capabilities for accurate talent deductions to further boost performance. However, leaders must balance awaiting elusive perfect data with responsively addressing talent needs as they emerge.\n\nBedi warned against over-reliance before maturity, but he said he sees judicious application eliminating previous guesswork by guiding enhancement cycles with evidence. Leaders must balance the urgency and risks accompanying innovation periods without needless delays while they await elusive perfect data. SHRM research revealed that over three-quarters of organizations utilizing people analytics (77%) remain at early maturity levels, with 37% at level 1 (operational reporting) and another 40% at level 2 (advanced reporting), indicating significant room for advancement. In addition, organizations that move beyond just reporting to prediction with their people analytics will likely realize more value from their HR efforts.  With analytical models growing increasingly sophisticated, the coming years should reveal far more robust capabilities for accurate talent deductions.\n\nAdapting to Evolving Talent Motivations Around Purpose\n\nRising generations increasingly show less willingness to silo personal and professional identities into disconnected domains that demand substantial identity switching between roles. Instead, top talent now often seeks a unified purpose and meaning that seamlessly bridges across both work and life facets into holistic, fulfilled existence through their vocations. Bedi said he believes that integrating this passion and social impact into performance programs unlocks reciprocal commitment and engagement.\n\nAs talent increasingly seeks purpose and unity between work and life, Bedi said, “aligning your passion with your purpose is an art and a science” that unlocks engagement when personalized. SHRM research revealed that 63% of organizations planned to have a formal or informal mentoring program in 2024, which can provide the personalized coaching and development opportunities many employees now prioritize. Bedi framed consistent “two-way feedback” as the bedrock of responsive systems amid exponential change. These regular feedback cycles, personalized coaching, and alignment of analytics with individual development goals are pivotal for adapting to these shifts. Creative challenge embeddings also let employees actualize positive potential. Ultimately, leadership must keep a finger on the pulse of the cultural forces that shape the meaning of work.\n\nBedi provided a comprehensive blueprint for continuously evolving performance strategies to drive productivity through periods of unprecedented change via enhanced skill-building, updated coaching models, and progressive data utilization. However, it emphasizes that ideological and operational flexibility remain equally vital to responding to accelerating shifts in workplace dynamics and motivations among talent.\n\nFeatured Startups Optimizing Performance\n\nA growing crop of human capital startups are aiming to disrupt performance management, offering a range of next-generation solutions that leverage advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and platform technologies. This section profiles leading innovators and their capabilities that are elevating productivity, leadership development, skills alignment, and more to equip HR leaders with emerging options to supplement traditional programs.\n\nCognitive Talent Solutions: Founded by Francisco Marin, this startup leverages organizational network analysis (ONA), surveys, and AI to map informal networks and identify influential leaders, aiding functions such as leadership development and change management.Keep Company: Co-founded by Claudia Naim-Burt and Adrienne Belyea, Keep Company helps organizations quantify and support employee caregivers through census data, skill-building groups for parents and caregivers, and analytics dashboards that allocate relevant resources.MuchSkills: Led by Daniel Nilsson, MuchSkills offers an employee-centric solution that enables workforce planning and talent alignment centered around individuals’ strengths and passions. A customizable skill taxonomy and data visualizations identify skills gaps.Ovida: This leadership development platform from Alex Haitiglou and Bryan Watson securely records workplace interactions and provides AI-driven insights paired with coaching from human experts for continuous, measurable leadership skills improvement that mirrors athletic coaching models.\n\nThese startups showcase innovative new performance optimization approaches that harness advanced analytics, organizational network mapping, workforce planning around skills and passions, and AI-enabled leadership development.\n\nBest Practices in Performance Management\n\nFostering a continuous feedback culture is crucial for effective performance management. Organizations should replace annual reviews with more frequent check-ins to provide ongoing development opportunities. Nearly all employees (94%) said they prefer real-time feedback to formal reviews. These regular touchpoints enable workplaces to promptly address issues and reinforce positive behaviors. Organizations see 14.9% lower turnover rates with continuous feedback and report 85% of their staff members taking more initiative.\n\nBeyond reducing turnover and absenteeism, continuous feedback boosts innovation by encouraging experimentation and risk-taking. Employees feel safer stretching beyond their comfort zone, knowing managers will guide them in real time. This agility and growth mindset fuels new ideas. Ultimately, the transparency of regular check-ins builds trust on both sides.\n\nEnhancing coaching and mentoring initiatives further optimizes performance. Crafting personalized development plans aligned with company goals and individual aspirations facilitates growth. Three-fourths of employees (76%) said mentoring is vital for their career development. Strong coaching cultures increase productivity by 51% and 67% of businesses confirmed that mentoring itself directly raises productivity.\n\nEffective coaching and mentoring depend on matching based on strengths, development areas, and interpersonal chemistry. HR should gauge interest and skills to make recommendations. Trained mentors must commit time to regular meetings while being open-minded and empowering. For the best results, coaching and mentoring should evolve from an additional responsibility to an integrated cultural element.\n\nLeading indicators like engagement provide real-time performance insights to guide leaders. Comprehensive HR information systems consolidate relevant metrics for easy analysis. About 7 in 10 companies (71%) now see people analytics as a high priority. Companies employing people analytics are two times more likely to improve recruiting. Though performance management is essential, 95% of managers are dissatisfied with their current processes.\n\nAnalytics inform everything including compensation decisions, learning program efficacy, and diversity initiatives. They also identify behavioral drivers of performance. Though technology streamlines tracking, the human element remains vital for contextualizing data and guiding actions. Analytics are a means, not an end—without sound interpretation and thoughtful application, their insights get wasted. Leaders must actively leverage analytics rather than passively consume reports.\n\nIndividual objectives should connect with overarching organizational goals and missions. Developing a broader business acumen through training supplements role-specific performance. This holistic approach will boost critical-thinking and problem-solving skills companywide; 91% of companies with practical performance management link employee goals to business priorities. However, only 14% are confident that their process drives business value. Those with alignment are 3.5 times more likely to be top performers.\n\nBeyond better business outcomes, goal alignment provides meaning and purpose to staff at all levels. Understanding how daily work impacts higher objectives fosters engagement and inspiration. It facilitates innovation, too, as employees connect activities to desired impact. Misalignment, on the other hand, breeds confusion, frustration, and the duplication of efforts. HR is central to educating and involving cross-functional leaders in articulating and cascading aligned goals at multiple tiers.\n\nOutcome-based assessments are essential, emphasizing results over processes. Tools to enable communication, feedback, and tracking facilitate engagement despite logistical challenges. A whopping 84% of employees confirmed they can do their jobs just as effectively remotely, with 55% wanting a hybrid model. Yet, 72% of companies lacked detailed hybrid work strategies, emphasizing the need for new approaches.\n\nVirtual performance management demands transparency around expectations and availability. Scheduling regular check-ins maintains connectivity while conveying trust in staff. Seeking input on optimal collaboration models respects individual working styles, too. The key is balancing accountability with flexibility—strict rules erode autonomy, while misalignment causes confusion. Therefore, mastering hybrid management unlocks innovation.\n\nSupporting personal growth alongside professional development boosts satisfaction and engagement. Providing work/life balance resources and aligning goals with purpose enables employees to thrive. According to SHRM, 80% of employees would be more likely to stay with their current employer if they were offered robust mental health resources. Firms prioritizing wellness see 21% higher profitability, with 61% of workers saying their work positively affects overall well-being.\n\nWell-being stems from complete health across emotional, physical, financial, and social dimensions. Thus, employers should offer holistic programs that are equipped to address diverse needs and include counseling, nutrition guidance, and financial coaching. Most importantly, organizational values must model healthy attitudes around self-care, sustainability, and work/life harmony. Leadership behaviors set the tone—when executives openly discuss mental health or take vacations, it empowers their employees to prioritize wellness, too.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nAs Bedi summarized, optimizing performance management for modern workforces requires integrating enhanced skills development programming, scaled coaching resources, and progressive people analytics platforms. However, frameworks must align to the motivational shifts that talent expects today, appealing to desires for purpose actualization beyond purely fiscal goals alone.\n\nHalf of all companies (49%) still operate on semiannual or annual review cycles, but SHRM found that 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4 men, including 34% of Millennials, have been emotionally overwhelmed by these formal assessments. Rethinking standardized cycles to include regular touchpoints focused on growth and engagement can prevent such disempowering experiences while embodying the frequent feedback and supportive guidance that emerging generations respond better to amid accelerated disruption. Adapting both structures and leadership styles flexibly unlocks productivity balanced with meaning.\n\nOrganizations face intensifying demands to transcend transactional performance relationships, build inclusive coaching capacity companywide, leverage analytics judiciously, and continuously update their approaches to reflect emerging priorities. By acknowledging this, they can retain top talent, prevent churn risk, and empower employees to drive strategic success simultaneously despite exponential uncertainty. But such optimizations require starting from the talent experience when shaping the people processes that companies will build futures upon. Employees today desire partnered growth more than mandated performance.\n\nFAQs\n\nFocus on developing critical thinking skills. Ensure programs help employees understand the business end to end. Encourage exploration of unknown areas.\n\nAddress current performance issues. Foster long-term career and professional growth.\n\nFocus on leading indicators for decision-making. Validate assumptions with data after completion.\n\nWhat are the critical components of effective performance management?\n\nAlign employee passion with organizational purpose. Provide regular, meaningful feedback. Promote a culture of coaching.\n\nAdjust performance management practices for remote and hybrid work environments. Focus on personalized approaches that align with employee passions and purposes.\n\nSources\n\nThe Performance Review Problem, SHRMThe Use of People Analytics in Human Resources: Current State and Best Practices Moving Forward, SHRMGet Rid of Performance Reviews, SHRMSHRM State of the Workplace Report, 2022-2023, SHRMHigh-Performing Leaders Embrace Continuous Feedback, SHRMSHRM Report Underscores Global Importance of Workplace CultureResearch Informs Global Workplace Culture Model, SHRMStrengthening Workplace Culture: A Tool for Retaining and Empowering Employees Globally, 2022, SHRM2022 Workplace Learning & Development Trends, SHRMEmployee Engagement vs. Employee Satisfaction and Organizational Culture, GallupU.S. Employee Engagement Data Hold Steady in First Half of 2021, GallupEmployee Engagement, Gallup\n\nNo Data\n\nNo Data\n\nNo Data",
